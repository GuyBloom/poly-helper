The psyche is defined by the antagonistic relationship between the individual and society, created through a fundamental rupture by language. Entering language means we give up every being whole because there is always a fundamental part of ourselves we cannot express, the lack. We misrecognize certain desires as that access to full-expression, but that is ontologically impossible.

The 1AC imagines a realm of self-expression that some other has access too. That is a fantasy, they have misrecognized that form of expression as wholeness. That means at best they frustrate themselves as they never can achieve the level of self-expression they idolize. 

That also turns case. The strongest force in the psyche is to self-sabotage as we return closer to a stage of wholeness pre-language, creating the death drive. You can extend Rogers here, since this means their political imaginary gets colonized from the status quo. We only have the ability to imagine societies in relation to the current one, so they can only resist masters but not mastery. This means the 1AC causes things like violent color-checking to replace what was there before.
