actant, "A structural unit of Narratology
proposed in Greimas (1966). Sentences have six
actants, comprising three Binary oppositions.
Each pair epitomizes a fundamental narrative
element: subject/object refers to desire, sender/
receiver to communication, and helper/opponent
to secondary assistance or interference. This
structure is posited as basic to all narrative."
