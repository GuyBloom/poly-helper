Kojève’s interpretation of history ending with capitalism suggests a world free of ideological conflict, yet the text illustrates ongoing conflicts and exclusions within American society.",52.300000000000004,44.379999999999995
1,"Girard, René (1923–)",0.4786200583593583,"Girard, René: Girard’s theory of mimetic desire, where desire is imitative and mediated by a third party, parallels the text’s discussion of Asian Americans’ unattainable desire for whiteness. This mediated desire creates conflict and unresolved grief, similar to the melancholia described by Freud, as Asian Americans strive for an ideal that remains perpetually out of reach.",52.14,37.81
2,discourse,0.4920253217090913,"discourse: The concept of discourse, as discussed by Benveniste and others, relates to how language and societal narratives shape the experiences of marginalized groups.

3,"Freud, Sigmund (1856–1939)",0.5009667925726506,"Freud, Sigmund: Freud’s distinction between mourning and melancholia is central to the text’s argument. The inability of Asian Americans to resolve the loss of the ideal of whiteness, resulting in a state of melancholia, aligns with Freud’s description of melancholia as an interminable grief where the lost object is incorporated into the ego, causing profound psychic pain and self-reproach.",49.9,4.03
4,psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism,0.5122112660677061,"psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism: The application of Freud’s psychoanalytic theory to social phenomena, as seen in the text, demonstrates how unresolved grief and melancholia can be understood not just as individual psychopathologies but as socially determined conditions. The text’s use of psychoanalysis to explore the effects of assimilation and racialization highlights the broader applicability of Freud’s ideas beyond clinical settings.",48.78,1.31
5,diversity and culture,0.5136935516279235,"diversity and culture: The text's exploration of the challenges faced by Asian Americans in assimilating into American culture underscores the importance of recognizing and valuing cultural diversity.

(1903–69)",0.5156157487001527,"Adorno, Theodor W.: Adorno’s critique of the culture industry and the homogenization of culture resonates with the text’s discussion of the unattainability of whiteness for Asian Americans. The text highlights how mainstream cultural norms and ideals, which Adorno critiques, contribute to the melancholic state experienced by marginalized groups who are excluded from these ideals.",48.44,0.9299999999999999
7,"uncanny, the",0.5303671335434448,"uncanny, the: Freud’s concept of the uncanny, where the familiar becomes unfamiliar, parallels the text’s discussion of Asian Americans’ experience of being perpetual foreigners.

(1941–)",0.534131427032327,"Krauss, Rosalind E.: Krauss’s critique of myths about viewing the art object relates to the text’s challenge to the myth of the American melting pot.
