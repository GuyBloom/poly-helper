0,racial neoliberalism,0.4521312698223856,"Racial neoliberalism relates to the text through its critique of how colorblind policies and meritocracy perpetuate racial inequalities. The text's mention of environmental violence against black communities, such as the displacement caused by flooding in Central Park, exemplifies this. The reterritorialization of nature by the state, which the text argues leads to violence and instrumentalization, parallels the way racial neoliberalism masks systemic racism under the guise of equality and individual merit.",54.790000000000006,23.41
1,"Arendt, Hannah (1906–75)",0.45318871077725165,"Hannah Arendt's ideas on totalitarianism and the reduction of politics to labor and work are reflected in the text's critique of the state’s reterritorialization and instrumentalization of nature. Arendt’s notion of political stability being idealized by philosophers is akin to the text’s argument that the state captures natural resources for violent ends. The text’s emphasis on becoming-animal, becoming-plant, and becoming-water to deconstruct normative understandings aligns with Arendt’s critique of the subordination of politics to labor and work.",54.67999999999999,20.97
2,cultural anthropology,0.45501908847626304,"Cultural anthropology's study of human adaptation through culture rather than genetics aligns with the text’s call for a philosophical project that embraces becoming-animal, becoming-plant, and becoming-water. The text argues for traversing imposed binaries to create new understandings of bodies, water, and the planet. This approach echoes cultural anthropology's emphasis on teaching cultural lifeways for survival and adaptation, highlighting the importance of cultural rather than genetic inheritance.",54.50000000000001,17.51
3,"Castoriadis, Cornelius (1922–1997)",0.4626421105621976,"Cornelius Castoriadis's concept of the social imaginary, which shapes our understanding of reality, is relevant to the text's critique of the state's apparatus of capture. The text argues that the state creates a fiction that captures natural and human resources for violent purposes. Castoriadis’s idea that the imaginary institutes the moment of singularity in any sociohistorical formation parallels the text’s call for new nomadic people and a new earth, challenging the state’s imposed narratives.",53.74,8.19
4,erotica,0.46272834229851956,"The distinction between erotica and pornography, as discussed by Audre Lorde, parallels the text's argument for an ethical subjectivity that respects the natural flux rather than instrumentalizing it. The text calls for a micropolitical orientation that lets the flux of nature exist, similar to how Lorde distinguishes erotica as an empowering, affective medium. Both critiques emphasize the importance of moving beyond exploitative, instrumentalized views to foster more ethical and respectful approaches.",53.73,8.110000000000001
5,humanism,0.4653143710074873,"Humanism, in its various forms, is questioned in the text's call to move beyond anthropocentric views. The text argues for reorienting ecopolitical frames outside the state’s apparatus of capture, which aligns with critiques of humanism’s anthropocentrism and ethnocentrism. The text’s emphasis on becoming-animal, becoming-plant, and becoming-water challenges traditional humanist views that prioritize human interests and rationality.",53.47,6.25
6,subject of the enunciation (also subject of the enounced),0.46617684624547984,"The subject of the enunciation, introduced by Emile Benveniste and expanded by Jacques Lacan, can be seen in the text’s critique of the state’s imposition of fixed identities. The text argues that the state creates forms of internal policing, forcing minoritarian individuals to conform to ideal forms. This reflects Benveniste’s distinction between the subject of the enunciation and the subject of the enounced, highlighting the gap between imposed identities and individual self-perception.",53.38,5.71
7,"Said, Edward William (1935–2003)",0.47082680907814034,"Edward Said's work on culture and imperialism is mirrored in the text's discussion of environmental degradation and violence. Said’s analysis of Western discourses about the Orient and the Palestinian struggle for a homeland parallels the text’s critique of the state’s reterritorialization of nature and its violent impacts on marginalized communities. Both critiques emphasize the importance of challenging dominant narratives and creating new, more inclusive understandings.",52.92,3.61
8,sociology of knowledge,0.47131522161699135,"The sociology of knowledge, which examines how knowledge is shaped by social contexts, is reflected in the text’s analysis of how the state constructs and enforces certain narratives. The text argues that the state’s apparatus of capture naturalizes conditions for violence and instrumentalizes nature, similar to how the sociology of knowledge critiques the ways in which social and ideological contexts shape what is considered knowledge or truth.",52.87,3.4299999999999997
9,"Habermas, Jürgen (1929–)",0.4732912006322726,"Jürgen Habermas's concept of communicative rationality, which emphasizes understanding and consensus, aligns with the text's call for ethical subjectivities and micropolitical strategies. The text argues for a new approach to ecopolitical frames that fosters ethical subjectivities and lets the flux of nature exist. This emphasis on consensual, non-coercive interaction mirrors Habermas’s idea of communicative rationality as a basis for social integration and coordination.",52.669999999999995,2.81
