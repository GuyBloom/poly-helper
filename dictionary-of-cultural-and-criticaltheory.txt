`actant 
A structural unit of Narratology
proposed in Greimas (1966). Sentences have six
actants, comprising three Binary oppositions.
Each pair epitomizes a fundamental narrative
element: subject/object refers to desire, sender/
receiver to communication, and helper/opponent
to secondary assistance or interference. This
structure is posited as basic to all narrative.

`Adorno, Theodor W. (1903–69) 
German philosopher, musicologist and cultural critic. A
prominent member of the Frankfurt school of
critical theorists. Alongside Husserl, Heidegger,
Gadamer, and Wittgenstein, Adorno is one of
the most important German-language philosophers of the century. The range and volume of
his output is enormous (Adorno, 1970b). It
includes studies of central figures in the German
philosophical tradition (Hegel, Kierkegaard,

Husserl, Heidegger), monographs and essays on
composers (Wagner, Mahler, Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Berg), four volumes of Literary criticism,
a variety of sociological writings, and numerous
essays and fragments of cultural criticism. Most
significant, however, are three works of outstanding philosophical originality: Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944), cowritten with Horkheimer,
Negative Dialectics (1966) and the posthumously
published Aesthetic Theory (1970a).
Son of an assimilated Jewish wine merchant
and a Corsican Catholic mother, who was a
professional singer, Adorno’s early years were
comfortable and precocious. Whereas Benjamin’s
childhood provided him with a model of the way
frustration gives rise to the power of the wish,
Adorno’s seems to have furnished him with an
experience of fulfillment against which to measure the privations of later life. (Symptomatically,
perhaps, Adorno was his mother’s name. He
exchanged it for his patronymic Wiesengrund in
the late 1930s.)
Adorno came to both music and philosophy
young. Having trained in piano as a child, and
acquired a doctorate (on Husserl’s phenomenology) by the age of 21, he studied composition
for two years in Vienna as a student of Alban
Berg, before returning to Frankfurt to prepare
his Habilitationsschrift (the thesis required for a
tenured position in a German university) on
“The concept of the unconscious in the transcendental theory of the mind” (1927). This

as manifestations of an historical reason. His
means was a renewal of dialectical thought in the
wake of the regression of the Marxist critique of
Hegel, back into the sclerotic form of the system
it had set out to explode.
To begin with, Adorno adopted an essentially
hermeneutical model of philosophy as interpretation, derived from Benjamin’s appropriation
of the early German Romantics’ conception of
criticism. However, this was soon replaced with
his own distinctive notion of philosophy as a
particular kind of experience: “second reflection”
or reflection upon the (reflective) relationship
between subject and object constitutive of other
types of experience. Like the concept of Negative
dialectics to which it gave rise, this idea may
be viewed as a compromise formation midway
between the thought of Kant and Hegel.
Philosophy aspires to the standpoint of the
transcendental, the unconditioned, yet it exists
only in historically specific and thus socially
restricted forms. If it is to be true to itself, it must
incorporate a consciousness of its own limitations
into its reflections on other forms of experience.
It must combat the delusion of an achieved universality, without falling back into an affirmation
of the merely existent. This is the trick of a negative dialectics: to refuse to foreclose the endless
movement of reflection between the universality
of reason and the particularity of experience,
whereby each corrects the one-sidedness of the
other and renders it determinate in its historically
specific form.
Adorno thus combines a Kantian emphasis
on the limits of reason with Hegel’s sense of
dialectical reflection as absolute productivity. The
difference from Hegel is that the absolute is
never achieved. It is the speculative horizon of
all thought concerned with truth (as opposed to
mere knowledge, which is the business of science),
and as such is constitutive of philosophical experience. Yet as soon as it is given a positive charcterization, it is falsified. This is the meaning of two
of Adorno’s best-known aphorisms: “The whole
is the untrue” (Adorno, 1951) and “Universal history must be constructed and denied” (Adorno,
1966).
In line with these ideas, Adorno’s output may
be divided into three basic kinds: social critiques
of philosophies, philosophical criticism of culture,
and more purely philosophical works in which

Adorno, Theodor W.

ambitious attempt at an unorthodox NeoKantian reading of Freud, with Marxist conclusions, was unsuccessful in gaining Adorno the
right to teach, but it indicates the scope of his
interests at the time.
In 1928 he became the editor of the Viennese
musical journal Anbruch, and turned to a study
of Kierkegaard for a fresh attempt at his Habilitation. Along with this study of Kierkegaard
(Adorno, 1933), which was published in Germany
on the day Hitler came to power, two other early
(posthumously published) pieces stand out as
representative statements of Adorno’s project:
“The actuality of philosophy,” his inaugural
lecture at the University of Frankfurt, and “The
idea of natural history,” a talk to the Frankfurt
branch of the Kant Society (Adorno, 1931; 1932).
All three are characterized by the methodological influence of Benjamin’s Origin of German
Tragic Drama (1928a), hostility to Heidegger’s
Existentialism (which had already achieved
considerable impact by the early 1930s), and
a stylistic debt to Schoenberg’s compositional
technique – features which Adorno’s writings
retained, in one way or another, to the end.
Adorno’s philosophical position developed
significantly during his period of exile from
Germany (1934–50), initially in Oxford, then
later, along with the rest of the Frankfurt school
in the United States; in part as a result of his
collaboration with Horkheimer, in part as a consequence of his ongoing debate with Benjamin,
which continued, internalized, long after the
latter’s death. Yet the broad parameters of his
thought remained remarkably stable. They may
be summarized as follows: interrogation of the
possibility and form of philosophy after the critique
of idealism (the recognition of the insufficiency
of thought to grasp “the totality of the real”); insistence on the historical character of philosophies
as idealized reflections of the logic of social forms;
preoccupation with the constitutive separation of
the enlightenment conception of “reason” from the
sensuous particularity of the aesthetic, and its deleterious effects on the formation of subjectivity.
At the center of each lies a tension between the
immanence of critique and the aspiration to
transcendence inherent in the universality of the
concept of reason. Adorno’s overriding goal was
the productive maintenance of this tension, in
the exposition of cultural practices and products

Adorno, Theodor W.

the theoretical terms of the other writings are
expounded in their own right. It is for his cultural
criticism that Adorno is justly most famous. Yet
this is more or less unintelligible without a sense
of its philosophical rationale. The absence of
such a sense has produced a grossly distorted
image of Adorno’s Cultural theory in Englishlanguage media studies and Cultural studies
to date, and precluded a productive engagement
with it from within these disciplines. For them,
it is simply another version of the pessimistic
elitism of the mandarin defense of High culture
(and its aspiration to a transcendent truth) against
its “contamination” by mass culture.
Yet this is to overlook the fundamental principle of Adorno’s cultural criticism: namely, that
the “high” and the “low” are complementary parts
of a larger whole. As Adorno put it in a letter to
Benjamin: they are “torn halves of an integral
freedom to which however they do not add up.”
Both, he argued, “bear the stigmata of capitalism”
and both “contain elements of change.” He
thought it romantic to sacrifice one to the other,
since it is “the division itself ” which is the truth
(Adorno, 1936).
However, within this framework, there is no
doubt that Adorno himself had considerably
more sympathy for the modernist avant-garde than
he did for that part of the truth embodied in
its mass-cultural other. He saw the former as
guided by a moment of artistic autonomy (and
hence as potentially critical of the existing state
of affairs), while the latter was too dependent on
preestablished conditions of reception to have
more than a passive relationship to truth. This
opposition is most notoriously summed up in the
contrast between Adorno’s intellectual enthusiasm
for Schoenberg’s “new music” and his brutal
dimissal of jazz (Adorno, 1955).
Of particular note are the different ways in
which the commodification of culture is taken to
affect the two domains. In Schoenberg’s case, the
status of the music as a commodity is understood
to be resisted internally, by the music itself. Its
social form is incorporated into the musical
materials, and critically reflected through its
Mediation with the history of music, to which
the music consequently contributes something
new. Commodification is a part of what the
music is about. In the case of jazz, on the other
hand, the commodity form is taken to dominate

the musical form, which provides its listeners
with “a few simple recipes,” gratifying a conformist desire for the reproduction of the familiar. In neither case is the criterion of judgment
the affirmation of Culture (Kultur) as a spiritual
Value. Rather, it is the capacity of the work to
criticize the existing state of society. In this
respect, the writings on jazz may be accused of
failing to live up to Adorno’s own model of
dialectical criticism.
Adorno’s cultural writings are distinctive in
treating what is often thought of as “popular” culture as a product of the Culture industries.
“Mass” culture is conceived as an industrial
product, central to the ideological manipulation
of desire and need. This raises the question
of Adorno’s relationships to Marxism and
Psychoanalysis.
On the one hand, in part because of his technical musicological knowledge, Adorno is probably the most important philosopher of musical
modernism; on the other, he is the theorist
who has most directly and consistently applied
Marx’s political economy to the analysis of
cultural form. Marxist theory played two main
roles in Adorno’s work. It provided him with a
materialist critique of traditional philosophy as a
realm of alienated universality or “bad” abstraction, and it endowed him (via Lukács) with the
concept of Reification – the development of an
aspect of Marx’s account of commodity fetishisms.
(In commodity fetishism, the commodity is mystified by taking on attributes which properly belong
to people. In reification, relations between people
assume the form of relations between things.)
Adorno interpreted Marx’s theory of value
as a sociology of cultural form. Later (Adorno
and Horkheimer, 1944), utilizing elements of
Nietzsche’s anthropology, he extended this reading into a critique of the structure of equivalence
inherent in thought itself. The relationship of
exchange between commodities, whereby each is
reduced to its equivalent value (socially necessary
labour time) becomes the interpretative model
for the communicative dimension of instrumental reason, whereby each object is reduced to an
common set of abstract properties (pragmatically
defined by the interest of self-preservation).
Adorno called this form of thought identitythinking, in contrast to the non-identity of negative dialectics.

15
Adorno’s prohibition on positive totalizations,
either they violate it or they must be interpreted
in another, more negative way: as provocations,
perhaps, stylistically deliberate exaggerations.
(“Only the exaggerations are true” is another of
Adorno’s well-known aphorisms about Psychoanalysis.) All of Adorno’s writings display an
acute sensitivity to the question of philosophical
language. In this respect, it is Minima Moralia:
Reflections from Damaged Life (1951), more of a
cross between Friedrich Schlegel’s Philosophical
Fragments and Benjamin’s One-Way Street (1928)
than anything like a work in the philosophy of
history, which is his most characteristic work.
Attacked from a variety of positions since the late
1960s for their pessimistic attitude to political
change, and their rigorous theoretical negativity,
Adorno’s writings have recently been the object
of a revived interest. This has mainly concerned
the rich theoretical detail of Adorno’s Aesthetics,
but the advent of Poststructuralism has provided a broader context for the reconsideration
of Adorno’s place in the history of philosophy.
The relevance of his work to current debates in
both philosophical and cultural theory remains a
heated issue.

Adorno’s Marxism is thus at once apparently
orthodox in its assertion of the law of value, yet
radically heterodox in its allegorical expansion of
its scope to cover the totality of human relations
across the whole of human history. (For Marx, it
applied only to the capitalist mode of production.)
Originally developed by Lukács to explain the
barriers to the emergence of a revolutionary
subjectivity, at a particular stage of capitalist
development, reification becomes descriptive of
a permanent feature of the human condition, so
far. This process reaches its apogee in the thesis
of the “totally administered society,” a nightmare scenario provocatively sketched by Adorno
and Horkheimer as a warning of the developmental tendencies of capitalist and state socialist
societies alike in the postwar period. (The thesis
was popularized in the 1960s by Marcuse in
One-Dimensional Man (Marcuse, 1964).)
Abstracted from the broader context of Marxist
theory (and particularly from its account of class
relations, which Adorno considered empirically
outdated) and generalized, the idea of reification
has more in common with a paranoid version of
Max Weber’s “iron cage” of societal rationalization than anything recognizably Marxist, although
it does resonate with a certain Trotskyist hostility to bureaucracy. (Adorno shared an extremely
hostile attitude to developments in the Soviet
Union.) Adorno’s use of psychoanalytic concepts is similarly unorthodox, yet also immensely
suggestive.
Following the pioneering early work of Eric
Fromm (1932), psychoanalytical concepts are
transferred from the level of the individual to the
domain of the social and historical, in a number
of different ways. Sometimes the transference is
allegorical – in the characterization of fascism as
the “revenge of repressed nature,” for example.
Elsewhere it is more systematic, such as in the large
collective empirical study The Authoritarian
Personality (Adorno et al., 1950), although this
work, through which Adorno was known in the
English-speaking world until the late 1960s, is,
ironically, methodologically extemely atypical of
his thought.
Adorno’s more grandiose historico-philosophical
speculations were the product of his collaboration
with Horkheimer: the “shared philosophy” to
which he so often referred. They are highly
ambiguous, for if they are read in the context of

`aesthetics 
The reflection on art and beauty
is allegedly to be found in several different cultures at several different periods. The philosophical sophistication of such reflection in Ancient
Greece is attested by Plato’s Hippias Major and
Aristotle’s Poetics, which were formative texts
for the Western tradition, but until very recently
there was nothing in this tradition comparable
with the level of Chinese reflection on painting
reached in a text such as Chang Yen-yüan’s ninthcentury Li-Tai Ming-hua Chi (Record of Famous
Paintings). Yet it would be extremely imprudent
to collect these and other examples of reflection
on art and beauty under the title of “aesthetics.”
The latter is not only of modern origin, but its
preoccupations, direction of analysis, and consequently its internal system of division and classification are specifically European and should
not be applied to either premodern or nonEuropean materials.
The term is first used in connection with art
and beauty by the German rationalist philosopher
Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in his Reflections
on Poetry (1735) and developed subsequently in
his Aesthetica (1750–8). In the former Baumgarten
introduced aesthetics at the very end of his
analysis, referring to the Greek origins of the
term in the contrast between aestheta or “things
perceived” and noeta or “things known.” The
reasons for coining the new term were twofold.
Baumgarten was a follower of the German rationalist philosopher Christian Wolff, and was
responding to two problems in the Wolffian
philosophy. The first was the place of Art within
a rational system of philosophy; the second the
relationship between reason and sensibility. He
began writing the Reflections in the form of a commentary on Horace’s Ars Poetica in order to
solve the first problem, but realized in the course
of composition that the two problems were
related: beauty was none other than rational
perfection expressed in sensuous form. The outcome in both the Reflections and the Aesthetica was
a systematically equivocal definition of aesthetics
as, on the one hand, a doctrine of sensibility, and
on the other, a philosophy of art.
The equivocation persists in Kant’s extremely
influential use of the term: in the Critique of Pure
Reason (1781) aesthetic refers to the analysis of
sensibility and the forms of intuition space and
time; yet in the Critique of Judgement (1790) it

refers to the philosophical analysis of beauty.
Kant’s analysis in the latter text, seen by many as
inaugurating modern European aesthetics, may
be read in two ways. In the first reading, Kant presents a justification of the universality and necessity of aesthetic judgment, one concerned largely
with the reception of art, but with hints of an
account of its production in the discussion of
“genius.” In the second reading, however, Kant
is seen as critically undermining the dominant,
modern philosophical Discourses on beauty
and art – Baumgarten’s “aesthetics” and the
theory of “taste” – and leaving the outcome
open, content to point to the paradoxes which
inevitably beset modern philosophical reflection
upon art and beauty.
At stake in the two readings of Kant is nothing less than the validity of the aesthetic form
of reflection on art outside of the temporally
and geographically specific confines of the culture
from which it emerged. The first reading accepts
that aesthetic judgments may be universally and
necessarily valid, while the second is skeptical
of any such claim. The latter view suggests that
aesthetics as the philosophical discourse on art and
beauty is inseparable from a system of culturally
specific oppositions, of which the most significant
are “sense and reason,” “matter and form,”
“spirit and letter,” “expression and expressed,”
“pleasure and finality,” and “freedom and necessity.” On this view aesthetics as a discourse on art
and beauty remains firmly within the parameters
of these oppositions, however ingeniously they
may be refined or developed.
For this reason critics of aesthetics maintain
that it should not uncritically be extended to the
works of art and criticism of other cultures and
periods. On this view, to speak of “medieval aesthetics” or the “aesthetics of Japanese calligraphy”
is to subordinate these discourses and objects to
a modern, Western European System of values.
It is of course possible to apply the aesthetic
distinctions of “matter and form” or “sense and
reason” to Tang dynasty painting or to Chang
Yen-yüan’s treatise, but only at the risk of losing
much of its significance in the course of translation into the terms of aesthetics. For this reason
twentieth-century meditations on art such as
those of Heidegger in his “Dialogue of language” and Beckett in “Three dialogues” choose
deliberately to suspend the received framework of

`affective fallacy
 A term central to New criticism, which derives from the title of an essay
by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley,
“The affective fallacy” (1949). The essay seeks to
promote an “objective criticism” in which attention is directed exclusively to the artifact itself.
Its purported “classical objectivity” (as against
“romantic reader psychology”) concerns itself
with giving an account of the poem (the New
Critics tend to privilege Poetry in their work, but
the concept is equally applicable to other genres)
as the cause of an emotion, rather than of the
emotion expressed or effected by the poem.

`African philosophy 
The qualification of
philosophy as “African” is consistent with the
custom of naming philosophical traditions and
practices according to their cultural, ethnic,
national, or merely geographic origins, thus we have
“American philosophy,” “Jewish philosophy,”
“British philosophy,” “German philosophy,”
or “French philosophy.” Following Vincent
Descombes (1980) who defines “contemporary
French philosophy” as “coincident with the sum
of the discourses elaborated in France and considered by the public of today as philosophical,”
African philosophy may be said to consist of all
intellectual and discursive productions elaborated in Africa and considered “philosophical” by
today’s public. But this imitative definition fails
to capture the historical, political, and cultural
contradictions and complexities which animate the
historical dynamics of “African philosophy” as an
academic and professional tradition.

For example, when one attempts to extend the
meaning of the qualifier “African” beyond the
scope of its geographical meaning, it becomes
notoriously difficult to define what kind of
philosophical production is “African” or not. If
the designation “African philosophy” is meant
to highlight the ethnic/cultural origin of the philosophy in question, then should one not speak
of African philosophies rather than philosophy in
the singular, since Africa is made up of markedly
diverse ethnic/cultural sources/traditions that constitute the philosophic originations? Or is the
African identity of a philosopher – irrespective of
method or content of her/his philosophy – necessary and/or sufficient to warrant the qualification
of such philosophy as belonging to the African
tradition? What are the credentials of an intellectual
work that would be simultaneously “philosophy”
and “African?”
Since the end of the 1939–45 war attempts by
African (and non-African) philosophers to answer
the above questions have generated debates that
dominate contemporary discussions on African
philosophy. Some thinkers have sought to write
the history of African philosophy by appealing to
the Egyptian origins of Western philosophy, and
then arguing that ancient Egyptian philosophy
and science represent the classical flourishing
of civilizations that originated and remained
influential in “the Heart of Negro lands” (the
Nubia, Galla, Zimbabwe, Somalia, etc.) (Diop,
1974). In addition to Chiek Anta Diop, other
scholars who take this “ancient Egypt” route in
the (re)construction of the history of African
philosophy include Theophilus Obenga (1973;
1990), Osabutey (1936), G. James (1954), and
Henry Olela (1980), and their works have found
considerable support from Martin Bernal’s influential volumes The Black Athena (1987–). Other
philosophers such as Lacinay Keita, however,
(re)construct a history of African philosophy
by tracing/documenting the trajectory of philosophical activities from ancient and medieval
Islamic north Africa (Timbuktu, Songhai, the
Ghana empire, and the Sudanic states of central
Africa). It is pointed out that the north African–
Arab Islamic scholarship of about the seventh
century ad and onwards was instrumental in the
translation and transmission of Greek philosophy,
especially the “pagan” Aristotle and his (re)introduction into the European philosophical world.

(In general, the contribution of the Arab philosophers such as Avicenna and Averroes are also
highlighted in this connection.) For example,
the efforts of Claude Sumner to translate, document, and analyze the works of the sixteenthcentury Abyssinian rationalist philosopher Zär’a
Ya’eqob (1599–1692), Wäldä Heywat, and Skendes,
and the resurgent interests in the translation
and analysis of the writings of William Amo,
a Ghanaian philosopher who taught at the
universities of Halle, Wittenberg, and Jena in
eighteenth-century Germany, are Paradigmatic
of the quest for historical reconstruction of past
philosophical enterprises in Africa.
Yet there is no disputing the fact that the single
most important impetus that drives the contemporary field of African philosophy as a disciplinary
and professional–academic enterprise goes beyond
the technical desire to ascertain its Egyptian, Arab,
or Abyssinian origins; rather, this motive must
be traced to an experience of crisis. The brutal
encounter of the African world with European
modernity constitutes a crisis of indescribable
proportions whose tragic reality and history is
incarnated and marked in the institutions of
slavery, colonialism, and the ideologies of European cultural and racial superiority.
Natural historians, anthropologists, and philosophers of the European Enlightenment
speculated widely on the nature of the African
“mind” which they generally agreed was “magical,”
“mystical,” “irrational,” and therefore “inferior.”
For example, the philosophers Hume, Kant,
and Hegel each depicted the African world as
“dark,” “savage,” “primitive,” etc. The institution
of anthropology as a scientific discipline subsequently lent scientific respectability to these
speculations, and so we have Lévy-Bruhl and
Evans-Pritchard producing works that described
the African mind as either prelogical or “mystical” (as opposed to “rational”). These anthropological productions, often commissioned after
the military invasion of an African territory or after
a rebellion against occupying European powers
(Asad, 1973; Achebe, 1988), were intended to
provide the European administrations and missionary cultural workers with information about
the “primitive” African mind, so that they could
properly inculcate into the African conscience
European values and cultural attitudes. It is
within this context that the significance of Father

Placide Tempels’s controversial book, Bantu Philosophy (1945), must be understood. As stated by
the author, the aim of the book is to teach the
colonialists the cultural “philosophy,” or more
strictly, the world view and the belief systems of
the African in order that the European evangelization and “civilizatory” work will succeed, and
succeed in a self-sustaining manner. Tempels’s
book is therefore predominantly a work of exposition of the ontological systems of the Baluba, an
ethnic group in Zaire where Tempels, a Belgian
Franciscan missionary, worked for many years.
Tempels believed that the Baluba–African ontology
grounds and regulates the daily ethical, political,
and economic existence of the African, and
therefore in order to elevate the “pagan” existence
of the African to “civilization,” one must work
through this ontological system which grounds the
existential interiority of the Bantu.
However, the historical significance of Tempels’s
work lies in the author’s explicit use of the term
“philosophy” in the title of the book to designate
an intellectual product associated with the African,
in this case the Bantu of Zaire. Whereas the
anthropologist spoke of savage “mentality” or
primitive “thought,” Tempels spoke of philosophy;
and this designation is crucial because philosophy,
to the Western mind, is the honorific term
symbolizing the highest exercise of the faculty
of reason. To acknowledge the existence of an
African philosophy, then, is to acknowledge the
existence of African reason, and hence African
humanity. This notion flies in the face of the entire
edifice of colonialism which was built precisely
on the negation of this possibility. The African
is subhuman because s/he is “irrational,” “prelogical,” etc., and therefore can never produce
philosophy: hence, the revolutionary potential of
Bantu Philosophy.
Tempels’s book, then, was fruitfully ambiguous. The author intended it to be a “handbook”
for the missionary cultural worker: a plea to the
European colonialist administrator or missionary
that the African’s “philosophy” and culture ought
to be understood and respected in order for the
“civilizing” mission to succeed. However, the
ambiguous yet fruitful conjunction of “philosophy” as an implicit ontological system which
underlies and sustains an African communal
world view, and the honorific notion of “philosophy” as the highest rational (human) achievement

19
these practices. African philosophy, in this sense,
became the analysis of cultural/oral institutional
and linguistic traditions, such as Alexis Kagame’s
La Philosophie Bantoue–Rwandaise de l’Être (1956)
or Barry Hallen and J.O. Sodipo’s “analytic experiments” in Yoruba philosophy (1986). Kwame
Gyekye’s An Essay in African Philosophical Thought:
The Akan Conceptual Scheme (1987) and William
Abraham’s The Mind of Africa (1962), or the
Reverend John Mibiti’s popular African Philosophy
and Religions (1992) may be classified as belonging to this ethnophilosophic strand.
The second strand, inspired more indirectly by
Tempels’s work, developed more overtly political,
anti-colonial, and ideological tendencies. Freedom
fighters and political leaders such as Nnamdi
Azikiwe and Obafemi Awolowo in Nigeria, Julius
Nyerere in Tanzania, Leopold Sedar Senghor
in Senegal, Oginga Odinga in Kenya, Kenneth
Kaunda in Zambia, and most of all, Kwame
Nkrumah of Ghana each produced varying
amounts of philosophical-political works that
have recourse to resilient elements of native
African cultural traditions. In traditions such as
communalism, these leaders and thinkers endeavored to elicit and develop various forms of
“African socialism” and ideological theories of
cultural “authenticity” that would empower Africa
to emancipate itself and build an autonomous
future. Representative works in this area are
Nyerere’s Ujamma: Essays On Socialism (1968),
Nkrumah’s Consciencism: Philosophy and Ideology
for Decolonization and Development with Particular
Reference to the African Revolution (1964), or
Senghor’s three-volume Liberté (1964; 1971;
and 1977). This trend in the development of
African philosophy is called “political-ideological
philosophy.”
Tempels and ethnophilosophy, however, have
always had their critics (such as Franz Crahay,
Robin Horton, etc.); but especially since the
mid-1970s in Africa, there has arisen a loose
group of African philosophers, highly trained in
the techniques of modern Western philosophy,
usually in French and British universities, who
designated themselves as “professional philosophers” and who constituted themselves as a
group in/through their mutual opposition to the
idea of philosophy propagated by Tempels and
his disciples. Included in this group are Paulin
Houtondji, Odera Oruka, Kwasi Wiredu, and

African philosophy

was not lost on the emerging African intelligentsia. Tempels’s book collapsed the ideological
scaffold that had supported racism and colonialism, and the book became for these Africans a
manual for revolt.
With the discovery in Africa of “Bantu philosophy,” and the emergence in the United States
of the Harlem Renaissance – with its philosophers
and intellectuals, Alain Locke, Claude McKay,
W.E.B. Du Bois and others – where Africans in
the diaspora were already engaged in the critique
of African colonialism and the racism of the
New World, a third movement in the history
of African philosophy was born: Négritude. As a
literary and cultural/philosophical movement
originated in Paris by African and Afro-Caribbean
students, Négritude, through Aimé Césaire and
Leopold Sedar Senghor among others, found in
Bantu Philosophy and in the pluralist anthropologies of Frobenius, Herskovits, and Delafosse
sympathetic arguments to show that Africa has
“philosophy.” Each of the three movements
mentioned above prompted reexaminations of
various European theorizings about Africa and the
African “mind,” such as those of Hume, Kant,
Hegel and evolutionist anthropology. The idea of
“African philosophy” as a field of inquiry thus has
its contemporary roots in the effort of African
thinkers to examine, question, and contest identities imposed upon them by Europeans; and
the claims and counterclaims, justifications, and
Alienations that characterize such contests
indelibly mark the discipline.
Two of the earliest strands that developed
out of this African attempt were both a counter
Discourse and a theoretical articulation and
(re)construction of a historical and cultural
autonomy: the “ethnophilosophy” strand remained
faithful to Tempels and continued the traditions
of exposing and analyzing African world views to
elicit and distill ontologies, Ethics, metaphysics,
political and aesthetic theories from the languages and other cultural institutions of the
African peoples. Since the West deemed philosophy or the possession of philosophic traditions
as a sign of the attainment of full humanity, it is no
wonder that, in the face of the denigration of their
humanity, the impulse of the Africans thinkers was
to research, using phenomenologic and interpretative methods, their native traditions, customs,
languages, etc. to show the “philosophicness” of

Peter Bodunrin, although each brings specific
emphasis and nuances to his critique of Tempels
and/or ethnophilosophy. This “school” of African
philosophy maintains that, although philosophy
operates within/on a culture, it is a universal,
scientific discipline/method of inquiry, so that to
speak of “African” philosophy is simply to identify either the geographic or the authorial origin
of that particular philosophical work. This group
of self-designated “professional” philosophers
accuses ethnophilosophy of failing to be a “strict”
philosophy because it is communal, relies on
unwritten sources, and, in fact, it is (premodern),
unscientific. For Houtondji (1983), for example,
philosophy is born only where there is (modern)
science, and one cannot (yet) speak of “African
science.” Yet, Oruka, although himself one of
the “professional” philosophers, rejects the negative connotations of some of these conditions,
such as those ascribed to orality. One can say that
Oruka’s well-known University of Nairobi “Sage
Philosophy Project” is a sustained attempt to
overcome the critical questions of orality and
collectivism of thought implied in the criticism
of ethnophilosophy by producing named individuals who do philosophy in the oral tradition.
(See Oruka’s Sage Philosophy: Indigenous Thinkers
and Modern Debates in Philosophy, 1990.) The
other members of the “professional” philosophy
quartet, Wiredu and Bodurin, however, conceive
of philosophy as a specifically modern (European)
invention with a universal method which can be
applied to the analysis and critique of African
Cultures. Wiredu, for example, demonstrates this
in his Philosophy in an African Culture (1980).
Critical ethnophilosophy, as well as works in line
with the modernist streak of the self-proclaimed
“professional” philosophers, are flourishing in
philosophy departments in Africa, and in North
America, an emerging growth area in the field of
African philosophy is in the critical–hermeneutic
and deconstructive trends, where emphasis is
brought to bear on the historical understanding
and interpretation of the African colonial and postcolonial situation in conjunction with, or linked
to the Deconstruction of the Western ideological
and philosophic–epistemological Canons that
theorize the African out of reason and denigrate
African humanity. In this deconstructive vein,
works by V.Y. Mudimbe (1988), Tsenay Serequeberhan (1994), Anthony Appiah (1992), Lucius
Outlaw (1987), Emmanuel Eze (1993), among

others, challenge the longstanding exclusion of
Africa, or more accurately, its inclusion as the
negative “Other” of reason and the Western
World in the mainstream traditions of modern
European philosophy. Their philosophies, in
conjunction with, for example, the feminist and
other marginalized clusters of progressive critique
and critical resistance, excavate and problematize
the significance of race, Gender, and other
cultural embeddedness of philosophical practice
which have been long ignored. For most in this
group, the rereading and reinterpreting of the
precocious works of radical African philosophers
and thinkers such as Frantz Fanon, Amilcar
Cabral, and Aimé Césaire yield the fruits of rapprochement between African and Afro-American
philosophy, as evidenced in the growing interest
in the concept of “Africana philosophy” as an organizing notion for the constellation of the traditions of philosophy in Africa and the diaspora.

is solely a gay male undertaking. For example,
one of the first stories to deal with AIDS in a
mainstream publication is Susan Sontag’s 1986
short story “The way we live now.” In the realm
of nonfiction, some of the earliest writings are
memoirs by mothers who have lost their sons, as
well as wives coping with husbands dying from
AIDS.
In recent years, there has emerged a substantial
body of popular AIDS writing from an openly gay
point of view. Writers such as David Feinberg,
Sarah Schulman, and Thom Gunn, as well as
younger writers whose work is published in compilations, are approaching AIDS with a sense of
honesty and power, foregrounding vital issues
of sexuality and Gender during the time of
an epidemic. The idea that AIDS is strictly a “gay
disease” has led some recent gay male writers, such
as Peter Cameron, to eschew the topic. Yet the
absence of AIDS from some recent gay fiction does
not necessarily connote indifference. Some critics
feel that such an absence disrupts the representation of gay as a “high risk” group. In showing
that there are only “high risk” behaviors, such
absence prevents marginalization of gays. However,
others feel the absence of any discussion of AIDS
ultimately diminishes the work since it is not
fully expressive of modern gay life. Regardless,
AIDS has inevitably changed the way that gay
literature and, quite possibly, all literature is
written and read.
In terms of classification and Genre, literature
dealing with AIDS can be seen as a “literature of
crisis,” a term denoting works emerging from
moments of historical crises, such as the writings
of Jews during the Holocaust as well as AfroAmericans during slavery. Emmanuel S. Nelson
(1992) wishes to resist such comparisons; he
notes that though there are “some formal similarities, ideological affinities, and spiritual connections among” other writings produced during
historical moments of crises, there is a “uniqueness [in] the literature of AIDS” (p. 3). AIDS and
its textual representations exist in a sphere of
overlapping medical, social, and literary discourses associated mainly with those on the
margins (primarily gays, intravenous drug users,
and sex workers). This marginalized status
makes it problematic to place a strict label such
as “literature of crisis” on this body of literature.
This ambiguity in classification extends to
placing such writings in a historical genre.


`AIDS and literature 
Since the mid-1980s,
there has been an artistic response to the AIDS
crisis which crosses various modes of literary
production in both the Western and non-Western
worlds. Though many recent artistic endeavors
reflect the changing ways in which we view sex
and sexuality, a specific literary response addresses
AIDS and its various representations. It is important to note that it is impossible and undesirable
to create a “coherent” body of AIDS literature;
the response is too varied. Yet, with such a disclaimer in mind, this entry will attempt to point out
some of the literature and the critical work emerging in response to the disease, invariably making
such generalizations as one desires to avoid.
In the West, the literary response to AIDS has
largely taken the form of nonfiction and fiction
writings (short stories, novels, and Poetry), while
in non-Western countries, the response is more
closely associated with performance-oriented forms
of Discourse. These responses to the AIDS crisis,
in both the West and non-Western worlds, are intimately connected with theater and other means
of “modern” representation, such as film, television,
newspapers, magazines, informational pamphlets
and, most recently, electronic newsgroups.
This entry will focus solely on the nonfiction
and fiction Writings, excluding drama, since it
is too large a topic to approach here. However,
in limiting the focus to written creative works, the
intent is not to imply that such writings exist outside the sphere of other AIDS Discourses, such
as the medical research and media coverage of the
disease or the academic sociological writings of
activists such as Cindy Patton and Douglas Crimp.
The writings discussed here are inevitably connected with such work; though television movies
on AIDS such as An Early Frost or various
brochures on “safe sex” are not explicitly discussed,
such forms of AIDS representations inform and
overlap in various ways with fiction and nonfiction
writings. The interdisciplinary nature of AIDS
discourse cannot be ignored when considering
AIDS-related literature.
In Western countries, communities of gay men
were among the most traumatized at the beginning of the crisis; therefore much of the writing,
both fiction and nonfiction, is written by gay
male authors, many of whom are suffering
from AIDS or HIV infection. However, as Judith
Lawrence Pastore (1993) points out, it is inaccurate to assume that literature dealing with AIDS

alienation

22
Several essays collected in Nelson’s book address
the topic of genre. Laurel Brodsley finds Daniel
Defoe’s seventeenth-century novel The Journal of
the Plague Year a suitable Paradigm for recent
nonfiction works like Randy Shilts’s And the
Band Played On and Paul Monette’s Borrowed
Time, while Gregory Woods contextualizes poetry
dealing with AIDS in the broader elegiac tradition of English poetry. However, critics such as
Joseph Dewey problematize such stable models for
the literature(s) of AIDS, since such genres as
plague literature or elegies are anachronistic to the
postmodern reality of AIDS and do not encompass the spirit of activist resistance present in
such writings. Robert Franke (1993) feels that the
characteristics of both fiction and nonfiction
AIDS writing suggest the development of a new
genre, one which acknowledges the failure of
modern science to support the complex realities
of human experience.
There is also much discussion on the political
component necessary in literature addressing
AIDS. Pastore assumes that “literary AIDS” must
have clear-cut pedagogical goals, “to dispel unwarranted fears . . . [and] overcome homophobia”
(pp. 3–4). Such politicized goals are indeed
critical and addressed in many AIDS writings,
emerging in large part from the activism with
which many of these writers are concerned.
However, such a limited view of literature dealing with AIDS dismisses the multifaceted levels
on which such writings operate to merely a
political and educational one; aesthetic issues
explored by recent writers are devalued in such
a framework if such experimentation is not
viewed as politically expedient. Such issues, as well
as related questions like whether writings about
AIDS have the ability to create compassion and
understanding about the disease in its readers,
remain highly debatable.
The magnitude of the literary response to
AIDS makes it a difficult task to address in any
significant capacity. Therefore, this overview
inevitably leaves out critical issues and contributions of important writers. The literatures of
AIDS are both omnipresent and unrecognizable
in various degrees. In focusing on one aspect of
the response, this entry cannot help but encounter the other fields responding to AIDS.
Any study attempting an understanding of AIDS
writing must recognize the impact of the media

and the medical field in our understanding of this
disease. Writing AIDS is much more than intertextual; it is a phenomenon of Culture situated
in an overlapping area of discourse which is not
merely a site of academic study, but rather a
matter of life and death.

`alienation
As defined by Marx in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts (1844), alienation is a specific historical condition in which
man experiences a separation from nature, other
human beings, and especially the products of his
labor. Since man creates himself through labor,
all of these forms of alienation imply an alienation
of man from himself. For Hegel, alienation was
a philosophical concept expressing one aspect of
the process of self-objectification: in the dialectical process, Spirit objectified itself in nature (a stage
in which it was alienated from itself ) and then
returned to itself. Marx regards alienation as a
product of the evolution of division of labor,
private property, and the state: when these phenomena reach an advanced stage, as in capitalist

23
classical norms and precepts of genre identity; and
the large-scale “reworking” (Umfunktionierung) of
plays from the established repertoire, such as
Brecht’s treatment of Coriolanus as a commentary on moral and political issues raised by the
East German workers’ rising of 1953. It could
also entail the staging of didactic “parables”
(Lehrstücke) which presented these issues in a
starkly paradoxical form, and which thus held
out against the audience’s so-called “natural”
tendency to identify vicariously with characters
perceived as tragic protagonists or victims of
social injustice. Brecht’s purpose was not (of
course) to lessen our sense of such injustice but
to jolt us into thinking about the events on stage
in a more critical, more detached, and thus
(potentially) more activist mode of concern.

`alienation effect (Verfremdungseffekt)

A term first used by the German Marxist playwright, dramaturge, poet, literary theorist, and
political thinker Bertolt Brecht, deployed in
a variety of contexts to suggest the idea of a
deliberate break with those traditional values
(verisimilitude, unity of action, audience participation, tragic catharsis, the imaginative “suspension of disbelief,” etc.) which Brecht saw as
deeply bound up with the hegemony of bourgeois
aesthetic, social, and political institutions. Hence
– he argued – the need for a truly revolutionary
theater that would exploit every means of disrupting and subverting such routine habits of
response. These might include the introduction
of strikingly anomalous or anachronistic details
in order to break the realist illusion; the use
of conspicuous devices (for example, on-stage
commentary or actors speaking “out of character”) to similar defamiliarizing effect; the
juxtaposition of incongruous styles – including
elements of dance and song – to undermine the

`Althusser, Louis (1918–90)
 French Communist philosopher. One of the most notable
Marxist theoreticians of the postwar period,
Althusser’s comprehensive reconstruction of
Marxist philosophy and social theory won him a
large intellectual following throughout Western
Europe and Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s.
In For Marx and Reading “Capital” (1965),
Althusser and his collaborators (including Etienne
Balibar and Pierre Macherey) subjected actually existing Marxism to swingeing critique on
account of its alleged Hegelianism. According to
Althusser, the seemingly antithetical traditions
of orthodox Marxism (Kautsky or Stalin) and
Western Marxism (Lukács or Sartre) exhibited
the common vice of Historicism. Whether in
the guise of economism or Humanism, both
tendencies cancelled Marx’s departure from the
German idealism of his youth by construing
historical materialism as a philosophy of history.
As pseudo-materialist inversions of Hegelian
theodicy, they each depicted human history as
an expressive totality or process, with an origin,
a center, a subject, and a goal. Economism – typical of Stalinist orthodoxy from the mid-1920s

Althusser, Louis

society, the individual experiences the entire
objective world as a conglomeration of alien
forces standing over and above him. In this
sense, alienation can only be overcome by the
revolutionary abolition of the economic system
based on private property.
Alienation is also a central concept in sociology, a centrality deriving in part from Max
Weber’s recognition of the individual’s feeling of
helplessness in a “disenchanted” world governed
by rational, bureacratic, and impersonal institutions. Existentialists, notably Heidegger and
Sartre, have also centralized this concept, viewing it not as the symptom of given historical
configurations but as a defining condition of
existence. The concept of alienation has also
reverberated widely through the various branches
of psychology.

– constituted a technological Determinism, positing a metanarrative of the advance of the productive forces towards an ineluctable communism.
Humanism – characteristic of the anti-Stalinist
reaction in the 1950s and 1960s – represented a
teleological philosophical anthropology, projecting an odyssey of the human essence, from its
Alienation in Class society to its reappropriation in a classless future. Althusser’s objections
were at once analytical and political: abstracting from the specificities of concrete historical
conjunctures, all such schematism precluded the
requisite comprehension – hence possible transformation – of them.
The Althusserian reformation – the professed
“return to Marx” – encompassed three interdependent endeavors: (i) an epistemological history
of the foundation and development of Marxism
– in the first instance, by a rereading of Marx’s
own heterogeneous oeuvre; (ii) the elaboration of
a historical epistemology which would identify
the substance, and clarify the status, of Marx’s
“materialist conception of history”; and (iii) the
renovation of Historical materialism as a
nonhistoricist theory of modes of production
and Social formations.
The Symptomatic reading of Marx conducted by Althusser revolved around the postulate
of a profound conceptual and epistemological
discontinuity between the supposedly nonMarxist “early works” of 1840–4 and the unevenly
Marxist texts of 1845–6 onwards. The “epistemological break” effected in The German Ideology
(Marx and Engels, 1932) separated distinct and
irreconcilable theoretical “problematics” – the
one, tributary to left-Hegelianism, amounting to
nothing more than the repetition of an ideological philosophy of history; the other, peculiar
to Marx, summing up to nothing less than the
initiation of the science of history. However, this
“theoretical revolution” had merely been commenced by Marx. He had opened up the “continent of History” to scientific exploration – above
all, in the three volumes of Capital – founding a
research program which remained to be developed,
not bequeathing a fixed doctrine which need
only be quoted, by his successors.
The import of Althusser’s interpretation was
affirmation of the scientificity of historical materialism, and yet insistence upon its incompletion, not only as a consequence of the inevitable

limitations of Marx’s own achievement, but
also as a normal correlate of its scientific status.
Althusser renounced the materialist metaphysic
of the Second and Third Internationals, according to which Marxism was a self-sufficient cosmology or “world view,” the accomplished science
of anything, everything and nothing. Instead,
he conceived historical materialism as a “finite”
theory of history, in principle committed to
incessant development and susceptible to recurrent rectification, which did not own exclusive
rights to the production of objective knowledge
of human phenomena. As Francis Mulhern
(1994, p. 160) observes, “[t]he theoretical field
within which [Althusser] situated Marx’s science
was . . . the new ‘quadrivium’ of history, ethnology, psychoanalysis and linguistics, and their
lingua franca, ‘structuralism’. The pursuit of
scientificity here meant the repudiation of intellectual autarky.”
Variously indebted to Spinozist rationalism
and French conventionalist philosophy of science,
Althusserian epistemology therefore rejected the
canonical “dialectical materialism” systematized
by Stalin as the general science of the laws of
nature, history, and thought. Althusser’s alternative – the “theory of theoretical practice” –
sought to secure the cognitive autonomy of the
sciences against the intrusions of politics. At the
same time, it wished to recognize their Relative
autonomy as socio-historical products. It did so
by maintaining that any society was “a complex
unity of ‘social practice’,” which could be divided
into four practices: economic, political, ideological, and theoretical. Each possessed the transformative structure of the labor process as dissected
by Marx, entailing the three “moments” of raw
material, means of production, and product.
Thus, the production of knowledge was the fruit
of theoretical practice, comprising raw material
in the form of existing facts and concepts; means
of production in the shape of a problematic (or
theoretical matrix); and products, knowledge(s).
Contrary to the “empiricist conception of
knowledge,” Althusser conceived the cognitive
process – the production of concepts by means
of concepts – as wholly intra-theoretical. Its
starting point and end product were conceptual
“objects of knowledge.” Via the “theoretical
object” (for example, “Fordism”), knowledge of
a “real object” (for example, contemporary

25
“specific effectivity.” They were not, however,
independent, for they were governed by a “structural causality” whereby economic “determination
in the last instance” operated through the permutation of “dominance” between the various structures in different social formations (in feudal
societies, for example, the political is dominant;
in capitalist, the economic).
The third component of the Althusserian recasting of historical materialism (largely elaborated
by Balibar) bore upon a nonevolutionist theory
of modes of production. Abandoning technological determinism, Balibar reconfigured modes of
production as articulated – and not inherently contradictory – combinations of forces and relations
of production, under the primacy of the latter.
Consequently, they were not transient phenomena whose sequential rise and fall were determined
by iron laws of history, but self-reproducing
totalities. According to Balibar’s account of the
transition from one mode of production to
another, the ultimate “motor of history” was the
struggle between contending social classes.
Yet Marxism was not a Humanism. On Althusser’s understanding of history, it was a “process without a subject,” in which social structures
had primacy over the human agents who were their
“bearers.” Individuals were individuated, constituted as social identities by and in Ideology,
materialized in Ideological state apparatuses (for example, the family and schools), via
the mechanism of Interpellation (1984, pp. 1–
60). Althusser’s fourth contribution to historical
materialism drew upon the psychoanalysis of
Jacques Lacan to theorize ideology as the realm
of the “imaginary.” In it the real relations
between subject and society were inverted, such
that individuals lived those relations as if they were
the “subjects of ” them, rather than “subject to”
them. Ideology was the set of representations of
people’s “imaginary relations” to their conditions
of existence requisite for them to function as social
agents in any conceivable society. There would be
no end to ideology under Communism.
The Althusserian enterprise was one of remarkable scope and originality, seductively combining
political radicalism – a quasi-Maoist stance to the
left of mainstream Communism – and philosophical modernism – selective affinities with structuralism. It came as a liberation to a younger
generation and defined the terms of Marxist

Althusser, Louis

British capitalism) was appropriated in thought.
The theory of theoretical practice aspired to be
both a “materialism,” accepting the primacy of
objective reality, which existed independently of
theories of it; and an anti-empiricism, asserting
the indispensability of theory as the discursive construction of that reality. Furthermore, it maintained
that, once theoretical practices had crossed the
threshold of scientificity, they required neither
philosophical guarantees nor external confirmation of their status; they had their own criteria of
verification.
The Althusserian reconstruction of historical
materialism consisted of four main themes. The
first was a recasting of the Marxist “dialectic.”
Althusser criticized the traditional interpretation
of the Marx–Hegel relationship as the materialist “inversion” of an idealist construct. For him
any such operation preserved the incorrigibly
teleological character of the Hegelian dialectic.
This was true, for example, of economism, wherein
the contradiction between the forces and relations
of production supplied the trans-historical efficient
cause of a unilinear social evolution. Instead,
Althusser postulated the Overdetermination
of any Contradiction. Although hierarchically
organized in a determinate (if variable) order, each
of the multiple contradictions active in any society was internally marked by the others, which
provided its “conditions of existence.” Each was
ineliminably real and effective, simultaneously
determinant and determined. Political revolutions were therefore not the punctual effects of
an economic contradiction that had reached
its maturity, but the contingent results of the
“condensation” of social contradictions in a
“ruptural unity.”
A complementary reconceptualization of social
formations (societies) aimed to respect their constitutive complexity, by displacing the inherited
Base and superstructure topography, and differentiating the Marxist totality from the Hegelian.
Any Social formation – feudal, capitalist,
communist – was a unified but Decentered
structure: a “structure of structures,” subsuming economic, political, and ideological “instances.”
The Marxist totality secreted no essence to be
expressed nor center to be reflected. Its regional
structures were not heteronomous – secondary
phenomena subject to an economic first cause.
Each of them enjoyed relative autonomy and

debate for a period. This was because Althusser
reclaimed historical materialism as an open,
underdeveloped research program, which did
not reduce social phenomena to economic
epiphenomena, but promised to grasp them in
their concrete specificity, as the “synthesis of
many determinations.” As commentators have
demonstrated (Elliott, 1987; Mulhern, 1994),
Althusserianism sponsored a mass of research
and contributed to a series of intellectual initiatives (for example, the literary criticism of Terry
Eagleton, the work of the Centre for contemporary cultural studies, the film theory
of Screen, or the socialist feminism of Juliet
Mitchell).
In jettisoning much of Marx, as well as his
successors, however, Althusserianism represented
an “imaginary Marxism” (a fact its author subsequently acknowledged (1992, p. 221)). Indeed,
in retrospect it can be seen to have constituted
a transitional theoretical formation, precariously
poised between Marxism and Poststructuralism, one of whose unintended consequences was
to facilitate a transfer of intellectual allegiances
from the one to the other. The principal determinant of this process was political – the series
of reverses experienced by the European Left in
the 1970s, which induced a general decline in the
reputation of Marxism. However, it possessed
a theoretical rationale. For whilst Althusser’s
innovations were extremely powerful as critiques,
problematizing basic assumptions of the Marxist
tradition, they were vulnerable as solutions,
inviting countercritiques which soon ensued (see
Benton, 1984).
Thus, for example, the theory of theoretical
practice was identified as an unstable compromise
between rationalism and conventionalism, from
which the indicated escape for many was perspectivism. Anti-humanism met with both philosophical and political objections to its supposed
structural determinism (especially in Thompson,
1978), which rendered social change inconceivable and inexplicable. The theory of ideology was
convicted of functionalism and residual economism. Relative autonomy was deconstructed as
a contradiction in terms, paving the way for
“post-Marxist” pluralism.
Althusser’s attempt to answer such criticisms and
resolve some of the problems of high Althusserianism (see, for example, 1989) is generally agreed

to have foundered. And with the ascendancy of
“post-Marxism,” which often effects an antiMarxist radicalization of Althusserian theses,
his star was eclipsed, if not quite extinguished.
Nevertheless, whatever his current reputation,
Althusser can be said to possess three indubitable
historical merits (see Callinicos, in Kaplan and
Sprinker, 1993). The first is that his rereading
of the classics (re)connected Marxism with nonMarxist currents of thought (especially Lacanian
Psychoanalysis and Saussurean linguistics),
disclaiming a Marxist monopoly of social knowledge and sponsoring new departures across the
disciplinary board. Second, his philosophy for
science was a commendable endeavor to reconcile the conventionalist critique of Empiricism and
Positivism with a realist theory of the natural and
social sciences. Third, his assault upon the
Hegelian heritage in Marxism released historical
materialism from a set of false promissory notes,
analytical and political. In these respects, the
Althusserian intervention “for Marx” arguably

`Anderson, Perry (1938–) 
Marxist political
historian and theorist. One of the foremost
contemporary Marxist thinkers, Perry Anderson
has been centrally concerned with defining the
unity, limitations, and prospects (in his own
words, the “historical balance sheet”) of Western
Marxism. As editor of the New Left Review,
Anderson has spearheaded a project attempting
to remedy the deficiency, identified in his essay
“Components of a national culture” (1968), of a
tradition of Marxism in his native England. This
and other issues were to generate a sustained
polemic between E.P. Thompson and Anderson,
documented in their respective volumes The
Poverty of Theory (1978) and Arguments Within
English Marxism (1980).
Anderson has equally been concerned to investigate, from a historical materialist perspective,
both the proximate and remote antecedents of
capitalist society. His earlier works, Passages from
Antiquity to Feudalism (1974a) and Lineages of the
Absolutist State (1974b), attempt respectively to
trace two neglected historical connections: between
the classical world and feudalism, and between feudalism and the absolutist state. Passages explains
the emergence of feudalism from the “convergent
collapse” of two preceding but mutually distinct
modes of production, the slave mode which had
characterized the Greek and Roman worlds, and
the “primitive–communal” modes of the Germanic
invaders of the Roman Empire. The new feudal
mode of production was “dominated by the land
and a natural economy” and eventually produced a unified civilization which represented a
huge advance on the “patchwork communities of
the Dark Ages.” Nevertheless, Feudalism’s own
structural contradictions, such as that between “its
own rigorous tendency to a decomposition of
sovereignty and the absolute exigencies of a final
authority” contributed to its decline (Anderson,
1974a, pp. 147, 152, 183).
In Lineages, Anderson sees the absolutist state
as the “legitimate political heir” of feudalism.
The book’s compass extends over the development
of absolutism in Western and Eastern Europe,
contrasting this with the structural development
of the Ottoman Empire and Japan. Modifying
Marx’s own formulations, Anderson argues that
the “unique passage to capitalism” in Europe
was enabled by the concatenation of the ancient
and feudal modes of production, rather than

Anderson, Perry

must choose. When Milton wrote that some of
God’s servants “also serve who only stand and
wait”, are we to picture them waiting for God’s
commands, or waiting on him, as servants?
In ordinary usage and in pre-twentieth-century
literary criticism, ambiguity is usually seen as a
flaw, but in modern criticism it becomes a term
of praise. William Empson argued in Seven Types
of Ambiguity (1930), “The machinations of ambiguity are among the very roots of poetry,” and the
New Critics subsequently took up this argument
and made it a keystone of their theory.
Interest in ambiguity has recently been revived
in Deconstruction, but now with an emphasis
on the undecidable multiplicity of all linguistic
meaning rather than as a specific literary device
whose contradictions can in principle be resolved
by Empsonian analysis.

being the result of a linear transition from the
former through the latter (Anderson, 1974b,
pp. 420–2).
Perhaps Anderson’s most influential (and
controversial) works have been Considerations
on Western Marxism (1976) and its “sequel” In the
Tracks of Historical Materialism (1983). In the
former, Anderson argues that, in contrast with
the unity of theory and practice characterizing the
generation of Lenin, Trotsky, and Luxemburg,
whose theorizing was based “directly on the mass
struggles of the proletariat” (Anderson, 1976,
pp. 11, 13, 17), Western Marxism was born of
the failure of proletarian revolutions in the
advanced nations of European capitalism after
the 1914–18 war and developed an “increasing
scission between socialist theory and workingclass practice” (1976, p. 92). Theory was secluded
within the universities, its language achieving
unprecedented sophistication yet becoming increasingly specialized, pessimistic and entering
into “contradictory symbiosis” with non-Marxist
and idealist systems of thought (1976, pp. 93–4).
In contrast with this Western tradition, Anderson traces a tradition of Marxism descending from
Trotsky which, far from being academic, concentrated on politics and economics rather than
philosophy, was internationalist, and spoke a
language of “clarity and urgency” (1976, p. 100).
But above all, it was not limited by Western
Marxism’s view of official Communism as the
only incarnation of the revolutionary proletariat
(1976, p. 96). Anderson sees this alternative tradition as central to any renaissance of internationalist revolutionary Marxism (1976, p. 100).
In fact he predicts that, with the advent of a new
phase in the workers’ movement, signaled by
the French revolt of 1968 and the successes of
working-class insurgency in Britain, Italy, and
Japan in the early 1970s, Western Marxism will
fall into extinction once the divorce of theory and
practice which called it into being is itself abolished (1976, pp. 95, 101). In Tracks, Anderson sees
his prediction of the death of Western Marxism
confirmed, its traditional site, Latin Europe,
undergoing a rapid decline and being displaced
by the emergent Marxist theory in England
and America. However, he admits that his prediction of the reuniting of theory and practice
has remained unfulfilled. Arguing that Western
(Latin) Marxism has effectively been eclipsed by

Structuralism and Poststructuralism, Anderson launches his own attack on the indiscriminate, ahistorical, and socially reductive linguistic
model which constitutes the explanatory infrastructure offered by these. Anderson finally poses
the question of the relationship between Marxism,
socialism, and the process of human emancipation in general, which includes the struggle of
feminism and the nuclear disarmament lobby.
While Anderson implies the possibility of a
dialog between these various struggles, he insists
that such general emancipation cannot realize
itself without socialism at its center.
Anderson’s later collections of essays, English
Questions (1992a) and A Zone of Engagement
(1992b), continue his inquiry into the future
of socialism in an environment bloodied by
Thatcherism. He suggests that the “central case”
against capitalism lies in its breeding a combination of ecological crisis and social polarization.
The task before socialism is to realize itself in an
adequate historical agent. It must overcome its
own debilitating attachment to particular loyalties,
working instead towards international Class
solidarity motivated by universal ideals of freedom
and equality. Affiliation with the nation-state
must give way before the broader goal of a
European federation.

`androgyny 
Derived from the Greek anBr,
andros (male) and gynB (female), “androgyny”
literally refers to hermaphroditism, or the presence of both male and female reproductive organs
in a single organism. Historically, the term has
been most often used by biologists, especially
botanists discussing certain plants. However, in
the 1960s and 1970s, the concept of androgyny
became popular among feminist theorists to
describe the combination and expression of both
masculine and feminine appearances, traits,
qualities, characteristics, and virtues by human
individuals.

29
prevail over “gyn.” Radicals urged women not
to flee from femaleness and femininity, but to
emphasize and celebrate their difference from
men. Black feminists also exerted cultural pressure
to explore difference, urging greater attention to
the racial and cultural specificity of notions of gender. Feminists influenced by Deconstruction
also emphasized difference, the “difference within”
analytical categories. They claimed that, because
androgyny preserves the categories of male and
female, it can never be an alternative to the
sex–gender system, that “androgyny” is implicated
in the very dualism it seeks to undermine.
“Androgyny,” then, represents the road not
taken in feminist theory and praxis, but certain
interests of contemporary cultural critics – in
hybridity and the transgression of boundaries –
and a popular cultural movement to “gentle” or
feminize men, suggest its lingering if subterranean appeal in the late 1980s and 1990s.

`Annales historians
The journal Annales
d’histoire sociale et économique was founded in 1929
by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, who at that
time were professors of history at the University
of Strasbourg. The purpose of the journal was
to revitalize the study of history, which at the
Sorbonne had become trivialized to the point
of extinction. The founders of the journal were
determined to turn their discipline from a narrow conception of political and diplomatic history to a dynamic structural study of social and
economic history. Febvre and Bloch moved to
Paris during the 1930s, Febvre to the Collège de
France and Bloch to the Sorbonne. During the
1939–45 war Febvre worked for the Resistance;
Bloch was shot by the Germans. Even during the
occupation of France, Febvre continued work on
the journal. After the war it was given a new and
even more specific title: Annales: Economies,
sociétés, civilisations. Fernand Braudel followed
Febvre as editorial director in 1957. J.H. Hexter

Annales historians

The feminist argument for androgyny proceeded from the axiom that sex and Gender are
not identical. Sexist thinking, which is generally
both dualistic and dichotomous in its approach
to human nature, tends to conflate the two.
Sexist cultural systems first establish two categories,
“male” and “female,” then ascribe the traits by
which people are sorted into these categories,
evaluate the categories and their traits (devaluing
the female and traits associated with females), and
finally, order the categories through a variety of
cultural moves (such as situation, standardization,
and distribution of perspectivity), ultimately to
enforce relations of dominance and subordination
between human beings classified as male and
female (Messer-Davidow, 1987, pp. 81–3). Since
sexism is only possible when human beings are
able to distinguish between males and females of
the species, human beings in sexist societies are
prohibited from appearing to belong to the other
sex, to neither sex, or to both sexes. Since the psychological and cultural reproduction of sexism
is only possible when males and females are prohibited from performing the work or expressing
the qualities associated with the other sex, appropriate gender behavior is rigorously enforced.
Feminists claimed that the practice of androgyny
would promote human freedom by asserting the
right of individuals to develop according to their
own innate logic, not one imposed by sexist culture; it would expose the social constructedness
of gender and thus expose sites for the reconstruction of a genderless society; and finally, androgyny would attack sexism directly and effectively
by undermining its foundation, the differentiation of human beings into male and female
sex-classes.
Before the 1960s and 1970s, feminists explored
androgyny only occasionally, such as when Elizabeth Cady Stanton asserted that the deity was
androgynous in The Woman’s Bible (1895) and
Virginia Woolf prescribed in A Room of One’s
Own (1928) that writers be either “man-womanly”
or “woman-manly.” The fullest articulation of
androgyny as a feminist popular cultural ideal
is Carolyn Heilbrun’s Toward a Recognition of
Androgyny (1973). Interest in androgyny diminished by the 1980s, which might be called the
“decade of difference.” Radical feminists claimed
that, in a male-dominated society, androgyny
could never be realized, that “andro” would always

`anxiety of influence 
A term in literary
theory, used especially by Harold Bloom to refer
to a consequence of the impact of responsive
reading on “strong” poets or readers. When a
strong poet or reader, such as William Blake,
registers the full impact of a precursor’s work,
Milton’s Paradise Lost for example, the initial
response is to feel genuinely overwhelmed by the
earlier poet’s achievement and momentarily to
believe that nothing more is possible in the
mode of such achievement, such as English epic
Poetry. This state of anxiety of influence may
make the later poet experience a condition of
imaginative claustrophobia, or a sense of the
exhaustion of imaginative opportunity by what
has been previously written. Rather than being
defeated by such a sense, a strong poet sets about
the task of interpretatively reducing the predecessor’s work by an act of willful misprision,
thus claiming, as Blake did, that Milton was in
chains when he wrote of God but free when he
wrote of Satan, because he was a true poet and
unconsciously of the Devil’s party. Such productive Misreading opens up the possibility of new
creative activity in the reclaimed imaginative
space. Although Bloom develops his theory on the
basis of meticulous commentary on the practices
of English Romantic poets – initially Shelley and
Blake – it roughly parallels Derrida’s independent theory of Deconstruction. Although in its
early formulation (Bloom, 1973), the anxiety of
influence was a theory of post-Miltonic literary
history that did not extend back to Shakespeare,
it soon became a model for all literary history, at
least since biblical times (Bloom, 1975a). As
such, Bloom’s anxiety of influence may be read
as a productive response to Kabbalistic readings
of the Bible, Nietzsche’s theories of reading in
Ecce Homo, and Freud’s theory of the agon
characteristic of the Oedipal phase of human
development.

`aporia 
A term from ancient philosophy denoting a problem which is difficult to solve owing to
some Contradiction either in the object itself
or in the concept of it. Aristotle defined it as
“equality between contrary deductions.” It has
enjoyed a revival in post-Hegelian thought
because it registers the objectivity of contradiction without the implication of a prospective
dialectical “overcoming”.

analysis associated with the work of Michel
Foucault and concerned with transformations
in the field of knowledge. An alternative history
of thought which places emphasis on analysis of
the rules of formation through which groups of
statements achieve a unity as a science, a theory,
or a Text. The focus of analysis is on Discursive practices and relations.

A term central to Jungian psychology, which derives from the Greek arche, meaning “primal,” and typos, meaning “imprint, stamp,
pattern.” The tendency to apprehend and experience life in a fashion conditioned by the past
history of (wo)mankind Jung terms archetypal,
and archetypes are the “a priori, inborn forms
of ‘intuition’ ” (Collected Works, Vol. 8, p. 133).
Nevertheless, archetypes are unconscious and
exist only in potentia; they must be beckoned
forth by circumstance, and different ones operate
in different lives. Perhaps the phrase “a priori

A term associated with Michel
Foucault’s archaeological analysis of forms of
thought. The archive is “the general system of the
formation and transformation of statements”
(1974, p. 130) which exists during a given period
within a particular society. It refers to the rules
of Discursive practice through which past
statements achieved both their enunciability as
events and functioning as things. For Foucault the
archive comprises “Discourses that have just
ceased to be ours,” and its analysis serves to
establish “that we are difference, that our reason
is the difference of discourses, our history the
difference of times, our selves the difference of
masks” (ibid., p. 131).

`Arendt, Hannah (1906–75) 
Political thinker. Arendt is notable, not least, for her radical
critique of the whole tradition of political philosophy on the grounds that philosophy, as a
contemplative discipline, intrinsically tends to
inhibit any genuine feel for politics.
Although by nature a contemplative thinker herself, her life experience taught her to mistrust pure
contemplation. Even so, she was equally averse
to political orthodoxies. Thus, having originated
from a thoroughly assimilated German Jewish
background, she nevertheless chose to celebrate
– as the purest antithesis to the socially ambitious
“parvenu” – the vocation of the politically conscious “pariah.”

Arendt, Hannah

categories of possible functioning” best captures
the Jungian essence of the term (Collected Works,
Vol. 16, p. 34). The archetypes are experienced
as emotions as well as images (often in dreams),
and their effect is especially salient in typical and
significant milestones such as birth and death,
triumph over natural obstacles, transitional stages
of life like adolescence, extreme danger, or aweinspiring experiences. As a result of his study of
dreams, mythologies, legends, religions, and
alchemy, Jung came to classify two broad categories
of archetypes. First, there are the personifying
archetypes, which take on a human-like identity
when they function in the psyche. For example,
the anima in man and its counterpart in woman,
the animus, are convenient designations for any
number of interpersonal situations between the
sexes. Thus, the anima represents all of man’s
ancestral experiences with woman and the animus
all of woman’s ancestral experiences with man.
Secondly, there are the transforming archetypes,
which are not necessarily personalities, but
include typical situations, geometric figures,
places, and other means that emerge when the
personality is moving toward change, and particularly that balancing sort of transformation
which will result in the experience of “wholeness”
or “totality,” the archetype of the self. The main
archetypes of transformation discussed by Jung
are the mandala, a Sanskrit word meaning magic
circle, whose symbolism includes all concentrically
arranged figures, all radial or spherical arrangements, and all circles or squares with a central
point (for example, the wheel, eyes, flowers, the
sun, a star, snakes holding their tails); and the quaternity, which has to do with geometrical figures
being divisible by four, having four sides, or four
directions. Mandala and quaternity Symbols are
often brought together, for instance, in the
flower symbol (petals focusing our attention on
the pistil), the wheel symbol (spokes focusing
attention on the hub), but the most frequent
symbol for the mandala is the cross (focusing
attention on the union of the four-sided structure).
Jung states: “It is no use at all to learn a list of
archetypes by heart. Archetypes are complexes of
experience that come upon us like fate, and their
effects are felt in our most personal life”
(Collected Works, Vol. 9. i, p. 30).

Gustav.

Her only direct participation in organized
politics came during the period 1933–42, when
she was active in the Zionist movement. This led
her into exile, first in Paris, and then from 1941
in New York (where, ten years later, she became
an American citizen). She had been a student
of Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers, and in
1929 had published her doctoral dissertation,
“Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin.” The first of her
major works, however, is her monumental study
of The Origins of Totalitarianism, which appeared
in 1951. Thereafter all her writings, although they
take various forms, may be seen as following a
consistent trajectory. The Origins of Totalitarianism
has been criticized for its lopsidedness: by
“totalitarianism” she means what Nazism had in
common with Stalinism, but most of the book
is concerned with the prehistory specifically of
Nazism. Her original intention therefore was
to supplement it with a critique of Marx, and
Marxist tradition. What this eventually turned into,
however, was The Human Condition – a systematic phenomenological study of the vita activa.
Here, her critique of Marx is placed within the
broader context of a general polemic against the
prevailing modern subordination of politics to
an ethos deriving from the experience of “labor,”
and is supplemented by a parallel attack on the
reduction of politics to a mode of “work.” By
“labor” she means what we do to meet the most
basic demands of living, and the corresponding
ethos is one designed to maximize production
and consumption. “Work” is what we do to construct a stable world in which to live. Philosophers naturally tend to idealize political stability
as an optimum environment for their way of life.
But true political wisdom, she suggests, lies rather
in a proper appreciation of “action”: public performance, as such. Inasmuch as totalitarianism
seeks to minimize the space for this, the lesson
of the nightmare is that we should learn to love
that space – for its own sake.
In The Human Condition she celebrates what
Plato devalues, the public Culture of ancient
Athens, as one embodiment of such wisdom;
whilst in the works that follow, Between Past and
Future, On Revolution, and Crises of the Republic,
she traces its reappearance also in the initial ferment of modern revolutions, before they were
hijacked by political parties, and in the student
movement of the 1960s.

Arendt is not only an analyst of the vita activa,
though. In her final, unfinished work, The Life of
the Mind, she turns to the vita contemplativa.
This stems from what she had observed in 1961
at the trial of the Nazi, Adolf Eichmann, for genocide. Her initial report, Eichmann in Jerusalem,
caused a furore, because of her (incidental) criticisms of the Jewish community leadership,
although its major theme is captured in the subtitle: “A report on the banality of evil.” Above all,
she insists, Eichmann’s crimes derived from his
radical incapacity to think, will, or judge for
himself – and she therefore sets out systematically
to consider the ethical dimensions of these three
activities. (Sadly, she managed to complete only
the first two volumes, Thinking and Willing.)

Culture and Anarchy (1869) and other works he
campaigned in gracefully ironic fashion against

the best ideas), also predicting that dogmatic
religion would be replaced with poetry as the

art What is art? The working definition of art
to be discussed here is that art is the subject of

33
more than 300 works that represent a vast range
in materials and techniques, form and content,
function and aim. Another reason for saying
there is no such thing as Art is to point out to
the reader that most of the works presented were
made in response to specific purposes and particular occasions, and were not meant to be
taken from this context and exhibited in a
museum (or reproduced in a book) as Art.
Gombrich’s discussion restores to the works the
context from which they emerged, describing,
for example, the belief in magically insuring success in hunting that prompted the cave painting,
and the sight of Italian peasants on farm horses
fleeting the shelling of their villages during the
1939–45 war that brought about Marini’s sculpture. However, perhaps the main reason for
Gombrich to say that there is no such thing as
Art is to prevent his readers from bringing with
them predetermined expectations about how
works should look. Gombrich’s book encourages
readers to be open to the various languages to be
found in works from the past – from the classical beauty of Melozzo Da Forli’s angels to the
primitive strength of a Tuscan Master’s crucified
Christ. There are two expectations that readers
might cling to about the appearance of works
that Gombrich singles out for special attention.
To the first of these – that works appear real –
Gombrich suggests that the summary treatment
in Rembrandt’s charcoal drawing of an elephant
is as convincing a statement as the detailed treatment in Dürer’s watercolor of a hare. To the
second – that works be like those with which the
viewer is already familiar and comfortable –
Gombrich points out that the honesty of Caravaggio’s first and rejected version of The Inspiration
of St Matthew may be preferable to the conventionality of his second and accepted version.
By saying at the outset that there is no such thing
as Art, Gombrich gives the readers the opportunity to view with unprejudiced eyes the different
responses that works show to different ideas and
beliefs. But Gombrich also provides guidance for
the readers as to the limits of the differences. For
while Gombrich says there is no such thing as Art,
he says that there are artists – individuals who give
special care to thinking about and working on their
responses in the work that they do. On a modest
level, Gombrich says, we are able to recognize the
artist because all of us from time to time have been

art historical writings, and specifically art is the
subject of (i) Ernst Gombrich’s The Story of
Art, 1950 (1995) and (ii) Mieke Bal’s Reading
“Rembrandt”: Beyond the Word–Image Opposition
(1991). Gombrich’s The Story of Art and Bal’s
Reading “Rembrandt” are used here because they
occupy such distinct places along one spectrum
of art historical Writings. Gombrich’s is certainly
the most widely read and possibly the most generally acclaimed book associated with traditional
art history, and Bal’s is one of the most sharply
focused and carefully reasoned books employing
and developing ideas on what has been termed
new art history. The books are also distinctive
because they are directed at different levels of
readership. Gombrich’s is an introductory Text
intended for the reader new to the study of art,
while Bal’s requires a reader/viewer who has
experience in the study of art. But here Bal’s
book will be viewed as another introduction – or
more precisely, as another idea of what art is.
Gombrich’s The Story of Art and Bal’s Reading
“Rembrandt” are widely divergent in their views
of art, but taken together (though the discussion
of their writings here does not approach, much
less combine, the clarity of Gombrich’s thought
and the subtlety of Bal’s ideas, which is to be discovered in these books themselves) they offer a
broad basis for a discussion of what art is.
Ernst Gombrich begins his survey of the history of art, The Story of Art, by saying that there
is no such thing as Art. (It may be helpful to point
out now that the word “art” is used in three ways
by Gombrich. When Art is spelled with a capital
“A,” he is referring to a universal aesthetic component in works, which for him is usually discussed
with a combination of pomposity and vagueness. When Art is spelled with a lower-case “a,”
he means either routine image making – that is,
works which would be of interest as artifacts,
such as popular art and children’s art – or he
means what can be characterized as fine art – that
is, those works which are the proper subject of
art history.) One reason for saying that there is
no such thing as Art is to prepare the young
readers for whom the book is intended for the great

concerned with making something look just right,
even if it was only the simple task of arranging
flowers in a vase. The difference between this
modest artist in us all and the artists discussed in
art history is that those artists devote most of their
time to such work and thought, and the best of
them are willing to make great sacrifices for what
they think and do. There is a sameness in the
different works discussed by Gombrich as fine art,
which is that they express deeply held values in
a way that, no matter how much effort has gone
into their creation, conveys a sense of effortless
harmony. Three specific sign posts are set up
by Gombrich to further define the limits of the
works that will be encountered by the readers –
one “go” sign and two “stop” signs. First, the wellknown masterpieces (such as works by Leonardo
da Vinci and Rembrandt) will be discussed because
they exemplify supreme efforts in the expression
of human values and in the appearance of visual
harmony; second, works that follow fashion
and popular taste (such as Pop art) are not to
be included because they reflect passing rather than
permanent values; and third, works that mock
sincere works (such as dada art) are excluded
because they do not deserve to be either seriously
discussed or (like pop art) to be included alongside the work of masters such as Leonardo da Vinci
and Rembrandt.
The statement that there is no such thing as Art
coupled with the statement that there are artists
make explicit in Gombrich’s book what is implicit
in all introductory histories of art – that is, that
art is defined in its historical context, and by
providing an idea of this context the historian can
offer an understanding of what art is. As the title
– story rather than history of art – conveys,
Gombrich’s book is not to be understood simply
as a chronological record, but also as a planned
narrative in which the works discussed are selected
as one might choose characters for the telling of
a tale. This is not to say that other histories of
art are less a story than Gombrich’s, but only
that Gombrich’s history does not pretend a pure
objectivity about what art is. The principal characters of Gombrich’s narrative are master works
by master artists, which serve as the primary
guidelines in marking out the territory of art
over the course of its history. And the primary plot
in his narrative is to provide an idea of the
artist’s intentions and the social and cultural

conditions of the periods in which these artists
lived. An example (if one is needed) is the work
of Rembrandt, “one of the greatest painters who
ever lived” and “the greatest painter of Holland”
where, in the seventeenth century, Protestantism
was victorious and where there was a stiff and
bracing competition among artists for the attention of the middle-class picture-buying public.
Specifically, a late self-portrait by Rembrandt is
discussed as an example of what belongs in the
history of art. It is art not because this work
corresponds to some prevailing idea of Beauty,
but because in it Rembrandt portrays himself
with total honesty, adding a new dimension of
psychic reality to the physical reality that has been
achieved in the portraiture of earlier masters,
such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.
The idea of what art is, into which the reader
is initiated by Gombrich’s The Story of Art, is
viewed as being a severely limited one in the
recent writing of a number of art historians and
those from other areas of study who write about
art. In this writing, which includes Mieke Bal’s
Reading “Rembrandt”: Beyond the Word–Image
Opposition, the kind of art history found in
Gombrich’s narrative is viewed as elitist, sexist,
racist, Eurocentric, and one that focuses too
exclusively on works selected with a theory of progressive development of representation in mind.
The basic objection to Gombrich’s narrative that
lies behind these views is to the subjectivity of its
method, which informs the works discussed by the
point of view of the historian. But the objection
is aimed less at the methodology of traditional art
history than at the definition that methodology
forces on art. Of the three specific guidelines cited
by Gombrich to set the limits on what works are
to be included and excluded in Reading “Rembrandt,” the first two of these (the use of masterpieces as primary landmarks in the history of art,
and the exclusion of popular art from the history
of fine art) are directly contradicted; the third (the
refusal to treat art that is anti-art as fine art) is
indirectly, but perhaps more fundamentally,
called into question. Beginning with the third,
Gombrich sees the work of Marcel Duchamp, such
as the ready-made urinal entitled Fountain, and
the “serious” writing about it as redefining art,
as “trivialities.” A work such as Duchamp’s
L.H.O.O.Q. is also an insult to traditional art
history. The title, mustache, and goatee are a

35
issue), but rather in bringing Popular culture
to bear on “Rembrandt.” Analogous to Duchamp’s
commentary on Leonardo da Vinci by using a
reproduction of Mona Lisa in his L.H.O.O.Q.
(which itself in turn is re-reproduced for further
consumption), Bal deflates the concept of master artist and at the same time causes to collapse
the hierarchy separating high and popular art.
Bal’s reading of Rembrandt’s self-portraits
may serve as a specific example of what view of
art is taken in recent Cultural studies. Bal
chooses an early, small self-portrait of the artist
in his studio by “Rembrandt” as the focus of her
discussion, rather than what might be considered
a “major,” “mature,” or “characteristic” work by
the artist. Her analysis reacts against the realism
of the self-portrait to concentrate on its constructedness, so rather than viewing it in its sequential relationship to Renaissance portraiture, as
Gombrich does, Bal examines it in tandem with
Velázquez’s Maids of Honor. Unlike Gombrich,
who approaches the self-portrait by Rembrandt
as a whole experience to suggest its basic and summary impact, for Bal it is frequently the small detail
in a work (such as the palette hanging on the back
wall in the “Rembrandt” self-portrait which is positioned like and functions as the mirror on the back
wall in Velasquez’s work) that is an index to a
specific and often overlooked text in the work. The
dialectic between artist as humble craftsman
and artist as proud creator that can be seen in
both “Rembrandt”’s and Velasquez’s paintings
of themselves in working situations reflects on the
viewer of these paintings because of the presence
of an implied or actual mirror. The question,
“Where is the viewer positioned?,” raised in the
Velasquez painting by the mirror and the narrativity found in the other figures present has been
the subject of much art historical/critical writing.
With an intertextual reading of the early “Rembrandt” self-portrait (in which, even though the
figure of the artist is still and alone, a narrativity
may be discovered by the viewer’s own work) and
Velasquez’s Maids of Honor, Bal is able to discern
and describe different kinds of self-reflectedness
in the writing about the Velasquez painting, unintended but no less real self-portraits of art historians and critics at work. In their discussions
of Rembrandt’s and “Rembrandt”’s self-portraits,
Gombrich aims at making the viewer aware of
what Rembrandt has achieved, while Bal’s aim is

art

commentary (surely an adolescent one for Gombrich) on Leonardo da Vinci’s work along the lines
of Walter Pater’s well-known description of
Mona Lisa as “older than the rocks among which
she sits” (the facial hair applied by Duchamp does
age Mona Lisa somewhat), which Gombrich finds
“blatantly subjective.” However, Gombrich’s own
comment on Mona Lisa that she “looks alive” and
“seems to change before our eyes” is different only
in degree (though the degree for Gombrich is
critical), not kind, from Pater’s and Duchamp’s.
With the use of image (the hair and reproduction)
and words (the title) Duchamp’s mustached
Mona Lisa is a kind of visual/verbal art history that
parodies and caricatures traditional art history
while it assaults fine art ideals.
Duchamp’s L.H.O.O.Q. also can be taken to be,
then, an emblem of the cultural history of Bal’s
Reading “Rembrandt”: Beyond the Word–Image
Opposition – not for what it is not in this case,
but for what it is. First, in the spirit of Duchamp,
a basic goal of Bal’s study is to seek out connections between the verbal and the visual, examining the constant interactions between reading
and viewing in cultural experience. Also, Bal
finds that historical study is shaped and shaded
by the background and standards of its writers that
are projected on the material of the study. This
is particularly true not only if the text of the
study is art, which invites subjective reading,
but also if the text of the study is the social context in which the art is enmeshed, because this
entailed selection and interpretation that is subject to the presence of the writers. Additionally,
like Duchamp in L.H.O.O.Q., Bal in Reading
“Rembrandt” raises the question of the validity of
the master work by master artist approach to the
understanding of the experience of art. While
Bal chooses Rembrandt as the primary visual text
in her study because he is a master artist responsible for what is seen as being “High art,” her
view of Rembrandt focuses on how that lofty
positioning contributes to the response that his
work elicits on issues that are of concern in contemporary Western Culture at large. Her interest lies not in Rembrandt as artistic genius (thus,
one reason Rembrandt’s name is put in quotation
marks by Bal is because the question of whether
one is dealing with works that can be attributed
with certainty to his hand or not – a question for
the elitist interests of connoisseurship – is not at

36
to make the viewer/reader aware of how viewing and reading can interact, has interacted,
and does interact with the accomplishments of
“Rembrandt”.
In her reading of “Rembrandt”, Mieke Bal has
followed the advice given by Ernst Gombrich
in the Story of Art, looking at pictures with fresh
eyes and embarking on a voyage of discovery.
Although Gombrich would not agree with everything that she has brought back from her journey, he and Bal start their journeys from the
same place, travel side by side through important
places along the way, and journey in the same
direction. Gombrich and Bal both begin by
knowing that, while there are artists, there is no
such thing as Art. They agree about the importance of being attentive to the social situations in
which artists work, and about the significant role
that the subjectivity of historians plays in their
discussions of those situations and those works.
Further, they agree on the profound transforming effect that verbal discussions, including their
own, have on visual images. Just as visitors to art
museums easily can find themselves being drawn
toward the labels beside the pictures and away
from the pictures themselves, so too the discussion of pictures in art history and cultural history,
like grossly extended labels, can obscure the pictures it is meant to bring closer to the viewer.
Finally, Gombrich and Bal both understand the
powerful effect that the work of art can have
on its viewers, and both, in writing down their
observations, thoughts, and beliefs from their
own journeys in search of the sources of this
power, have guided others in the continual discovery of what art is.

`art worlds 
Term developed by the sociologist,
Howard S. Becker. For Becker, art entails the
“joint activity” of a number of people, and an
art work always shows “Signs of that coopera-

tion” (1974). Art worlds, then, “consist of all the
people whose activities are necessary to the production of the characteristic works which that
world, and perhaps others as well, define as art”
(1982, p. 34) Art worlds do not only produce
works of art but also give them their aesthetic
value.

`Auerbach, Erich (1892–1957) 
Philologist.
Author of the landmark critical work Mimesis,
Auerbach wrote extensively on Italian, French, and
medieval Latin literature, the literary influences
of Christian symbolism, and methods of historical criticism.
The product of an eclectic academic background
in Germany, where he studied art history, law, and
philology, Auerbach, as a leading philologist of
Romance languages and literatures, established a
metaphysical/historical interpretative perspective
which constituted a new epistemological approach
to historical Literary criticism.
Discharged as professor of Romance philology
at Marburg University by the Nazi regime in 1935,
Auerbach spent the next 12 years in Istanbul,
where his work became both driven and informed
by a desire to define and, if possible, preserve
Western literary and cultural traditions and values.
The recurring framing device characterizing his
work was the analysis of literary language and
themes as a method of historical interpretation.
The subject of Auerbach’s most important
work, Mimesis (subtitled The Representation of
Reality in Western Literature), was not so much
realism in general as much as the manner in
which realistic subjects were treated seriously,
problematically, or tragically throughout the history of the development of European literature.
In this respect – especially in light of Auerbach’s
methodology of isolating what he referred to as
“levels of style” derived from textual interpretations unfettered by historical critical convention

`Austin, John Langshaw (1911–60) 
Philosopher born in Lancaster, England, educated at
Oxford University and a fellow of All Souls
College (1933–5) and Magdalen College (1935–
52). He was elected to the White’s Professor of
Moral Philosophy Chair at Oxford in 1952 and
held the position until his death. He wrote little
and published less (seven articles during his life),
yet his name was for decades synonymous with
a philosophical approach that emphasized careful attention to ordinary language use, sometimes
simply called Oxford philosophy.
Austin took pride in being a teacher and a
university professor. He believed, however, that
philosophy should be more than traditional academic lecturing and writing. Philosophy was for
him something in which to engage, in which to
participate actively. It should be a joint undertaking, not a solitary one; it is best done in
groups as a cooperative enterprise. Philosophical
inquiry, Austin believed, should include careful
discussions with others about clearly set topics and
have definitive goals.
Even though he stressed the cooperative and
shared nature of philosophy, Austin had the reputation of being a terrifying person and made
many an enemy at Oxford. His work was often

dismissed as limited and unphilosophical. His use
of philosophy was considered trivial by Bertrand
Russell and nothing but extremely narrow wordplay by A.J. Ayer. Such sentiments are still to be
found in discussions of Austin’s philosophy,
with it often being dismissed on the grounds
that it simply represents overly refined Oxford
tastes and an exaggerated preoccupation with
language.
While there is no denying a specific focus to
his mature work, a careful reading of his papers
and lectures reveals an amazing breadth of interest. A sizable, though subtly used, number of
literary, scientific, legal, and philosophical quotations and references populate his Texts. Even
Austin’s early lectures and papers belie criticisms
of triviality and narrowness. As a young man he
made a very careful study of the philosophy of
Leibniz, and closely examined Greek philosophy,
especially Aristotle’s ethical works and Plato’s
Republic. He also translated Frege’s Foundations
of Arithmetic (published 1950). As his thought
developed, he found himself reinterpreting philosophy in concerns and methods reminiscent
of Socrates, and his interest in language was not
separable from his interest in the nature of the
world and the human character. Austin’s interest
in language was pursued with rigor, tenaciousness,
and patience with the aim of achieving clarity
and improvement of thought. Such qualities are
well represented in his most notable (1946) article
“Other minds” (Austin, 1979, pp. 76–116).
Much of the difficulty in appreciating Austin
is due to his general refusal to provide comprehensive theses and conclusions to his work; and
although repeated themes can easily be found
(philosopher’s fixation with a few words, the danger of oversimplified conclusions, lack of careful
and correct descriptions, repeated phrases and halfstudied facts, obsessive repetition of the same small
range of tired examples), there is no grounding
of his observations and assertions in a set of
simple and unifying principles. Nevertheless,
such a supposed lack is an important ingredient
of his way of working. Each inquiry in which he
engaged has an independence from others, and
no one study or set of data or result is to serve
as the basis or framework for other inquiries. We
are to investigate our ordinary uses of language
without the dogmatic restrictions of general
principles and theories developed from other

which followed him.

studies. If there is a single truth Austin thinks he
finds in his many inquiries, it is that our ordinary
words are much subtler in their use, and there
are many more possible uses and distinctions of
language than philosophers have realized. There
is a complexity, specificity, and nontheoretical,
many-voiced character to Austin’s work that
must not be missed in attempts to categorize and
understand it.
While some philosophers find the study of
ordinary language of little use, Austin felt that such
attention can give philosophy a clear task and
subject-matter. Its aim and goal might be as grand
as finding ourselves and others in our language;
or as simple (Austin’s preference) as exposing
distinctions, complexities, and subtleties of language we had not known or had not heeded.
Whatever one’s judgment about his procedures,
Austin was convinced that his approach was
productive for it afforded him “what philosophy
is so often thought, and made, barren of – the fun
of discovery, the pleasures of co-operation, and
the satisfaction of reaching agreement” (“A plea
for excuses,” 1956, reprinted in Austin, 1979,
p. 175).
Several of Austin’s students have tried to
recreate his method of work so that others, in
Austin’s absence, could understand and possibly
use it; and so that others might better appreciate
his written works, which were derived from
these procedures. The most elaborate such discussion is found in J.O. Urmson’s article entitled
“J.L. Austin” (Urmson, 1965). That presentation
has been enhanced by the written discussions
of others and by the recreation of several Austin
lectures and sets of teaching notes that have been
published posthumously. (The most notable is
Sense and Sensibilia, 1962.) Essentially the method
of inquiry, which Austin – somewhat hesitatingly – called “linguistic phenomenology,” comprises the following steps:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

Choose an area of Discourse.
Collect the complete vocabulary of this
area.
Provide examples of use and misuse of
the collected data.
Attempt to give general accounts of the
various expressions under consideration.
Compare the accounts given with what
philosophers have said.

(vi)
(vii)

Examine traditional philosophical arguments in light of results.
Return to number (i).

Austin thought of his method as an empirical
inquiry necessitating the efforts of many. It was
best employed by using a team of a dozen or
so individuals working closely together. It was
to provide a nondogmatic method of discovery
rather than a theory of explanation. The method
would show its worth and justification, like
any laboratory technique, by its success in
practice.
There is some value in such an organized view
of Austin’s method of inquiry, for if nothing else
it provides insight into how his papers came to
be written and why they have the form they do.
Nonetheless such a presentation must be accompanied by several warnings (Cavell, 1965). Austin
is not doing descriptive linguistics, for he intends
to look as much at the world as at language in
his procedures; he does not remain satisfied with
describing what people say but also wants to know
why people speak as they do; he is not revealing
social conventions but seeking truths about the
human condition; he is not giving priority to the
speech of others but is interested in understanding where and why one does use, or hesitates to
use, or feels uncomfortable in using particular
words and expressions. (“Why do I feel this
way?” tends to be a question at the centre of the
method.) For all of its stress on empirical discovery
and cooperative work, it must be said that advantageous and productive use of Austin’s method
requires a self-reflective intelligence and a lively
imagination. Some have even said that the method
was only of use to someone like Austin who had
the scholarly patience and artistic creativity to make
it work.
Austin’s work uncovered the way language and
action are intertwined, and much of his reputation still rests on his discussion of performative
utterances (for example, promising, warning,
apologizing); on the way that saying something
entails doing something; on the way many things
are created when we say something. An important question that Austin could not shy away
from was “can saying make it so?” (How To Do
Things with Words, 1981, pp. 7ff ). This question
sounds strange and we clearly are tempted to say
no. However, Austin’s work on performative

39
explored ways in which the author’s I might be
written as itself a text (the “person” taken apart
in writing, removed from all assertion of some
expressive unity of “self”).
While reiterating some of Barthes’s emphases,
Michel Foucault’s “What is an author?” (1969)
proposed the study of a historically variable
“author-function” characterizing the existence
and circulation of certain Discourses within
a society. Such a study leads to questions of
authorization – who may figure as an author,
which texts have authority, how are discourses
“owned”? – that the dissolution of authorship
into textuality can too easily avoid.

`avant-garde
This term, taken from French
military usage designating the select corps which
went out in advance of the main body of troops,
is applied to the political and the cultural spheres
(particularly the visual arts) to describe those
individuals or groups whose ideas and work seem
ahead of the times. The concept of an avantgarde functioned as a primary stratagem in the
description of modern art, which was seen as a
battleground where certain artists thrust toward
new territory while conservative forces held fast
to tradition. Surveys of modern art start at different times, but those written prior to the 1980s
begin in the same place – with the notion of an
artistic revolution against the established order led
by an avant-garde. For John Canady, Mainstreams
of Modern Art (1959), modernism begins with
Jacques-Louis David, whose life and art are presented as part of the violent break that the
French Revolution makes with the aristocratic
tradition of the rococo. The pattern that Canady
then describes is revolution followed by counterrevolution of the next avant-garde, with new
forward positions continually being established in
art throughout the nineteenth and twentieth

`author, death of 
A theme in Poststructuralism decisively stated in Roland Barthes’s
“The death of the author” (1967). Barthes identified a cultural investment in the author as
explanatory source of Texts: the idea of the
author-as-God originating meaning, against which
he stressed the linguistic reality of the author –
created only in language – and the plurality of any
text – space of the interaction of a number of
Writings. Recognition of this is the condition of
a modern literary practice (Barthes cites Mallarmé’s
desire to yield the initiative to words). The death
of the author brings the liberation of the reader,
no longer constrained to the authorial fiction
of the single voice in mastery of its text. Subsequently, Barthes envisaged a possible “amicable” return of the author (made up in reading as
a novelistic figure, a set of textual “charms”) and

utterances suggests that it is not as odd a query
as might first appear. Saying something is not an
isolated act but requires the appropriate fabric and
circumstances of life to be meaningful and have
the force it possesses. Hence being able to say
something is closely related to the nature of
things, and Austin, in this regard, stresses the need
to consider the total Speech-act situation. In our
examination of ordinary language, we study not
simply a word or a sentence, but the breathing
of, the issuing of, the very life of an utterance. Like
Wittgenstein, Austin’s appeal to ordinary language is made to emphasize that what we say is
said meaningfully in a definite context and is
said by humans to humans – hence the obsession
not with words or sentences, but with the use and
life of language. The ordinariness of an expression is less important than the fact that an
expression is said (written) by human beings, in
a language they share. For Austin, there is nothing wrong with using technical or special terminology, and ordinary language is not to be
treated as sacred. Nevertheless, he insisted that we
must be clear about the language we use and the
ways we use it.

centuries, from neoclassicism to abstract expressionism. At the time when the abstract expressionist avant-garde began to be eclipsed by the next
avant-garde, Harold Rosenberg sees a new historical pattern developing: the breaking with
tradition becoming its own tradition, that is, the
tradition of the new (1959). As E.H. Gombrich
points out (1971), adopting this pattern of progress to tell the story of modern art, seeing each
new generation of artists pushing the frontiers of
art into a new territory, results in the perceived
difference between antiquated and advanced art
obscuring a real distinction between the serious
and the frivolous in art. So for Gombrich, the
anti-art of Marcel Duchamp and Dada, which
exemplifies the frivolous misread as the serious,
might have functioned to call attention to the
pompousness of the notion of progress in art, if
it was not itself mistaken for avant-garde. Clement
Greenberg, who felt that avant-garde art was
the only protection against the evils of Kitsch
(popular art for the masses) saw the seemingly
difficult art of Duchamp and Dada as a pseudoavant-garde art (later termed avant-gardes by
Greenberg) that threatened authentic avantgarde art (1971). Hilton Kramer believed that the
acceptance and popular recognition of abstract
expressionism (itself becoming a form of Kitsch)
marked the end of the avant-garde pattern in
modernism (1973). T.J. Clark, in writing about
Gustave Courbet, cautions his readers not to
view avant-garde as a monolithic force, but to see
it as a secret and unstable action, more akin, one
imagines, to a CIA operation than a military
maneuver (1973 (1984)). Added to these views,
which held that avant-garde patterns had
changed, or ended altogether, or were not what
they had been thought to be, was the view that
the avant-garde had never existed in the first
place. The shift in the perception of the avant-garde
in modernism – from being a functioning principle of artistic development to being a complete
fiction – was brought about by many factors.
Among them are included: the shrinking of the
time-lag between the creation of the avant-garde
work and its acceptance by the art audience; the
disbelief in artistic revolution as causing social
change; the disgust at the shameless marketing
of “new and improved” art; the distaste for the
war imagery built into the term “avant-garde”; the

dismay at the picture within the vanguard pattern
of modernism that presented important artistic
creation as essentially a white male activity; and
the discovery in postmodern art of the deconstruction of the avant-garde. A modernism very
different from that in Canady’s book is described
by Robert Hughes in The Shock of the New (1980
(1991)), because of the changed view of the
avant-garde. Hughes does not see modern art
as a series of successful revolutions, but as a set
of ambitious, sometimes empty, though basically failed dreams. For Hughes the notion of an
avant-garde becomes suspect primarily because
of the abuse of the concept in the aesthetic
ideology of the United States, which was based,
he believed, on a shallow educational system,
crass commercialism, addiction to change for its
own sake, and an obsession with current fashion
and fad. Rosalind Krauss argues that the various
avant-gardes have in common a belief in the
essential originality of their art. However, for
Krauss, the strategy of appropriation in postmodern art reveals that repetition and recurrence play a part equally essential to that of
originality in artistic creation, though their
role is hidden by the discourse of originality
(engaged in by galleries and museums, art critics
and historians, and artists themselves) on which
the existence of the avant-garde depends. Thus
the pictures by Sherrie Levine, which are photographs of the photographs of Edward Weston
and Eliot Porter (whose photographs are in
turn based on models by other artists), disclose
the fiction of pure originality and along with
it expose the myth of the avant-garde (1981
(1985)). Donald Kuspit contends in The Cult
of the Avant-Garde Artist (1993) that the appropriations of Levine not only deconstruct the
original works that they copy, but also dismember them, stripping originality of its meaning.
However, in the process of emasculating the
works of Weston and Porter, Kuspit sees Levine’s
copies as also acknowledging the potency of the
originals, and thus her appropriations reaffirm
the avant-garde of the past. For Kuspit, then,
postmodernism not only marks the end of the
avant-garde, but is also the beginning of a neoavant-garde art, a decadent mannerism that
castrates, but at the same time authenticates, the
avant-garde.

scientist, philosopher, and literary theorist. Among
the most comprehensive and sophisticated French
thinkers of the twentieth century, Bachelard first
completed his studies in mathematics and physics
and was especially influenced by the scientific
thinking of Einstein and Heisenberg and their
respective theories of relativity and indeterminacy.
Immediately following his scientific studies, Bachelard began to explore philosophy as a necessary
complement to the evolution of thought that he
recognized occurring in contemporary science. He
then commenced teaching at the University of
Dijon (1930–40), where he lectured on mathematics and physics and pursued his scientific
writings, which are best represented by his book
The New Scientific Spirit (1934). Increasingly concerned with the philosophy of science, he was subsequently invited to the Sorbonne as professor of
the history and philosophy of science (1940–54).
By the time he went to Paris, he had already
published 13 books and many articles focusing
mainly on issues related to physics.
Here began his rigorous investigations into the
formation of scientific and humanistic knowledge, which, he argued, took place not simply
by the accretion of facts, but rather by combat
leading to conquest over conventional epistemological hindrances in perception, opinion, and
reductive thinking that tended to become rigid
or absolute. More than merely dialectical thinking, Bachelard’s explorations could be termed

“multilectical,” for he refuses to be bound by
preconceived ideas that avoid what he calls
“unfixing” both traditional subject and object
relationships. He seeks a philosophic stance, exemplified in The Philosophy of No (1940) (1968), that
is decidedly open and capable of synthesizing the
historical revolutions in thought that have distinguished human experience and knowledge.
For Bachelard, this argumentative direction is
not a leap toward the irrational or the capricious
– just the opposite. His refusal to be “fixed” in
finite certitudes can be seen as an informed, conscious statement for a higher rationality, what he
calls a rationalité appliqué.
Besides Bachelard’s numerous articles (approximately 70), a series of 12 books on science, 2 on
time and consciousness, and 9 on poetic consciousness were written between 1928 and 1962.
In these intellectually ambitious treatises he strives
to identify, analyze, and argue for a coordinating
opposition between scientific rationalism and
poetic imagination, insisting that creativity must
flourish in both domains by way of redefining
the human project. Particularly by concentrated
attention to language and a reinterpretation of
Subject–Object relationships, we will be able
to affirm the interconnection between science
and poetry and the rational and imaginative
faculties. Thus, along with Barthes, Foucault,
Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre, Bachelard found
himself in the center of what was termed the “humanist controversy” in France, and was responsible

would have us explore the links between the two,
particularly since this interchange is revealed by
creativity shaped by the imagining process. For
him, images and imagistic patterns are constantly
and naturally forming in our consciousness, and
his repeated reference to “psychoanalysis” calls
attention to the phenomenological interrelationship humans establish with the world, and not to
the “psyche” of writer and reader.
In essence, Bachelard considers himself to be
one who incorporates scientific, philosophic, and
literary principles in the service of becoming (not
being) a serious reader of images: the “Text,”
which includes the physical universe we inhabit
in conjunction with consciousness, is the dynamic
starting point for revealing and developing the
human project of imagining. In such works as The
Psychoanalysis of Fire (1938), Earth and Reveries
of Will (1948), and The Poetics of Space (1957),
Bachelard does not direct us toward a theory of
imagining; instead, he performs that act himself
or indicates how other writers reveal it in their
choice of imagery. Inhabited by a steady flow of
images, the meditative mind that is revealed to us
in a state of reverie illustrates our profound,
complex, and natural affiliation with self and
world – imagining is not theoretical, abstract,
nor problematic; it is actual, vital, and akin to what
we do and are. Said in another way, humans are
imagining beings whose deepest identity is created by the world of their inclusive experience.
Bachelard, at least, would encourage us to imagine such a remarkable human condition.

Bachelard, Gaston

for inventing the concept of the “epistemological
break,” or, without incongruity, the capacity for
discontinuity and indeterminacy in formal thought
patterns. Furthermore, he is credited with having
inspired literary critics and scholars, especially in
the 1960s and after, by fostering and facilitating
the theoretical directions for New criticism,
Structuralism, and Poststructuralism. According to Roland Barthes and Gilbert Durand,
Bachelard not only provided the foundation for
a new critical school, but also, and for the first
time, forced French thinkers to take imagination
seriously, thereby producing significant debate –
precisely what he hoped intellectual tension would
cultivate.
Bachelard’s seeming inconsistency as he moves
beyond conventional scientific and literary thinking is based on a failure by critics and theorists
to recognize his aptitude for “debasing” his own
and others’ thought-in-progress, which he takes
seriously as a willingness to allow mental images
to assume a primacy in forming and de-forming
the thinking process. Basically anti-Cartesian in
philosophical outlook, but trained as a mathematician and physicist, he rigorously analyzes the
way in which language and external phenomena
interact abrasively to create our human reality,
embracing both subjectivity and objectivity,
becoming and being simultaneously. When the
languages of mathematics and science, of Phenomenology and Psychoanalysis, and of poetry,
for example, consistently challenge our traditional
assumptions, they can be seen as creative formulations to generate original thinking. Thus we constantly come to new thought patterns not through
agreement or harmony, but rather by going against
the grain of our knowledge, by “unfixing” or
deconstructing our paradigmatic perspectives.
Because Bachelard’s speculative approach to
science, philosophy, and literature disavows categorization, he is looked upon with understandable
suspicion by thinkers whose domains range from
applied science to abstract literary theory. If imagination is given preeminence in the human ways
of knowing, then obviously followers of all traditional epistemology will be forced to reexamine
radically any claim concerning the nature of reality or truth. Although we assert the difference
between rational and imaginative faculties –
exemplified by scientific endeavors being opposed
to poetic expression – none the less, Bachelard

Badiou, Alain

44
`Badiou, Alain (1937–) 
French philosopher.
L’Être et l’événement (Being and Event) and
Logiques des mondes (Logics of Worlds), which
followed it eighteen years later, are the two major
volumes that frame the principal oeuvre of Alain
Badiou. Earlier works such as Théorie du sujet
(Theory of the Subject) are no longer integral to
Badiou’s system. Even setting aside the creative
work, which is extensive, and the three volumes
of political essays (Circonstances 1, 2, and 3),
there are numerous essays and shorter works –
including volumes on Saint Paul and Gilles
Deleuze – that constitute the extension and
elaboration of this system.
Badiou’s numerous polemical statements, in
his essays and in the introductions to the longer
works, attack such favored targets as liberal ethics
and the fashionable consensus around Nietzschean relativism and Heideggerean hermeneutics.
Badiou’s essays are attractive and effective, but are
not his main mode. Badiou follows Plato in his
suspicion of doxa (opinion) in contrast to the
eternity of aletheia (truth) and his enterprise is
centered on the productions of axioms in the form
of fixed formulae, presented in the form of set
theory in L’Être et l’événement and topos theory
in Logiques des mondes.
The relationship between philosophy and poetic
language is a cornerstone for Badiou’s activities.
L’Être et l’événement locates Heidegger as Badiou’s
principal interlocutor. From Heidegger, Badiou
adopts the task of constructing a philosophical
ontology, while from Lacan he takes the task of
retheorizing the subject. Badiou’s displacement
of Heidegger takes place around the axis of the
opposition between language and mathematics.
Heidegger, followed in various ways by more
recent thinkers, has constructed an ontology – a
discourse of “being-as-being” – that is fundamentally poetic. Heidegger, according to Badiou,
remains within metaphysics in his account of
being as “call” and “gift,” “presence” and “opening,” and of ontology as the “uttering” of a “way
of proximity.” Badiou refers here to the later work
of Heidegger, with its emphasis on language,
poetry, and poets, including Parmenides, Réné
Char, Hölderlin, and Trakl. Against the “seduction
of poetic proximity” Badiou offers “the radically
subtractive dimension of being,” which cannot
be “represented” or even “presented” (L’Être et

l’événement, p. 16; Being and Event, p. 10; all
translations in this entry are my own; hereafter
referenced as EE/BE). To break the impasse of the
“excess of presence” offered by poetic ontology,
a mathematical ontology must be put in its
place. As Badiou wryly notes, this turn to mathematics is inconvenient for most philosophers,
whose habitual discourses are to be supplanted,
nor is it supported by mathematicians, who
embrace the truth process of mathematical practice and are uninterested in revisiting earlier
findings to tease out their ontological implications.
“Our aim is to establish the metaontological
thesis that mathematics is the historicity of the
discourse on being-as-being” (EE, p. 20; BE, p. 13)
Philosophy will have a particular, restricted function. It will not substitute itself for mathematics
by presenting itself as a science of being, nor will
it substitute itself for politics by presenting itself
as a science of society. Badiou is a longstanding
Maoist in the French post-1968 tradition, and an
activist with continuing involvement in groups
assisting undocumented workers in France (when
Badiou speaks of what is not represented quite
often he seems to have in mind absence of political representation within the state). Political militancy and philosophy are kept entirely separate
in Badiou’s work. Despite an evident love of
political militancy, which is always identified
with leftist revolutionary activity, Badiou rejects
all attempts at “political philosophy” and his
attempt to create a philosophical model of the
“event” can be construed as perhaps principally
an attempt to model political revolution without
recourse to the Marxist model of historicaldialectical prediction.
L’Être et l’événement claims that philosophy
does not produce truth, but axioms. The role of
philosophy is enabled by the existence of four
“generic procedures” later called “conditions,”
which have a subordinate position in the text of
L’Être et l’événement, but are set out more fully
in Manifeste pour la philosophie and Conditions.
These “truth procedures” or “generic procedures”
are named as “science (or more precisely the
matheme), art (more precisely the poem), politics
(more precisely interior politics, or politics of
emancipation) and love (more precisely the procedure which makes truth of the disjunction of
sexed positions)” (Conditions, p. 79). Three of these

45
arguing with reference to the power set that
there is a distinction between the state of a situation and the situation itself – between what is
present in a state and what is represented – and
the exposition moves from the seemingly abstract
notion of “state” to the (in fact already apparent)
example of the historical-social state. Still discussing being, preparatory to discussing the event,
Badiou asks whether nature is poem or matheme.
Rejecting the poetic ontology of Heidegger, he
argues that a situation can be regarded as natural if the multiples it contains, and all multiples
they contain, are “normal”: that is, there is the
“maximum connection between belonging and
inclusion”; “nature is that which is normal, the
multiple re-assured by the state” (EE, p. 146; BE,
pp. 127–8). Although there can be natural situations, there can be no Nature as such, which
would be “the totality of being-natural,” an
impossible “multiple composed of all ordinals.”
However, it can be asserted that a “natural infinite
multiplicity exists” (EE, pp. 159–60, 167; BE,
pp. 140, 148). So in the theory of being developed
in the first three sections of L’Être et l’événement,
being is never present as a single being but always
as multiplicities of multiplicities sutured to the
void, and while situations can be described as
natural there is no single underlying Nature, just
an infinity of natural situations.
For Badiou, not only what is natural belongs to
being, but also all that part of the social that is
concerned with repetition and routine. Events
are only those occurrences that introduce something new into society, so they do not include
natural events even if these have human consequences, and they do not include social events
that are not transformative. Badiou’s ontology
acknowledges only a certain type of event that is
revolutionary and transformative. His principal
models are political, mathematical and artistic,
to which he adds love as an event that is the
business only of the “Two” if not of a wider community. It is important to be clear what counts
as an event for Badiou because without this
guiding information the abstract mapping of the
event makes little intuitive sense. While Badiou
clearly indicates what type of occurrence constitutes an event in this ontology, he does not
provide us with any empirical tests, though his
event appears to be tied to fairly commonsense or

Badiou, Alain

procedures supply the themes of the three 1998
volumes on metapolitics, the inaesthetic, and
transitory ontology.
L’Être et l’événement does not deal with art or
the poetic as such, but Badiou’s potential importance for cultural theory rests on it. Each section
of L’Être et l’événement deploys three discursive
modes: prose formulation, mathematical formulation (using Cantor, Gödel, and Cohen), and
illustrative dialogue with texts from the “great
history of philosophy.” These texts include not
only philosophers but two poets: Mallarmé and
Hölderlin. Mallarmé is the most important poet
for Badiou. It is striking that poets are presented
as belonging to the history of philosophy. In
Manifeste, Badiou develops the case for the
existence of an “age of poets,” running from
Hölderlin to Celan, in which the poem has been
the bearer of “certain of the functions of philosophy” (Manifeste pour la philosophie, p. 49). In
L’Être et l’événement Mallarmé’s work is presented in the key section on the event more or
less as example of the same philosophical workings. The role allocated to a strictly delimited
number of poets – plus Samuel Beckett – alerts
us that the treatment of the artistic and literary
in Badiou’s work gives the means to deal with a
particular range of (basically) modernist works.
It also alerts us that Badiou’s apparent identification with Plato – who attacked poets – is a
little more complicated than it first appears.
Badiou evokes Plato in the rejection of poetic
language in philosophy, the affirmation of the Idea,
and the attack on modern sophists – declaring that
“Wittgenstein is our Gorgias” (Conditions,
p. 61). It may be no surprise then that it is
Mallarmé, the most Platonist of all poets, who
provides the bridge back into a celebration of the
literary as a truth process, and – what is not the
same thing – of literature as philosophy.
The argument of L’Être et l’événement is not
in outline of massive complexity. To begin with,
Badiou establishes the idea that ontology must
recognize not underlying totality, but endless
multiplicity. Ontology is the theory of the pure
multiple, but since every multiple consists of
other multiples and there is no one, ontology must
found itself on the void, the multiple of nothing
(EE, pp. 70–1; BE, pp. 57–8). Badiou goes on to
distinguish between inclusion and belonging,

Badiou, Alain

46
received notions of political, artistic, and scientific
history pegged to such occurrences as the French
Revolution or the glory days of Cubism.
From his description of being, Badiou launches
his description of “that which is not being-asbeing”; that is, non-being (EE, p. 193; BE, p. 173).
The first step is to define the evental site and the
event. The evental site is not represented and,
unlike the global natural situation, is local. The
difference between an evental site and a natural
multiplicity is not intrinsic or absolute: the evental
site is historic, but any evental site can succumb
to the normalization of the state (the hint here
is of Bolshevism/Stalinization) (EE, p. 196; BE,
p. 176). The event as such is always localizable
within presentation, but is neither presented nor
presentable as such – it is supernumerary. The
event cannot be thought except by anticipating its
abstract form, and it cannot be averred except
retroactively by an intervening practice (EE, p. 199;
BE, p. 178). In the key discussion of the event,
Mallarmé’s Un coup de dés is cited as a metaphor
of the notion that an evental site borders the void
and presents itself only in what is impresentable.
In Mallarmé’s poem, the shipwreck alone gives
the allusive debris from which the undecidable
multiple of the event is composed in the evental
site. Pressing Mallarmé’s poem further, Badiou
goes on: “Between the event annulled by the
reality of its visible belonging to the situation
[if the master throws the dice] and the event
annulled by its total invisibility [if the master
does not open his hand], the only representable
concept of the event is the staging of its undecidability. Mallarmé’s poem is said to be a long
metaphoric treatment of the concept of undecidability” (EE, pp. 214–16; BE, pp. 192–4).
The event calls for intervention and fidelity.
Intervention is the process of recognizing an
event. Fidelity is the process of adhering to it.
While the state names the stability of a situation,
fidelity causes multiples that are contra-statal to
be presented in the situation. These multiples,
which fidelity organizes and gives legitimacy,
are marked by the event, although it would be
wrong to consider this grouping of multiples as
being the situation itself. Badiou criticizes vulgar
Marxism for mixing up the abstract notion of
the workers with the actual empirical workers.
Fidelity attaches to the event, not to the bearers
of fidelity (EE, pp. 263, 368–9; BE, pp. 238, 334).

Badiou deals at some level of complexity with
knowledge and its relationship to language, and
goes on to present the key idea of the generic, a
term that is said to be almost interchangeable with
the indiscernible. The generic is to be understood in terms of the opposition between truth
and knowledge. It is necessary, says Badiou, to
work out the relationship or de-relationship
between militant post-evental fidelity, on the
one hand, and a fixed state of knowledge (or the
encyclopedia of the situation) on the other (EE,
p. 361; BE, p. 327). While encyclopedic knowledge is presented within language, the truths that
flow from the complex of event/intervention/
operator-of-fidelity and from the inquiries that this
complex produces are unnameable in the language
of the situation. So truths are subtracted from
knowledge and counted by the state only in the
anonymity of their being (EE, pp. 373–5; BE,
pp. 338–41). Only love, art, science, and politics
generate these truths, considered “infinite” because
they derive from the event not from the operators, and may be adhered to by anyone. Other
practices cannot generate truths, not even philosophy, though philosophy is conditioned by
the generic procedures of its time and can “help”
the procedure that conditions it.
In the concluding element of his ontology,
Badiou deploys a notion of the subject that
avoids the traditional subject of philosophy and
psychoanalysis, although in its radical reduction
from the human Badiou’s conception still belongs
to the tradition of Lacan and Althusser.
“Subject” now is “any local configuration of a
generic procedure on which a truth rests.” The
subject is not a substance or an empty point;
it is certainly not the phenomenological or
transcendental subject; it is not invariably found
but is rare; it is always qualified by the generic procedure to which it belongs; it is neither an origin
nor a result (EE, p. 429; BE, pp. 391–2).
Badiou’s abstractions are geared to creating a
model of revolutionary change in all its forms –
political, artistic, and scientific. Critics of Badiou
have worried that his affirmation of the event risks
moral hollowness and might as easily describe
undesirable as well as desirable change. These
are value judgments of course, but Badiou does
in effect respond to such criticism in Logiques des
mondes, which includes a typology of the subject
– the faithful, the reactive, and the obscure – each

47

The main thing for us is that the paradoxical
connection between a subject without identity
and a law without basis grounds the possibility,
within history, of a universal predication. The
unprecedented gesture of Paul is the removal
of truth from the influence of community –
whether of a people, a city, an empire, a territory, or of a social class. (Saint Paul, p. 6)

This conception of Paul is asserted as antidote to
a contemporary cultural relativism in which all
truth claims are thought to emanate from the collective cultural position of the subject producing
them, and every subject is seen as a victim. Badiou
denounces the subdivision of society by contemporary identity politics and, with reference to
Deleuze’s concept of “deterritorialisation,” links
this phenomenon to the marketing strategy of
capitalism.
By way of demonstrating an alternative, Badiou
goes on to develop an account of the suspension
of Paul between Greek and Jewish culture, and his
evasion of the mastery inherent in each, whether
in the Greek discourse of wisdom or the Jewish
discourse of the law. Paul can defy each, asserting a truth that goes beyond law and wisdom and
also beyond race. Paul’s assertion is founded
not in law or in inquiry but in the event of
the resurrection, which as Badiou points out is the

single fact about Christ that Paul asserts. The rest
– the teachings, the miracles, and other supernatural material related in the (later) Gospels –
has no bearing on Paul’s faith and his ministry.
This analysis gives Badiou a way to talk about the
event as a singularity, as something that delivers
a subject, a reborn subject that is authorized by
the event and not by the discourse of law or
truth. The real that is the Christ-event brings
about a universalism in the subject that bypasses
the cultural specificity of Greek and Jew. Producing a fascinating parallel with Nietzsche, who
loudly denounces Paul in The Antichrist, Badiou
claims that the healthy subject so founded is
an affirmative “son-subject” from whom life
commences – by sending his son God the father
allows everyone to become a son and achieve
freedom from the law.
That which saves us is faith, not works. We are
not under the law, but under grace. Badiou gives
Paul’s central claims a new inflection, and draws
a series of theorems from his exposition of Paul,
concerning the one and the universal, the event,
the subject, and the law, the truth process, and
the power of truth – summarily, on the fidelity
of the subject to the truth-process that constitutes
it. Saint Paul, in effect, is a worked example of
Badiou’s ontology and gives a sense of how this
ontology can set the universality of a strictly
delimited notion of truth against subjectcentered ethics, in an age where events invite a
reconsideration of both political and religious
universality.

An important group of Russian
writers on literature, language and culture.
Bakhtin studied at St Petersburg University,
reading widely in philosophy and literature at a
time of high intellectual and political excitement.
Later he taught in Nevel and then Vitebsk, where

of which is ascribed characteristics according to
which of the four generic procedures it belongs
to. The result is a typology with a Jungian flavour
that is more ingenious than convincing.
It may be that Badiou’s model of the poetic,
and of the artistic in general, as a truth process,
will come to have less influence on cultural
theory than his Saint Paul, which discusses the
topic of universality, and may prove to have historiographical implications that will run beyond
anything Badiou specifically intends. Unlike
texts such as Samuel Beckett and the popular Le
Siècle, in which the presence of Badiou’s system
is subtly woven into an essayistic style, Saint
Paul combines accessibility with explicit theoretical systematization.
Saint Paul is prefaced by an introduction that
criticizes contemporary ethical thought centered
on the subject – a key target for Badiou – and outlines an interest in Paul as a subject neither
founded by nor founding any law.

he worked with many other artists and intellectuals including V.N. Voloshinov (1894–1936)
and P.N. Medvedev (1891–1938). From this circle
emerged several Texts which arose from shared
debates, touching on important and sensitive
issues in the difficult and highly policed early years
of the Soviet Union. Voloshinov died of an illness and Medvedev was shot, while Bakhtin, exiled
for a period, often ill but extraordinarily hardworking as a teacher and writer, maintained his
intellectual activities in the shadows despite a
briefly positive reception for his book on Dostoevsky, published in 1929. His dissertation on
Rabelais was controversial, and only much later
in his life was he recognized and praised in the
Soviet Union, even as some of the group’s books
began to appear in the West, where they have
become highly influential.
All these circumstances – the need to tread
warily, the flow of ideas which were exchanged
and discussed, the disappearance of some texts,
the emergence of others in translation, belatedly
and in a different climate – have unfortunately
created continual confusion about the group’s
work, which is still far from resolved. In part this
results from the richness and many-sidedness of
the arguments, which have been appropriated
in different ways, but there is also serious scholarly disagreement about the extent of shared or
disguised authorship so that writers have made
different assumptions about authorship and even
claimed that passages in the texts disguised the
intentions of the group. These matters are largely
unresolved and may remain so. Here texts are
referred to in the names of the several writers but
there can be no doubt of a common, at times
highly indirect and ironic, play of ideas.
The work of the group is situated between
that of the contemporary formalists and futurists
on the one hand, and that of the official Party line
on Culture on the other. It bears the marks of
both but explores sophisticated ways forward
from each. From the formalists had come an
emphasis on the distinctive properties of language and conventional devices in literary work,
close attention being paid to linguistic innovation
and the formal properties of literary texts with
little reference to other forms of language or the
social circumstances of Writing. By comparison
orthodox Party Marxism, increasingly intolerant
and suspicious of deviation, proclaimed Socialist

realism as its approved cultural vehicle and
argued that literature and language were reflections of social conditions and relations.
If there is a common program at all in the work
of Bakhtin’s group (which valued diversity), it
concerned the study of ideologies in their “social
qualities:” “what is lacking is a properly worked
out sociological study of the specific properties
of the material, forms and goals belonging to
each of the domains of ideological creativity”
(Medvedev, 1928); “the forms of signs are conditioned above all by the social organisation of the
participants involved and also by the immediate conditions of their interaction” (Voloshinov, 1929);
“primitive marketplace genres prepared the setting
for the popular-festive forms and images of the
language in which Rabelais expressed his own new
truth about the world” (Bakhtin, 1965). Some of
the group’s studies are highly theoretical, offering critiques of psychology and Psychoanalysis
for their misreading of the social being of individual consciousness; Bakhtin’s own work includes
detailed though boldly wide-ranging studies of
Dostoevsky, Rabelais and his understanding of
the novel, also a number of difficult meditations
upon forms of writing and much else.
Medvedev’s work (probably written with
Bakhtin, 1928) paid tribute to the formalists as
worthy foes in the development of a more adequate account of literature in which the “concrete
life” of a work of art should be seen in its literary
milieu, that milieu within a larger ideological
milieu, and both within their socioeconomic
setting. The program attempted to dissolve the
distinction between text and context, between
properties intrinsic and others extrinsic to the
literary work, by locating works within genres
which at once required forms of Literary production and intended audiences which are inside,
not outside, a genre’s development.
A year later, Voloshinov’s book on language
attacked forcefully both a notion of individual
consciousness and the Reification of language
(as potentially in Saussure and many dominant
forms of linguistics) as an objective System.
Instead language was neither merely subjective
nor wholly objective. Words were an “index of
social changes” and (controversially in Soviet
Marxism) because “class does not coincide with
the sign community . . . different classes will use
one and the same language” so that “differently

49
difficult and cryptic strand of his work (1981) presented three models of possible language situations:
monoglot, with a shared language and strong
cohesion of values; polyglot, in which languages
coexist; and heteroglot, where inside a unified
common language there are divergent voices and
registers. His own boldly wide-ranging form of
the novel proclaimed those moments in which
contradictory opinions could be voiced simultaneously, while his work on Rabelais and the
carnival celebrated the productivity of popular
pleasures against officialdom. In fact his writing
has much in common with the contemporary
music of Shostakovich, with whose situation and
thus, in the group’s analysis, utterances Bakhtin
had much in common. In both, ambiguous and
qualified presentations of official thinking are cut
across by a huge, almost uncontrolled variety of
other voices, often sardonic and ironic, in a “victory” over linguistic (or musical) “dogmatism.”
Current knowledge of the writings of the
Bakhtin group, its debates, and degree of shared
purpose is tantalizingly incomplete and likely
to remain so. It seems that the writings were of
necessity “double coded,” though that quality
and the celebration of difference has brought
Bakhtin into the field of postmodernist thought.
It has been possible not only to see in the work
a tactical retreat from key Marxist positions,
but also to see Voloshinov’s writing on conflict
through language and the ideological sign, and
Bakhtin’s on the social construction of literary
voices, as crucial enrichments in contemporary
Marxism against an economist reductionist tradition. Elsewhere, despite the constant ambiguity
in the group’s work towards the distinctiveness
of literary strategies from other forms of utterance,
Bakhtin has been noted for offering a distinctive
poetics of texts as polyphonic: Todorov (1984)
called him the “greatest theoretician of literature
in the twentieth century.”
If one user of the group’s work values its
analysis of intertextuality, others look outside
the play of texts at their broader treatment of language and culture. The notion of dialog between
Discourses, however enigmatically and abstractly
treated at times, is a fundamental contribution.
Another is the treatment of a set of shifting
relations between official and popular forms. A
third is the approach to the grotesque not as a
convention or form but as a registration of the

Bakhtin, Mikhail (1895–1975) and colleagues

oriented accents intersect in every ideological
sign” and Sign “becomes an arena of the Class
struggle.” The study of language was that of
“the particular situation of the utterance and its
audience” within “genres of behavioural speech”
(“the drawing-room causerie, urban carouses,
workers’ lunchtime chats”). Signs possessed a
“social multiaccentuality” since they were constantly appropriated for different purposes even
if “the inner dialectic quality of the sign comes
out fully in the open only in times of social crises
or revolutionary changes.” Though this work
became known only much later and in quite different intellectual settings, it staked out a distinctive
agenda for a materialist study of language forms
within a variety of social situations in culture,
analyzing “speech performances” and their typical, yet open-ended characteristics as inextricably
linked to transactions offering possibilities for
exchange, conflict and struggle.
In work later known as Bakhtin’s primarily
or alone, references by Voloshinov to “the active
reception of other speakers’ speech” becomes a
much larger study of a principle of social dialog
(the internalization of and speaking to other
positions) in forms of writing as well as speech.
Equally, the “differently oriented social interests”
extend to a dense celebration of cultural “heterogeneity.” Utterances imply listeners and in
Bakhtin’s most valued writers different voices
coexist, irrupting against each other in a ceaseless play. His study of Dostoevsky asserts that
the author’s work is distinctively polyphonic,
articulating a number of positions and refusing
to privilege any of them. In his long and densely
referenced study of Rabelais, the typical forms of
carnival (shows and pageants, parodies, cursing
and swearing) are seen as the creative busting
forth of a repressed world of folk culture, its
interests in bodies and blasphemy, into the official
medieval world: “the bodily lower stratum of
grotesque realism still fulfilled its unifying, degrading, uncrowning and simultaneously regenerating
functions.” Both books locate literary work (as the
Rabelais study puts it) within “the very depths
of the life of that time” within which “an active
plurality of languages . . . led to exceptional linguistic freedom.”
Necessarily, Bakhtin’s own “utterances” were
sensitive to the presence of other voices in the
increasingly grim circumstances of Soviet life. A

body against the spirituality (and repression) of
Aesthetics and thought. A fourth is the interest in Heteroglossia and difference, “processes
of decentralisation and disunification” next to
“verbal–ideological centralisation and unification” (1981).
Bakhtin remarked at the end of his book on
Rabelais (1965) that belles lettres and the modern
novel were “born on the boundaries of two
languages” and it is the group’s exploration of
this shifting position, and their own location
between formalist aesthetics (to which they paid
tribute) and Party Marxism (which they saw as a
deformation even as they suffered from it) which
has given their work its remarkable suggestiveness,
breadth, and new relevance.

`Balibar, Etienne (1942–) 
French Marxist
theoretician, former pupil and collaborator of
Louis Althusser, and a lecturer in philosophy
at the University of Paris (Sorbonne). For 20 years
a member of the French Communist Party until
his exclusion in 1981, Balibar has since been prominent in anti-racist campaigns in France. From the
1960s to the 1990s these political commitments
have profoundly marked his intellectual engagements, which focused on four main, interrelated
areas: (i) critical development of a “historical epistemology” – an anti-empiricist French tradition

in the history and philosophy of science, associated with Gaston Bachelard, Jean Cavaillès,
and Georges Canguilhem; (ii) interrogation
and reconstruction of theoretical Marxism in
light of the record of historical Communism –
the joint, internationally influential enterprise
of “Althusserianism,” undertaken with Pierre
Macherey and Michel Pêcheux among others;
(iii) interpretation of the political actuality of the
thought of Spinoza, classical philosopher-general
of Althusserian Marxism; and (iv) reflections
and interventions on contemporary nationalism
and Racism.
In his best-known work (1965), Balibar employed Bachelardian–Althusserian categories to
reconstruct historical materialism as the general
theory of social formations founded by Marx.
Arguing that the concept of “mode of production,”
properly understood, effected an “epistemological
break” with the prior tradition of the philosophy
of history, initiating a “science of history” in its
stead, Balibar sought to displace quasi-Hegelian
formulations of Marxism. In particular, this
meant rejection of the evolutionism of orthodox
historical materialism which, basing itself upon
Marx’s 1859 Preface (1976), conceived the advent
of communism as the preordained result of
the autonomous, progressive development of the
productive forces. Prioritizing the category of
“reproduction” over that of “contradiction,” and
affirming the explanatory primacy of the social
relations of production, Balibar advanced a
theory of historical transition from one mode of
production to another, in which the determinant instance was the Class struggle, and not the
master contradiction between (advanced) productive forces and (retarded) property relations.
Balibar’s insistence on the constitutive complexity of concrete social formations, irreducible
to the “laws of motion” of a single mode of production, proved immensely fertile for subsequent
Marxist research. However, in response to critiques
of the rationalist epistemology informing Reading “Capital,” he abandoned the project of a
“general theory” of modes of production (1974,
pp. 227–45). Here, as in his defense of Leninism
against the tactical adjustments of the PCF (1976),
the influence of a certain Maoism, derived from
the professed principles (though not the actual
practices) of the Cultural Revolution, can be discerned, characteristic of the theoretico-political

`Barthes, Roland (1915–80)
French critic
whose constantly innovative writings were greatly
influential in literary and Cultural studies.
From 1960 Barthes taught at the Ecole Pratique
des Hautes Etudes in Paris, offering a seminar
under the heading “Sociology of signs, symbols
and representations.” In 1976 he was elected to
a chair in “literary semiology” at the Collège de
France.
Barthes’s work was wide-ranging in the topics
it treated and the areas in which it was important. Individual books and articles made decisive
contributions to the development of Semiology,
the structural analysis of narrative, the study of
specific sign systems (that of fashion, for example),
the redefinition of Literary criticism, the

reading of particular works or bodies of work
(those of Sade, Michelet, Proust, Sollers, and
numerous others, including artists and composers), the understanding of the social use and
subjective experience of photographs (the list
could be extended). It would be difficult to find
many aspects of the contemporary Culture that
did not somewhere receive consideration in the
multitude of his texts and interviews, and this
underlines the extent to which Barthes filled and
helped define a certain role of the intellectual
crucially and critically engaged in the demonstration and questioning of the culture’s given
realities as systems of meaning, as implicated in
processes of signification which precisely structure
and inform their “givenness.” Over all its diversity,
throughout its various stages of development,
Barthes’s work was characterized by this concern with conditions of meaning: with the ways
in which meanings are made, presented, fixed,
grounded, and then with the ways in which they
can be unmade, challenged, displaced, pluralized.
His approach was always in terms of language, the
one unfailing object of his attention and investment, his curiosity and desire.
The initial writings dealt explicitly with social
operations of language, the power of institutionalized forms of meaning. Writing Degree Zero
(1953) took literature as such a form and described an inescapable sociality of language to which
it is bound. Language exists not as a neutral
instrument for the untrammeled expression of a
writer’s message, a channel for the passage of an
independent content, but as so many orders of
Discourse, so many sociolects or “Writings”
which inform and shape that message and content. A writing – an écriture – is language loaded
with a consistency of representation, bringing
with it a ready-made version of “reality” that
coercively runs together facts and norms, information and judgment. Such set forms make up
– are – the society’s intelligibility, “naturally” its
vision of things. Literature is part of this vision:
a defined and regulated site of language use that
holds a writer’s Text to repetition of its constraining sense of “literature.” Modern writers,
from Flaubert onwards, are distinguished by an
acute consciousness of this social occupation of
language and engaged thereby in a struggle to write
free of the forms of a society from which they are
divided by that very consciousness (no longer

Barthes, Roland

orientation of many French Marxists in the late
1960s and 1970s.
Amid the “crisis of Marxism,” Balibar has
refused the familiar options of sheer renunciation
or mere reassertion of Marx, offering a nuanced
appreciation of his enduring significance (1993b).
His recent work, some of it undertaken via a
dialog with the historical sociologist Immanuel
Wallerstein (1988), has been preoccupied with the
burning philosophical and political issues posed
by the emergence throughout the advanced capitalist world of a new “integral nationalism” and
neoracism, whose legitimating ideology is “cultural
difference.” Among the arresting theses of Balibar’s
successive interventions is that theoretical racism
is a “theoretical humanism.” Summoning his
readers to “an effective anti-racism” (Balibar and
Wallerstein, 1988, p. 13) as the precondition of
a renewed class politics, Balibar evinces his commitment to a cosmopolitan vocation for political
philosophy, as exemplified by Baruch Spinoza.

Barthes, Roland

52
any innocence of language), while at the same
time inevitably returned to it in the very act of
writing (no stepping outside its sociality). Mythologies (1957) focused on the objects and events
of everyday life as replete with meaning, thick
with a mythical discourse that seeks to convey as
universal the particular values it represents. It is
this conversion of cultural sense into essential
nature which Barthes refers to as myth and
identifies as the defining mode of the bourgeois
Ideology of his society, tracking it down in a
wrestling match or a poem (Writing Degree Zero
was exactly a mythology of literary language), in
an advertisement for spaghetti or the staging
of a play (in a series of reviews contemporary
with Mythologies, Barthes championed Brecht’s
practice of displaying meanings, offering them
frankly to be read as such, against that of a bourgeois theater that hides them in the naturalistic
illusion of a presentation of “life”).
Mythologies ended with a theoretical essay
which drew on the linguistic notion of the Sign
to give an account of mythical Discourse as a
System of Connotation: myth takes over an
initial Signifying system as the support – the
signifier – for new meanings proposed as motivated by the initial system, simply “there.” In
what he would later characterize as a euphoric
dream of scientificity, Barthes played a major
part in the development of semiology, the science
of signs envisaged by Saussure, and in Elements of Semiology (1964) provided a synthesis
of its terms and concepts. In fact, semiology was
always for him a potentially critical discourse
that, with its formal analyses of the systematic conditions of meanings in social life, contributed to
the demystification of the workings of ideology
that had been his first preoccupation. Semiology,
that is, helped provide the tools for an effective
critique of a “society of communication” dependent on a regime of meaning in which signs
are proffered as closed unities of an exchange of
sense from one Subject to another. Insisting on
an understanding of signification – the production of signs – and on the subject not as some
full consciousness originating meaning but as set
in place within signifying systems, Barthes was
concerned semiologically with the demystification
of the sign (“the great affair of Modernity”),
but then too with that of semiology itself for its
failure to question its own dependence on the

sign as focus and limit of its analyses. Semiology
describes signifying systems, but assumes in so
doing the idea of the sign as the join of a signifer
and a signified in a way that allows the latter to
continue to be regarded as a prior content that the
former comes to express and so the maintenance
of the accepted terms of subject, meaning, and
communication. As opposed to which, Barthes was
concerned increasingly to stress the productive
nature of signifying systems – their realization
of subject positions and terms of meaning – and
to acknowledge the all-pervasive fact – the
everywhereness – of language: there is no object
or content or ground of meaning outside of a
signifying process giving it as such, and so no
Metalanguage, inasmuch as no language can
reach some objectivity outside of language and no
metalinguistic representation can be more than
a particular construction within the infinite movement of language, a productivity that can never
be brought to an end – other than in some theological or metaphysical or scientistic imagination
of closure (semiology fell too easily into the latter:
a scientific discourse conceiving itself as science
but refusing to consider itself as Discourse).
As regards Literary criticism, such an emphasis on language meant a challenge to beliefs
in works as deriving their meaning from a reality they represent or a mind they express (in a
famous essay of 1967 Barthes announced the
death of the Author) and a perception of the
critic as creatively trying them out with different
interpretative models. On Racine (1963) gave a
structural and thematic reading of the corpus of
Racine’s plays through the languages of anthropology and Psychoanalysis, while Criticism and
Truth (1966) defended this procedure against
traditional literary-historical “author-and-works”
attacks, and succinctly stated Barthes’s critical
premises: there is no impartial choice of a system
of interpretation and objectivity is a choice of
language institutionally sanctioned as such; what
counts is the rigor with which the language
chosen is applied, not the meaning of the work
but the meaning of what the critic says of it;
there is, indeed, no arriving at “the meaning of
the work” (contrary assertions by certain academic
approaches are yet another example of mythical
discourse, attempts to hide their “objective”
meanings as those of “the work itself ”), no final
grounds for stopping the plurality into which,

53
The theory of the text finally can only coincide
with writing, can sustain no metalinguistic distance.
Barthes the semiologist was overtaken by Barthes
the writer, his work moving away from any
representation of a knowledge, any possibility of
codification into an externally applicable theoretical system (no equivalent, for instance, to the
Deconstruction derived from Derrida). He
talked of himself more and more as an amateur,
writing not professionally, under some conception of a discipline, but perversely, under the
sway of desire, shifting intellectual analysis to
questions of enjoyment. The Pleasure of the Text
(1973b) recast the readerly/writerly distinction of
S/Z into a reflection on pleasure and Jouissance,
exploring in a series of brief notations the cultural
enjoyments of language that works may produce
and then the radical orgasmic abandonment of
the subject that is the extreme experience – the
Jouissance – of texts. This writing desire, transgressing academic forms and procedures, distinguished Barthes’s subsequent writings which
variously engage the subject in language. Roland
Barthes by Roland Barthes (1975) set Barthes
out in a series of novelistic fragments, so many
“biographemes” to capture and examine a certain
imaginary construction of the writer; A Lover’s
Discourse (1977c) traced the different moments
of the subjectivity of love through the various
episodes of language in which it is deployed;
Camera Lucida (1980) explored the terms of
the subject engaged in the experience of photographs, again mixing analysis and biography.
These books and other writings brought Barthes
close to the novel, but the novel without any certainty of subject or representation, without any
coherence of narrative action or narrating voice.
The last course he taught concerned, indeed,
the conditions on which a writer of today could
conceive of undertaking a novel. The posthumously published Incidents (1987) contains
reflections on ways of writing the novelistic surface of everyday existence, together with short diary
entries for two different periods of Barthes’s life.
These are the first pieces in which Barthes is
explicit about his homosexuality, but his work may
be importantly read as inflected by a gay textual
attention: in accordance with his overall refusal
of imperatives of meaning, homosexuality is
precisely not a signified in his texts but rather a
matter of the signifier, a particular retreat from

Barthes, Roland

as language, works open. Traditional criticism
submits works exactly to the regime of the sign
and seeks the signified as a secret to be deciphered,
brought out by a discipline of knowledge that
thereby explains – represents – the work, settles
its meaning. Against which, Barthes as critic
assumes the materiality of the signifier and seeks
to set works off into a multitude of readings, effecting displacements of meaning, realizing their
plural potential.
Barthes puts this as the movement from work
to text. The works of “literature” are themselves
elaborated within the regime of the sign, bound
up in given terms of meaning and making a
powerful “readerly” representation. In S/Z (1970),
Barthes demonstrates this readerliness through
a detailed phrase-by-phrase account of a Balzac
novella, showing the ways in which narrative
and other codes combine to construct a particular, “natural” direction of reading in the interests
of a particular coherence – precisely a settlement
– of meaning. His demonstration, however, is
simultaneously that of the novella’s plurality
which the limiting direction of reading cannot fully
contain, since any hold over language is itself
a linguistic production, exceeded by language;
Barthes’s reading, that is, returns Balzac’s work
to textuality, to a “writerliness” – its availability
for a proliferation of meanings, for an experience
of the signifier. What Barthes then understands
by and values as text is at once the possibility
of plurality in the classic work; the aim and
achievement of modern avant-garde nonrepresentational practices of language; an apprehension
of language and the signifier that can be had in
the interstices of everyday life as well as in written works (“the living writing of the street”);
a utopian vision of plurality. In connection with
this, a second sense of écriture is developed by
Barthes, contrary to that of Writing Degree Zero:
writing now names a practice that unsettles forms
of closure (the mythical instrumentalizations
of language to which écriture earlier referred;
writing in this new sense is intransitive, indeterminate in address, nonrepresentational). Such
a practice breaks down the division between
reader and writer: no longer communication
from one to the other but a textual performance
in which both instances are put in question, subject and signified dispersed across the “other
scene” of language’s infinite productivity.

base and superstructure

54
the rectitude of the fixed divisions of sexes and
signs, all the ready sense of sexuality.
Barthes’s work finally brings an ethical sensibility. The visceral dislike of the mass of
communications, of the foregone conclusions of
signs and meanings, goes along with the pleasure
in the mobility of signs, the enchantment with the
signifier. What is vital for Barthes is always the
achievement of a space of movement, some play
in the field of meaning: demystification and
displacement of the fixtures of sense, access to plurality, desire in language (Barthes registers distress
at what he sees as his society’s giving up of language as a site of pleasure, not for any purpose,
in perversion). The marginal (askew to given
terms and positions), the individual (not unity
of the person but a network of singularities), the
neutral (the utopia of some peace from meanings)
became the key words and topics of his last
courses and writings. Literature – works read in
their textuality, for their writing – was, as ever, the
necessary reference here: literature as the experience of the freedom that it was Barthes’s project
as critic, theorist, and writer to propose.

`base and superstructure 
The concept of
base and superstructure was first employed
by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in The
German Ideology (1845) (1976), to posit the theory that the forces and relations of labor (the base)
within a society determine its social consciousness
(the superstructure) and class system, all of which
in turn shape the entity of the state for the good
of its ruling class.
The concept is defined in this passage from
Marx’s Preface to A Contribution to the Critique
of Political Economy (1859) (1976):
In the social production of their life, men enter
into definite relations that are indispensable
and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of

development of their material forces. The sum
total of these relations of production constitutes
the economic structure of a society, the real
foundation, on which rises a legal and political
superstructure and to which correspond definite
forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social,
political and intellectual life process in general.
It is not the consciousness of men that determines
their being, but on the contrary, their social
being that determines consciousness. (Marx,
1976, p. 3)

In terms of the elements of the superstructure,
Marx and Engels identify law, politics, religion,
Aesthetics, and Art as “definite forms of social
consciousness,” which they term “ideology.” Ideology, which purports to represent the ideas of an
entire society, (its “social consciousness”), actually serves to validate the power of the ruling
social class, the owners of economic production.
However, Marx and Engels also theorize that
superstructure and ideology are not mere reflections of a society’s economic base; both grow
from the economic base, but may develop apart
from it as well, often functioning with considerable autonomy. In addition, the sophistication of
the base does not necessarily correspond to the
sophistication of the superstructure. For example,
a society which is economically underdeveloped
may attain considerable artistic achievements.
Marx uses the case of classic Greek civilization to
press the issue that “in the case of the arts, it is
well known that certain periods of their flowering are out of all proportion to the general
development of society, hence also to the material foundation, the skeletal structure . . . of its
organization.” Engels in particular suggests that
the relationship between the base and the superstructure is not an automatic or strictly linear one:
the superstructure (or parts of it) can actually
create change within the base, rather than merely
reflect it (Marx and Engels, 1968, pp. 682–3).

the carnal. The grounds of Bataille’s argument
with surrealism, at least as its principles were
expounded by André Breton, were that its interest in such excessive and unspeakable forms was
accessory to the aim of sublimating the real into
the “sur-real,” the higher reality apprehended by
art. Bataille’s interest was drawn by contrast to the
degradation of carnality, and especially those
portions or functions of the human body which
cannot but pose a threat to the integrity of
individual and social identity, and so must be
expelled from consciousness or acknowledgement
– the anus, the genitals, the big toe. This interest
may be contrasted with that of the Soviet linguist
and critic Mikhail Bakhtin. Where Bakhtin’s
aim is to reintegrate a body politic which has split
itself neurotically and repressively between upper
and lower, Bataille refuses to allow the expulsive,
subversive violence of the body to be safely recuperated in the larger integration of the person or
the social group.
Bataille’s interest in everything excessive to or
unassimilable by official social forms, an interest
which he called “heterology,” received a decisive
impetus from his reading in the late 1920s of
the work of the French anthropologist Marcel
Mauss. Mauss’s The Gift (1923) includes an
analysis of the practice of potlatch among native
people of the Northwestern American coast, a
practice in which prodigious quantities of goods
and property are ceremonially destroyed with no
other purpose than the gratuitous exhilaration
derived from the act. Bataille responded enthusiastically to Mauss’s suggestion that the practice
of potlatch pointed to an economic, social, and
psychological principle in human life which was
at odds with the principles of utility and rational
self-interest which held sway in developed societies. The idea that the fundamental drive in all
human life is towards glorious expenditure rather
than prudent conservation is enlarged upon in
Bataille’s 1933 essay “The notion of expenditure”
(Bataille, 1985, pp. 116–29). This idea made sense
of Bataille’s fascination up to that time with the
laughable, the grotesque, and the formless, in fact
with everything that official society stigmatized as
wasteful or without value, and it remained the
organizing idea behind Bataille’s subsequent investigations into art, literature, politics, ethnology,
archaeology, philosophy, theology, sexuality, psychology, and economics. His Interior Experience

`Bataille, Georges (1897–1962) 
Although his
work as a novelist, philosopher, and theorist
of Art and Culture is intimately related to the
intellectual movements of the earlier part of
this century, and especially French surrealism,
Georges Bataille has exercised a powerful and
continuing influence on much philosophy and
Cultural theory during the 1960s, 1970s,
and 1980s, including the work of Jacques
Derrida, Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, Roland Barthes, and Julia Kristeva in his
native France, as well as critical and cultural
theorists elsewhere.
After an unpromising academic beginning,
Bataille trained as a librarian at the Ecole des
Chartes and in 1922 obtained a position at the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris which he was
to hold for 20 years until his resignation on
grounds of ill-health in 1942. After meeting
Michel Leiris in 1924, Bataille began an association with the surrealist movement. He was one
of the founders in 1929 of Documents, a review
devoted to subjects such as Art, ethnography,
and Psychoanalysis, to which he contributed
a number of rather disturbing and obsessional
essays. These aroused the wrath of André Breton,
the official leader of Parisian surrealism, with
whom Bataille was to be locked in bitter dispute
through the early years of the 1930s. During this
period, Bataille espoused an anti-Stalinist Marxism, which he expressed in his contributions to
the journal La Critique Sociale from 1931 to 1934
and in his interest in Contre-Attaque, a political
group which he founded in 1935. From 1936
onwards, however, the influence of Marx gave way
to that of Nietzsche, as Bataille joined a small
secret society of intellectuals called Acéphale,
after the title of the short-lived journal which they
published, and a more public group, the Collège
de Sociologie. The latter, with which Bataille was
associated from 1937 to 1939, was committed to
the exploration of the sacred in primitive social
life, and had the aim of making its forms and
energies available for developed societies. After the
war, Bataille devoted himself to ethnographic
investigations, theological and philosophical speculation, and the writing of fiction, much of it
pornographic.
From the beginning of his absorption in surrealism Bataille had been deeply attracted by the
movement’s interest in the base, the degraded, and

Bataille, Georges

56
(1943, trans. 1988) attempted to articulate the value
of a form of mystical self-abasement which
would not be a mere detour from the road to the
positive benefits of salvation or enlightenment. His
Literature and Evil (1957b, trans. 1985) explored
the principle of amoral intensity as he found it
in the works of Emily Brontë, William Blake, the
Marquis de Sade, and Jean Genet. In Eroticism
(1957a, trans. 1962), Bataille gathered evidence of
the close association between sexuality, violence,
and death, especially in practices of mutilation
and bodily extremity; this is an association
which had been elaborated in Bataille’s own
extraordinary pornographic fable, The Story of
the Eye (1928, trans. 1979), which was much
admired by Roland Barthes for its conjoining
of bodily and textual perversity. The most ambitious and encompassing statement of Bataille’s
economic theories is to be found in his The
Accursed Share (1949, trans. 1988), which argues
that the principle of expenditure in fact governs
the astrobiological economics of the physical
cosmos; Bataille finds the enactment of this in
the sun, which we are accustomed to think of
as the principle of life and increase, but is in
fact nothing more than a “ceaseless prodigality”
of slow but glorious self-destruction (Bataille,
1988, p. 29).
Bataille’s influence has been immense and farreaching. His uneasy relationship with Marxism,
for example, anticipates that of many later
French cultural theorists. Bataille for a time was
attracted by the possibility that Marxism might
release the revolutionary energies of transgression,
though he was increasingly repelled by the
repressive bureaucracy of state Marxism in the
Soviet Union. His fidelity to the idea of a politics
of ecstatic excess, which went beyond the constraining forms of institutionalized politics,
provided a powerful precedent for the “libidinal
politics” of Jean-François Lyotard, Gilles
Deleuze, and Félix Guattari in the late 1960s.
Bataille’s interest in Nietzsche may have been
partly responsible for transmitting the prestige of
this writer to French poststructuralism, especially in the work of Michel Foucault. Foucault
is drawn in particular to the principle of transgression that is theorized in Bataille’s work, a
transgression of boundaries that Foucault believes
goes beyond even the conventional divisions
between the conventional and the transgressive,

in its affirmation of “the limitlessness into which
it leaps as it opens this zone to existence”
(Foucault, 1997, p. 35). Jean Baudrillard’s
investigation during the early 1970s of the nature
of value in contemporary consumer society draws
heavily on Baudrillard’s writings on economics.
Bataille’s critique of what he saw as the inherent
conservatism of the economic model of the
psyche in Freudian psychoanalysis has been
taken up in various ways in the rereading of
Freud conducted by recent French psychoanalysts,
such as Jacques Lacan and Julia Kristeva; the
latter’s exploration of the force of the “abject”
in social and psychological life draws particularly
on Bataille. Perhaps the most significant area of
Bataille’s influence on contemporary thought
has been the impact of his writing on the work
of Jacques Derrida. Derrida’s essay on Bataille
in his Writing and Difference explores the challenge
which Bataille’s work offers to the prestige of
reason in the Hegelian tradition. Where, in the
dialectical process described by Hegel, reason
encounters its opposite or negation, in order
finally to assimilate that negativity to a heightened
and enlarged self-knowledge, Bataille’s work
proposes the ways in which reason can negotiate
its own forms of absolute undoing or, in the
term which Bataille uses to run together the economic and the philosophical, “dé-pense.” Such
a procedure has much in common with the process of Deconstruction which Derrida goes on
to develop in later work.

logical and necessary extension of the rationalization of the means of production.
In For a Critique of the Political Economy of the
Sign (1972) and The Mirror of Production (1973),
Baudrillard mounts a devastating assault on the
idea of production which is so central to Marxist
sociology. He focuses in these two books on the
Marxist theory of value, and especially on the fundamental distinction it draws between use values,
which are held to be immediate, authentic, and
unfalsifiable, and exchange values, which come into
being with the institution of the market, and are
artificial, distorted, and exploitative. Baudrillard’s
argument is that all needs of whatever kind are
always produced as the effect of structures of
exchange and, latterly, as an effect of the code of
consumption. The notion of use value therefore
offers no political promise of redemption from the
artificialities and distortions of the market, since
use value is produced as a derivative or precipitate of the market. “Use value has no autonomy,
it is only the satellite and alibi of exchange value,”
writes Baudrillard (1981, p. 139).
Nevertheless, despite the hostility toward a
central principle of Marxist analysis of culture,
Baudrillard still seems at this point to be trying
to revive and radicalize Marxist analysis rather
than to bury it. These works, as well as his next,
Symbolic Exchange and Death (1976, trans. 1993),
show the strain of trying to maintain an ideal
and a rhetoric of social critique while seemingly
undermining all of the values and principles
which might give such critique its point. If there
is no possibility of defining authentic human
needs and values under market conditions that
seem so totally to have abolished the distinction
between the authentic and the artificial, if, indeed,
that dream is a production of the very system
against which it seems to stand, then what kind
of critique is possible, and in the name of what
conceivable form of liberation? In some of the
essays dealing with the revolutionary spectacles
and events of May 1968 in For a Critique of the
Political Economy of the Sign, Baudrillard had
still seemed to glimpse some principle of resistance
to or refusal of what he calls grimly “the code.”
But the conclusion towards which he moves
inexorably in L’Echange symbolique et la mort
(1976) is that the system of symbolic exchange
at work in contemporary consumer society is
so all-encompassing that the only principle of

Baudrillard, Jean

`Baudrillard, Jean (1929–2007) 
Jean Baudrillard moved from being a sociologist of consumer society to being the most notorious and
immoderate of the thinkers associated with
Postmodernism. The account he develops of
contemporary mass culture and the mass media
is far-reaching and extravagant in its claims, and
has had an important influence across a number
of disciplines, especially Cultural studies,
Film, and Literary criticism. It would probably also be true to say that the very flamboyance
and hyperbole of Baudrillard’s writing, especially
from the 1980s onwards, which has brought him
in almost equal measure such widespread adulation and notoriety, has also prevented that work
from receiving the serious and sustained critical
attention which it deserves.
Baudrillard’s writing career began, like that
of many French theorists since the 1960s, with a
complex argument with Marxism, an argument
which is given particular impetus by the euphoria and defeat of the events of May 1968. The shape
of Baudrillard’s social theory is determined by the
trajectory of his disaffiliation from Marxism. In
a series of books which appeared between 1968
and 1973, Baudrillard undertakes to free social
analysis from the narrow determinism of a Marxism that reduced Culture to the secondary
effect of economic factors and relations. In Le
Système des Objects (1968) and La Société de
Consommation (1970), he argues that in a society organized on the principle of consumption
rather than production, the economic categories
of need, supply, distribution, and profit are
inadequate for analyzing the nature and function
of objects and commodities. Baudrillard maintains
that the circulation of material goods in late
twentieth-century developed economies is comprehensible only as the operation and diversification of linguistic codes. Baudrillard’s most
important contribution to the theory of consumer society is his insistence that consumption
has little to do with the satisfaction of needs,
actual or artificial. His argument is that Consumer Culture creates and sustains a universal
Code or System of exchangeability between
commodities. The desire of the consumer is not
for this or that object or element within the
code, but rather for inclusion within the system
of consumption as a whole. Such inclusion is a
potent means of social control, and is a wholly

Baudrillard, Jean

58
resistance lies in the destruction or negation
of all value or utility whatsoever. The only alternative value is the negation of value itself; such
that ultimately and in a political sense, highly
unpromisingly, the only challenge to the dominance of symbolic value is death. In this period
of his work, Baudrillard draws close to the extreme
political and aesthetic position associated with the
work of Georges Bataille, who similarly rejects
the principle of value as such.
From this point on, Baudrillard begins to
develop the theoretical analysis of the present
with which he has come to be most clearly
identified, the analysis of the regime of the simulacrum. The distance travelled in Baudrillard’s
analysis from his works of the 1970s may be
measured by a judgment offered in “The last
tango of value,” the final essay of his volume
Simulacres et Simulation (1981). There the institution of the university, which 13 years before
had seemed like the laboratory of new social
and political values, is now characterized as “the
site of a desperate initiation into the empty
form of value,” an obedient replication of that
emptying out of value into indifference which has
become the general condition of contemporary
culture.
The most influential of Baudrillard’s works
from the 1980s is the essay “The precession of
simulacra” from the same collection. There, he
suggests that the dominance of signs, images, and
representations in the contemporary world is
such that the real has been effectively obliterated,
and “truth, reference and objective causes have
ceased to exist” (Baudrillard, 1988, p. 168; n.b. this
translation of Baudrillard’s essay confusingly
gives it the title of the volume from which it
is derived, “Simulacra and simulations”). He
provides a useful, if slightly tongue-in-cheek
synopsis of the historical stages by which this
condition has been reached. Initially, the sign is
“the reflection of a basic reality. In the second stage,
the sign “masks and perverts a basic reality” (this
is perhaps the stage of Ideo-logy and manufactured false consciousness). In a third stage, the sign
“masks the absence of a basic reality.” In the
fourth stage, at which the contemporary world has
arrived, and from which it can hope neither to
progress nor retreat, the sign “bears no relation
to any reality whatever; it is its own pure simulacrum” (Baudrillard, 1988, p. 170).

Baudrillard’s argument is often misunderstood.
It is sometimes objected, for example, that the
disappearance of reality is scarcely something
that can constitute a historical event. Either the
real continues to exist, only masked and dissimulated beneath impenetrable layers of simulation, in which case Baudrillard’s claims about
its disappearance are merely rhetorical; or it has
never really existed, so that the developments
Baudrillard describes are really only the recognition that what counts as “real” is always dependent upon activities of representation. However,
these objections rest on an assumed absolute
contrast between the real and the fictive which it
is precisely the purpose of Baudrillard’s analysis to
contest. Central to that analysis is his provocative distinguishing of simulation from imitation.
If one imitates or counterfeits an illness, it may
be difficult, but not in principle impossible to
detect the fraud, for such imitation keeps the
distinction between the real and the false intact,
even as it masks it. But when an illness is simulated, as for example in certain hysterical or psychosomatic conditions, some of the symptoms
of the “actual” illness may indeed be produced in
the person of the simulator. In such a case, the
either/or logic of real and false, truth and deceit
is threatened. It is this condition which Baudrillard insists is that of the modern world. It is
not that everything has become purely fictional,
or without real effects, since the point about a
simulation is that it is both real and unreal (the
simulated illness is a simulation rather than an
imposture precisely because it does produce real
effects). The basis of Baudrillard’s argument is
therefore not shaken substantially by arguments
such as those of Christopher Norris, who pours
scorn on Baudrillard’s apparently lunatic prophecy in an article in The Guardian newspaper in
February 1991 that the Gulf War would not take
place, and his serene assurance in an article of the
following month that despite all bloody appearances, the Gulf War had not in fact taken place
(see Norris, 1993; Baudrillard, 1991). To argue
as Baudrillard did that the Gulf War was so
completely designed and executed as a media
spectacle that it could not be said to have taken
place as other wars have is not to argue that the
Gulf War was a simple fabrication (this is to fall
back into the real/false pattern of thinking which
Baudrillard claims is no longer adequate or even

59
declares to be impossible; as though a form of
theory and critique that denies itself the authority to speak on behalf of the truth continued to
assert an aesthetic principle of value in the transcendence or intensification of the real.

`Bazin, André (1918–58) 
André Bazin has
some claim to be one of the most influential
Western intellectuals of the twentieth century. The
magazine that he founded, Cahiers du cinema,
not only gave birth to the Nouvelle Vague – the
single most important movement of post-war
cinema – but also provided a vocabulary for
talking about the cinema that continues to be
used from Hollywood studios to experimental
art schools. However, Bazin died at the early age
of 40 in 1958 just before the 1960s explosion of
Parisian theory, and for a generation his work,
while always acknowledged as foundational for
film studies, has often been treated as theoretically naive. However, in the past decade there has
been a renewed surge of interest in Bazin and
it is likely that in the twenty-first century his
importance will continue to grow as the sophistication of his work, balancing technological,
industrial, and formal analyses of film within the
widest cultural and historical perspectives,
becomes more and more evident.
Bazin was a product of the French Third
Republic for whom education was a state ideology,
and after a youth spent in the French provinces
Bazin came to Paris in 1938 as a student at the

available). Rather it is to claim that it is simulation, precisely to the degree that the reproductive
technology which represented the war as a spectacle also was the war in actual fact (this was
instanced grotesquely in the guided missiles which
had cameras in their nose cones). A war that
consists largely of its own representation is no
longer a real war in the old sense, no matter how
ghastly its human consequences.
Perhaps the most telling part of Baudrillard’s
analysis of the effect of the waning of the sense
of reality in the age of the simulacrum is his
account of the “escalation of the true” which
takes place as a kind of panic-stricken compensation, “a proliferation of myths of origin and
signs of reality; of second-hand truth, objectivity
and authenticity” (Baudrillard, 1988, p. 171).
The desire to believe in what is natural, primitive,
“real,” or otherwise beyond the reach of reproductive or simulacral technologies is heightened
by the awareness of the fading of such unfalsifiable truth. Paradoxically, this very desire can
only express itself through more energetic acts of
simulation than ever before. The false feeds the
dream of the true, which can appear only as the
“hyperreal” or simulated true.
Baudrillard develops an impressive array of
terms and metaphors, many of them drawn from
science fiction, to dramatize the grim fascination
of appearances in the contemporary world. He has
construed the world in biological terms, as the
operationalization of codes and models, just as
every embodied form is an operationalization
of the DNA which precedes and determines it.
Elsewhere, he speaks of the “satellization” of the
world, to convey the idea that the world has
been reassembled as a perfect replica, and put into
orbit around itself. Military metaphors also feature, in so far as modern military strategy seems
a perfect exemplification of much of his argument:
the world of appearance and reproduction is
said to be a kind of “deterrence” of the real.
Baudrillard devotes a whole book to an analysis
of the effect of “seduction” which he claims signs
and images exercise in the modern world (1979).
The overheated multiplication of these images
and devices in the restless proliferation of brilliant
analyses that Baudrillard continued to conduct of
different areas of contemporary art and culture
almost seems like a secret enactment of the
principle of resistance that his analysis coolly

prestigious École Normale Superieure at St Cloud
to train as a teacher. There is no doubt that
Bazin always thought of himself first and foremost
as a teacher, but his educational efforts took
place completely outside the state educational
system. There is a simple explanation for this:
in 1941 he failed a crucial exam because of his
stammer. However, such failures were, and are,
common in the French system, even at the most
elite level, and the normal course of action would
simply have been to retake the exam. Bazin, however, chose to interpret this setback as the sign that
he must seek his vocation independently of the
state. There is no doubt that this choice was
in considerable measure due to the generalized
disgust that Bazin, like so many others of his
generation, felt for the institutions of the French
state after the French capitulation to the Germans
in the summer of 1940 and the establishment of
the Vichy government of Petain.
Before 1940 Bazin’s engagement with film was
simply a part of his extraordinary range of
interests: from geology to zoology, from recent
American fiction to the German Phenomenology that was to have such an impact in France
through the work of Sartre. But he was predisposed to take film more seriously than many
intellectuals because of his attachment to the
journal Esprit, of which he was an avid reader when
he came as a student to Paris and to which he
became an important contributor right up to
his death. Esprit was a Catholic journal of the
non-Communist left and it included among its
contributors the film maker and critic Roger
Leenhardt. Leenhardt was one of the few intellectuals to welcome the advent of sound. For
many sound spelt the death of an intellectual
commitment to cinema, ending the dream of a
universal language that would transcend national
tongues and increasing the cost of production
beyond the means of individuals. For Leenhardt,
however, sound signaled a massive gain in film’s
ability to capture reality and it is this capturing
of reality that, for Leenhardt, is the essence of
cinema. Leenhardt also had an educational project – to teach cinemagoers enough about the technical aspects of cinema that they could become
better critics – and, in the late 1930s, Esprit carried
five articles that began this critical introduction
to the cinema. In many ways Leenhardt sketched
the program that Bazin was to implement.

Theoretically Bazin was to develop an account
of the cinema that located its realist aesthetic in
the fundamental technology of the camera. In
perhaps his single most important essay, “The
Ontology of the Photographic Image,” published
in 1944, Bazin argued that the invention of
photography was the most important event in the
history of the plastic arts. Before photography, the
plastic arts had always attempted a realism that
was inevitably deficient as it was dependent on the
subjectivity of the artist. The camera’s image was
produced mechanically and chemically without any
subjective element. The object photographed
was, thus, directly related to the object represented
in the photograph. In Pierce’s terms the relation
between object and representation in the photograph is indexical – there is a causal relation
between the one and the other.
Few of Bazin’s writings are as purely theoretical as this early essay but the commitment to
realism is a constant of his writing. Later critics
such as Jean-Luc Godard and Serge Daney argued
strongly that while retaining Bazin’s commitment
to the realism of the image, it was important to
recognize that the placing of the camera always
involved a subjective element. The camera did
not record any object, it recorded the objects on
which it was focused. If Bazin does not articulate
this position theoretically, it is crucial to recognize that in his critical writings of the immediate
postwar years, the realist aesthetic that he elaborates is very far from a simple empiricism because
both camera and object are articulated within
complex and contradictory histories. Bazin’s two
great directors are Orson Welles and Roberto
Rossellini and the two key films Citizen Kane
and Paisa. It is important to recognize how
different are the realisms of these two directors.
Kane marks a decisive step in the realism of
the cinema because of its use of new lenses that
allow Welles and his cinematographer Gregg
Toland to capture a much greater depth of field
in which competing centers of narrative interest
can be watched at the same time. The new
“deep” images allow Welles to portray a more
complex reality and free the spectators to choose
where to direct their visual attention within the
image. Rossellini’s gain in realism is not technological but social: he amalgamates fiction and
reality, above all by his use of non-professional
actors. The streets of the towns and cities of

61
contradictions of the movements of history. At this
point Bazin had isolated himself not only from
the academic world, for whom all film was
simply an indication of the poverty of modern culture, but also from the Communist left, which
regarded all American films as anathema. It was
from this position of political and cultural isolation that Bazin decided to found a film magazine
with the name Les Cahiers du cinema. If he could
no longer educate cinema’s vast popular audiences
directly then he would, in his own words, retreat
to the cafes of the Left Bank and educate the next
generation of critics and thus carry out his
cultural program at one remove. Rarely can any
cultural enterprise have been so successful. A
whole host of young critics began their careers
writing in the pages of Cahiers in the 1950s,
critics who were to become famous as directors
themselves: Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard,
Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, and François
Truffaut. It was these critics who were to elaborate the auteur theory that continues to dominate
much critical and commercial discourse about the
cinema and who were to establish a canon of
Hollywood directors that remains little altered
to this day. In 1959 Godard was to sum up the
cultural battles of the previous decade: “We won
the day in having it acknowledged in principle that
a film by Hitchcock for example is as important
as a book by Aragon. Film auteurs thanks to us
have finally entered the history of art.”
By the time of Godard’s victorious pronouncement Bazin was dead. Ill health had dogged him
all his life and he finally succumbed to leukemia
on the very day that François Truffaut finished
the first day’s shooting on his debut feature Les
Quatre Cent Coups. Of all the “young Turks”
who wrote in the pages of Cahiers, it was
Truffaut who was the closest to Bazin. Bazin
had encountered Truffaut as a film-mad juvenile
delinquent with a desperately unhappy home
life, and it was Bazin who had taken him into his
own home and treated him as his own son.
There is something almost mystical in the coincidence that has Truffaut rushing from his first
day’s shooting to the deathbed of the critic who
had done so much to enable a new generation to
undertake a new kind of film-making.
In the immediate decades after his death
Bazin suffered something of an eclipse. Not only
was his work scorned by the theoreticians but

Bazin, André

Paisa are so vivid because the figures that inhabit
them are not actors but the men, women, and
children who are living through the dreadful
realities of postwar Italy. If we consider these
two examples we can understand that for Bazin
both camera (technological history) and setting
(social history) are a continuously variable conjunction, and the audience for which the film is
projected is a yet further element that critics
must build into their analyses.
Few critics have ever addressed so many
and so varied audiences as Bazin. From the
Liberation to his death Bazin earned his living by
writing for mass circulation newspapers and it is
important to understand this regular discipline as
an important part of his formation as a critic. More
important, in the immediate postwar years, he ran
a variety of cine-clubs, some addressed to the
intellectual elite of Left Bank Paris – Sartre and
de Beauvoir were regular visitors – but others
engaging vast popular audiences from Morocco
to Germany. There is no doubt that the most
important organization for which Bazin worked
at this time was Travail et Culture, which sought
to provide the best cultural entertainment for
working class audiences. In Travail et Culture
Bazin could pursue his fundamental cultural
ambition – to produce a better cinema by educating audiences in the history and technology
of the cinema. These educated audiences would
then demand a better cinema. However, the high
hopes of the immediate postwar era broke
against the rocks of the emerging Cold War as
everyone inside organizations like Travail et
Culture was required to choose sides – for or
against the Soviet Union. The choice was particularly acute for anyone interested in the cinema.
Hollywood was in the last phase of its classic
period, producing masterpieces by the week,
while Soviet cinema had declined from the great
period of the 1920s into the most slavish adulation of Stalin. To be on the Communist left one
had to denounce these Hollywood classics and
praise banal Stalinist propaganda.
This was impossible for Bazin and in l950
in Esprit he published an article entitled “The
Myth of Stalin” in which he demonstrated that
the representation of history in the films of
the Stalinist era was completely at odds with the
great Soviet films of the 1920s, substituting a
mythic “great mind” for the complexities and

Beauvoir, Simone de

62
the position of the critic, so key to Bazin’s
program, was fundamentally altered as the
studios adopted huge platform releases in which
the opinions of individual critics were of no
account. However, Bazin’s work is much more
theoretically sophisticated than his critics have
suggested and it is now engaging a new generation of more historically informed theorists.
Some have suggested that the arrival of the
digital image undermines Bazin’s fundamental
axiom of the indexical relation between object
and representation. However, if it is true that
it is possible to produce non-indexical digital
images, it is also true that the vast majority of
digital images continue to acquire their power
from their indexical relation to reality. Finally,
as the number of platforms for visual images
proliferate the role of the critic/curator looks set
to become ever more important. Bazin’s work
remains full of lessons for the present and he
has yet to find any challenger for the title of the
single greatest writer on the cinema.

`Beauvoir, Simone de (1908–86) 
French
philosopher and novelist. Simone de Beauvoir
was a pioneering feminist philosopher who has
been justly called “the emblematic intellectual
woman of the twentieth century” (Moi, 1994,
p. 1). Her reputation, which is secure virtually
everywhere but in France, rests largely on her
prolific work as a writer and social activist. Her
more than 25 books include works of philosophy:
Pyrrhus et Cineas (1944), The Ethics of Ambiguity
(1947), The Second Sex (1949); fiction: She Came
to Stay (1943), The Mandarins (1954), The
Woman Destroyed (1968); and memoirs: Memoirs
of a Dutiful Daughter (1958), The Prime of Life
(1960), Force of Circumstance (1963), All Said
and Done (1972).
Although she was unable to enter the Ecole
Normale Supérieure, which did not grant full

student status to women until 1927, Beauvoir
first studied mathematics, classics, and literature,
and then in 1929 passed the prestigious agrégation examination at the Sorbonne in philosophy.
She was only the ninth woman ever to have
passed that examination in philosophy and the
youngest agrégée (man or woman) ever in that
discipline. Furthermore, she received the second
highest mark, the first that year going to Jean-Paul
Sartre, with whom she was to have a lifelong
relationship. Despite the many obstacles she had
to overcome or to circumvent in order to do
philosophy and be an intellectual woman, it was
not until 1946, in a conversation with Sartre,
that she was fully struck by the consequences
of the difference between being born a woman
and being born a man. This realization led her to
give full attention to finding out about the condition of woman in its broadest terms (Beauvoir,
1963, p. 103). The result of this search was her
most influential book, The Second Sex, which
echoes the opening words of Rousseau’s Social
Contract, in its proclamation of the birth of the
free woman.
Throughout the 1950s, The Second Sex was
the only book by an intellectual woman that
exposed the hypocrisies of patriarchal Ideology
(for an account of the book’s reception, see
Moi, 1994, pp. 179–213). However, as soon as
the first installments of The Second Sex began
to appear in Les Temps Modernes in 1948/9, the
French intellectual establishment, including
Albert Camus and François Mauriac, launched a
series of outraged attacks on its author. Beauvoir
recalled the hysteria of many of her first French
readers in Force of Circumstance: “Unsatisfied,
cold, priapic, nymphomaniac, lesbian, a hundred times aborted, I was everything, even an
unmarried mother. People offered to cure me of
my frigidity or to satisfy my ghoulish appetites”
(Beauvoir, 1963, p. 197). Despite the moral
courage and intellectual achievement of her
book, Beauvoir has been either ignored or vehemently dismissed by such prominent French
feminists as Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, and
Hélène Cixous. An important recent exception
to this treatment is the work of Michèle Le
Dœuff, who in Hipparchia’s Choice demonstrates
the importance of The Second Sex as simultaneously a work of materialist feminism and philosophical critique.

American

a significant influence on Cultural theory in
two areas. His initial research on jazz clubs and
musicians, published as Outsiders (1963), was
central to 1960s deviant theory and had a major
impact on British studies of both Subculture
and Popular culture (Becker was one of the few
academics to study popular music). And in his

`Benjamin, Walter (1892–40) 
GermanJewish philosopher and literary critic. He committed suicide while attempting to cross from
occupied France into Spain on his way to
America. Probably the most important European
theorist of Culture this century; certainly the
most important to identify with the Marxist
tradition. Benjamin’s writings display an extraordinary range of interests, often combining
what at first sight appear to be eccentric and incompatible approaches to their objects. They are
resolutely cross-disciplinary, and as concerned
with what were then the latest cultural technologies (photography, film, radio) as they are with
both the classical forms of bourgeois culture
(drama, Poetry, the novel) and its more neglected marginalia (such as nineteenth-century
children’s books and toys).
Benjamin’s writings are associated with the
theoretical combination of materialist and
theological perspectives. Thus, while his work

may in some respects be seen as a forerunner of
the omnivorous pluralism of Cultural studies,
in others it belongs to a different world entirely
– the world of 1920s Jewish Marxism with its
subtle meditations on the inextricability of truth
and history.
This diversity of perspectives and concerns
has produced a number of competing schools
of interpretation, each with its own distinctive
“Benjamin,” between which there has been
heated debate: Benjamin the Critic, Benjamin
the Marxist, Benjamin the Modernist, Benjamin
the Jew. These disputes are complicated by the
fact that Benjamin’s thought developed through
a series of distinct phases, marked by close
personal relationships with other thinkers (in
particular, Scholem, Adorno, and Brecht). Ideas
from earlier periods were never wholly rejected,
but subjected to a continual and unfinished
process of recasting.
The key to the continuity of this process lies
in Benjamin’s distinction between immediate,
everyday experience (Erlebnis) and authentic or
philosophical experience (Erfahrung). The practical goal of all Benjamin’s work was to transform
everyday experience into the experience of truth:
to seek out the ecstatic within the everyday, to find
“history” within the merely historical, in order
to recover the repressed energies of the past for
the construction of a better future. In this almost
Manichean polarization of forms of experience,
Benjamin’s writings may be compared to the
other great philosophical work of Weimar culture,
Heidegger’s Being and Time (1927), with its
central distinction between “authentic” and
“inauthentic” existence. However, despite this
structural parallel, Benjamin’s work stands
opposed to Heidegger’s in almost every other
respect, both theoretically and politically.
Benjamin’s concern throughout the 1930s with the
interconnected themes of Art, truth, and history
constitutes a direct reply to Heidegger’s work:
the counterposition of a revolutionary Marxist
philosophy of historical time to the philosophy
of time and “Being” of the conservative revolution of German fascism.
The best way to chart the continuities and
ruptures in Benjamin’s thinking is to follow the
changes in his conception of truth. This delineates
a path from an early Romantic aestheticism,
associated with a programmatic rejection of

politics, to a theologically enriched historical
materialism of cultural forms, in solidarity with
a left-wing communism, via the “profane illumination” of “Surrealist experience” (Benjamin,
1929). Benjamin’s thought developed under the
cumulative impact of a series of models of
cultural experience – Proust, Kafka, Baudelaire,
Brecht (Benjamin, 1968) – which were constantly reworked to provide the terms of a
Marxist theory of Modernity. But it is surrealism which is the key to the practical hopes of
Benjamin’s later writings.
Son of a well-to-do Jewish businessman who
had made his money as an art dealer, Benjamin
began his intellectual career at the University
of Freiburg in the years immediately preceding
the 1914–18 war with a dual rejection: intellectual rejection of the Neo-Kantianism then
dominant in the academy in favor of a esoteric
metaphysics of values; political rejection of the
values of Wilhelminian society (what he later
called “the abyss of my own class”), in favor
of the anarchic radicalism of the Free Student
Movement. An important, if little studied work
from this period is entitled “Metaphysics of
youth” (Benjamin, 1913). At the same time,
Benjamin committed himself to a type of cultural
Zionism that was resolutely internationalist.
Judaism was understood as the representative of
spiritual values per se, rather than the basis for
any kind of nationally specific project. His early
writings include an esoteric philosophy of
Language, centered on a biblical theory of
naming, and an interrogation of the “mystical
premises” of the early Romantic concept of criticism, in which he claims that “the very centre of
Romanticism” is its Messianism.
At this stage, Benjamin’s project was to expand
to infinity the range of philosophical experience
and to comprehend such experience on the model
of the experience of the work of art. Criticism was
the key to such comprehension since, according
to Benjamin, it is criticism which “completes” the
work. Developing from his doctoral dissertation
on The Concept of Art Criticism in German
Romanticism (1919), Benjamin’s essay on
Goethe’s Elective Affinities (1923) elaborates a
systematic critique of the Symbol as the cognitive structure of the work of art, identifying
truth with allegory and the absence of expression.
(The polemical force of this argument in the

context of expressionism is clear.) At this point,
Benjamin understood truth as a quasi-Platonic
realm of ideas, represented by works of art, but
recoverable as experience only through the
philosophical criticism of art.
This theory achieves its final form in the difficult Prologue to Benjamin’s Habilitation, the
higher degree required for a tenured position
in a German university, The Origin of German
Trauerspiel (Benjamin, 1928a). (Trauerspiel means
“sorrow play.” It is a little-studied baroque genre
which Benjamin distinguished in principle from
classical Tragedy.) The reception of this work –
it was withdrawn to avoid formal rejection by the
University of Frankfurt – led to the abrupt
termination of the academic phase of Benjamin’s
life. Henceforth he would earn his living from
journalism and take his motivation from politics,
although he never became a member of the
German Communist Party, with which he
sympathized.
In leaving the academy for politics and the
press, Benjamin abandoned the esoteric aspirations
of his early work, replacing them with reflection
on the historical conditions of its failure, in the
form of a theorization of Modernity as the
destruction of tradition. It is this theorization,
embodied in the developing frame of Benjamin’s
critical essays, which constitutes his most enduring contribution to Cultural theory. It
derived its inspiration from the cultural and
political Avant-garde of West Berlin, but it
includes among its resources materials from the
very tradition it rejects as beyond recuperation:
the mystical tradition of Jewish Messianism, as
recovered by Gershom Scholem, Benjamin’s
friend from before the 1914–18 war.
Benjamin’s mature work is a sustained reflection on the contradictory relations between
modernity and tradition, in which a variety of
cultural forms are subjected to historical interpretation within the terms of a philosophy of history which draws on the Marxist and Messianic
traditions alike. Yet Benjamin is far from being
an eclectic thinker. Rather, once he grasped the
depth of what he called the “crisis in the arts” as
symptomatic of a crisis in the very form of historical time (tradition) upon which the work of
art depends for its social existence, he saw that
the question of truth had been displaced by history from art onto the historical process itself.

65
model for such writing – alternating between
writing and action – was the film.
“All the problems of contemporary art,”
Benjamin wrote in his massive unfinished work
on nineteenth-century Paris, the Arcades Project,
“find their final formulation only in relation to
film” (Benjamin, 1972, V). To understand this
statement, one needs to appreciate the depth to
which Benjamin understood all forms of cultural
experience as having been transformed by technology and commodification (Benjamin, 1936).
In its inherent “reproducibility,” culture in
twentieth-century capitalist societies distinguishes
itself from all previous artistic forms, and contains
a potentially progressive collective content. At
the same time, however, this content is imprisoned within the fetish character of the commodity form, which cuts off the experience of the work
from an appreciation of the social processes
through which it is produced, received, and
transmitted to future generations.
Benjamin took Brecht’s epic theater as the
model for an artistic practice which would
combat this tendency toward self-enclosure by
making the exposure of the conditions for the
production of the work a part of the work itself.
In this vein, he developed the idea of the author
as a “producer,” on the model of Marx’s analysis of the labor process (Benjamin, 1934).
On the other hand, Benjamin set himself
apart from other Marxist theorists of culture by
refusing to dismiss the commodity form merely
as a realm of false consciousness. Instead, he
attempted its “dialectical redemption” as a form
of historical consciousness by seeking, through
its fetish character, access to a new (allegorical)
form of experience of history as a fulfilled whole.
The light cast by this essentially instantaneous
experience of history as a whole – for which
Benjamin used the term Jetztzeit, meaning
“now-time” – is taken to reveal the present as
unfulfilled, and thereby to provide an impulse to
its radical transformation. The anarchic libertarianism of Benjamin’s youth is thus reproduced in
his mature theory in the explosive structure of the
Messianic “now,” although this is only the best
known of a series of models of historical experience to be found in his later writings. (Benjamin
did not intend his thesis “On the concept of
history” to be published. In fact, he explicitly
anticipated its miscomprehension.)

Benjamin, Walter

History becomes the whole to which experience
must be related if it is to become an experience
of truth.
It is at this point that the mystical motifs of
Jewish Messianism reenter the picture, with their
totalizing sense of redemption, not as an event
within history, but of history, as a whole. In
opposition to both the peremptory teleology of
Hegelianism and the complacent chronologism
of Ranke’s Historicism, Jewish Messianism
offered Benjamin a structure of thought in
which to think of history as a whole, while still
maintaining the openness of the present to political action. The explosive tension of the later
work, manifest most clearly in the famous thesis
“On the concept of history” (Benjamin, 1940), is
generated by the attempt to render such thought
consistent with historical Materialism under
rapidly degenerating political conditions. This
project took the form of a critique of the concept
of progress.
It is this aspect of Benjamin’s work – a
philosophy of history which is utopian and
pessimistic in equal measure – which exerted
most influence on the Frankfurt school. In
Benjamin’s own case, it led to the redefinition of
historiography from a type of science to a form
of remembrance (Eingedenken), in active opposition to the “forgetting” taken to suffuse the
historical time-consciousness of modernity.
One-Way Street (1928), in which the new perspective emerges for the first time with all the force
and excitement of “the new,” is one of the great
works of the Weimar avant-garde. “Significant
literary work,” it declares in the first of its series
of fragments, “can only come into being in a strict
alternation between writing and action; it must
nurture the inconspicuous forms that better fit
its influence in active communities than does the
pretentious, universal gesture of the book – in
leaflets, brochures, articles, and placards. Only this
prompt language shows itself actively equal to the
moment.” Benjamin’s production would henceforth be fagmentary and essayistic, not merely out
of financial necessity, but also as a matter of
joint aesthetic and political principle. In the slipstream of surrealism, Benjamin endowed what
Ernst Bloch called his “feel for the peripheral”
with the weightiest claims of the philosophical
tradition. In the process, he produced some of the
most powerful critical writing of the century. His

In the combination of a refusal to dismiss
the commodity form as mere false consciousness
with an interest in its character as representation
and object of fantasy, Benjamin is taken by some
to have anticipated the affirmative attitude
towards commodification characteristic of Postmodernism. Yet it is important to distinguish
Benjamin’s Marxist concept of phantasmagoria
(the interpretation of the world of commodities
as a dream-world), in principle, from such notions
of Baudrillard’s as simulation and hyperreality, since Benjamin remained committed to a
metaphysical conception of the objectivity of
truth. Indeed, his entire oeuvre revolves around
one. In this respect, he is better viewed as a
baroque or even a gothic Marxist (Cohen, 1993)
than any kind of postmodernist avant la lettre.

`Benveniste, Emile (1902–76) 
French linguist. Benveniste is best known for his creative combination of historical linguistics with
Structuralism, which extended linguistics into
Cultural theory. His best-known works are
Problems of General Linguistics (1966) and IndoEuropean Language and Society (1969). One of
his most influential arguments is his qualified
disagreement with Ferdinand de Saussure’s
principle that the nature of the linguistic Sign is

arbitrary. By focusing much of his attention on
the speaker of language, Benveniste resisted the
tendency in linguistics to treat language as
simply a formal System. In this respect, his work
had a significant impact on Julia Kristeva’s
Semiotics and her efforts to close the gap
between linguistics and Psychoanalysis.

`Bernstein, Leonard (1918–90) 
Musician,
born in Lawrence, Massachusetts. One of the
first US-born musicians to gain international
esteem and reputation, essentially by means of
his conducting. At the age of 40 he became the
youngest music director hired by the New York
Philharmonic Orchestra. Throughout his life he
was guest conducter to the major orchestras of the
world and recorded hundreds of performances,
especially with the Vienna, Israel, and New York
Philharmonics. His talents and creative endeavors
were extensive in other areas as well, including
the composition of symphonic music, Broadway
musicals, ballets, songs, film and theatre scores.
He made pioneering efforts in music education,
much of which is found in his extremely popular
and influential work in television (most notably
his Omnibus programs and Young People’s
Concerts). His influence on others was extensive
and his lasting work ranged from composer and
conductor to pianist and scholar.
Bernstein’s philosophical and cultural reflections can be found in numerous lectures, essays,
correspondences, and critical musical studies.
(Some of these are in his popular texts: The Joy
of Music, 1959; The Infinite Variety of Music,
1966, and Findings, 1982; while others, including
many of his public lectures and television scripts
and presentations, are only now being published
and made readily available.) The principal text,
however, that unifies and situates Bernstein’s
work is his Harvard lectures of 1973, the Charles
Eliot Norton Lectures, entitled The Unanswered

67
requires a studied and holistic reading of The
Unanswered Question to be truly appreciated.
However, there is another way to come to recognize this perspective of Bernstein. The problem
of how to speak to others about those things we
have deeply studied and investigated continually
concerned Bernstein. The Norton Lectures again
and again ask: “Who is the audience?” “To whom
am I speaking?” “How am I to make myself
understood?” This concern was of immense
importance when Bernstein thought about how
to speak to “laymen,” to a nondiscipline-specific
audience, about music. He had no tolerance for
the “music appreciation racket” as he sometimes
called it, but he was well aware that a technical,
discipline-bound discussion would fall flat and be
of little interest to all but a few. So how is one to
speak to others (about this or anything else)?
Bernstein believed that he could do so only by
investigating himself: by uncovering those ingredients and characteristics of a musical subject,
or a musical composition, which were exciting to
him and spoke to him personally. Investigations
of the self can give us something to say, for we
find in ourselves a possible common bond with
others. These revealed feelings and findings are
then expressed, with the help of interdisciplinary
methods and examples, in standard, ordinary
language, in that everyday language we all share.
Importantly, for Bernstein, investigations of
the self allow us to ask the perfectly ordinary
questions: “Don’t you feel as I feel?” “Don’t you
find in yourself the same experiences I find?”
(Such questions were asked again and again in
Bernstein’s writings.) Our meaningful attempts to
communicate with others must come from careful pursuits of self-knowledge expressed in the
form of personal confession and feelings. (It is this
devotion to study and expression of himself that
made Bernstein’s attempt to communicate with
others so successful, whether it be Young People’s
Concerts, performances of Mahler, or investigations of negation and death in the Norton
Lectures.) In his pursuit of himself Bernstein
found others and his common bond with others.
Bernstein found the question of the nature of
music closely tied to the question of the nature
of the twentieth century. Both face crises of
being that, when investigated, shed light on the
inevitable crisis of self. When examining the
twentieth-century crisis in music, in the Norton

Bernstein, Leonard

Question (published in 1976). It is there that
we find a direct and sustained attempt to understand the variety of questions and themes that
pervaded Bernstein’s life in all of its forms,
including the nature of music, the human craving for universality, the problem of negation, the
challenge to the musical perspectives of Theodor
Adorno, the introduction of interdisciplinary
study to the intellectual and popular communities, and the value of personal exploration and
expression of self.
Standing behind everything scholarly Bernstein
did is his devotion to and expression of interdisciplinary study. When discussing his student
days at Harvard and specifically his philosophical studies, Bernstein says, “the principal thing
I absorbed from Professor Prall [his philosophy
professor], and from Harvard in general, was
a sense of interdisciplinary value – that the best
way to ‘know’ a thing is in the context of another
discipline.” It is this epistemological interest in
knowing one thing by means of the context of
something else that guides and provides the
method for much of Bernstein’s work. In his
attempts to understand music, for example, he sets
it side by side with disciplines and concerns such
as linguistics (Chomsky), poetry (Eliot), physics
(laws of sound), anthropological speculations
about origins (Rousseau, Schopenhauer), and philosophy (Existentialism). His reason for such
a method is a belief that it will lead not only to
a better perspective on the nature of music or any
discipline so investigated, but just as importantly
to an improved understanding of the self, of
the human creature who creates and lives such
a disciplined existence. Interdisciplinary study is
finally, for Bernstein, an expression of the self and
being we all share; an investigation of that (nonprivate) being we have in common with others.
This expression of a common being reflects
Bernstein’s efforts to exhibit the human craving
(his own craving) for universal grounding of our
being. Interdisciplinary attempts at understanding music are exemplary of other attempts at
finding the universal grounding and impulses of
any inquiry, music being one example of an
expression of common human beingness. For
Bernstein, the pursuit of our personal feelings and
the expressions, the deeply confessional expressions, of these feelings reveal our shared being, and
universal connection, with others. This claim

Lectures, one of Bernstein’s central antagonists
is Theodor Adorno, specifically Adorno’s text, The
Philosophy of Modern Music (1948). Bernstein’s discussion throughout these lectures can be usefully
read, as aspiring to be read, as an antithesis to
Adorno’s text. Many similar topics are discussed
in the two: neoclassicism, music about music,
the origins of tonality, subjectivity and objectivity, sincerity and inauthenticity. But whereas
Adorno sees the crisis, represented in the compositions of Schoenberg and Stravinsky, in fairly
stark terms, as a choice between good and evil,
progress and stagnation, Bernstein sees both
Stravinsky and Schoenberg searching for the
same thing, just in different ways. They share the
same motivation: increased expressive power.
Bernstein believes the difficulties expressed in
twentieth-century music are more complex
than Adorno allows, and that Adorno simply
misreads Stravinsky and lacks sufficient literary
appreciation for what Stravinsky does. Irony,
humor, literary indirections all escape the narrow
and dogmatic approach taken by Adorno.
In his Norton Lectures, Bernstein attempts
to confront honestly and nondogmatically, in
broad interdisciplinary ways, the disappointments, negations, and threats of nihilism that
confront him in the century his life spans (the century of death, as he calls it). The self-confidence
exhibited at the beginning of the twentieth century is shattered, and a crisis of self and questioning
of one’s self follows. Bernstein tries to understand
this crisis of self through questions about the
nature of music, which as a discipline faces a
similar crisis and search. Ultimately both face
the reality of death. Nevertheless, even in the
face of this great negation of being, humans still
create and struggle to express themselves. For
Bernstein, musical expression shows the human
desire to affirm human life and creativity directly
in the face of nihilism and death. What more
positive expression of our common being can there
be, asks Bernstein, than such an impulse? It is such
extreme passion and existential affirmation that
pervades Bernstein’s work and writing, and few
have missed it. However, without an understanding of the scholarly work and methods that
surround these characteristics we miss much of
his real depth and value as a teacher, composer,
and conductor.

`biblical studies 
One of the most important
and most controversial developments in biblical
studies during the past 20 years has been the
influence of literary and Critical theory on
the understanding of biblical Texts, the circumstances of their composition, and the history
of their interpretation. Myth criticism, feminist
theory, Semiotics, Structuralism, Deconstruction, Reader-response criticism have
all been employed in readings of individual texts,
as well as in an attempt to understand Hebrew
Scripture, the New Testament, and the Old and
New Testaments as a whole. Although Stephen D.
Moore has demonstrated that “literary criticism
has been a component of biblical criticism
almost since its inception” (1989, p. xv), the dismissive phrase “the Bible as literature” has been
often used defensively against biblical scholarship
that draws on theories and practices of Literary
criticism. This has only partly been the consequence of an opposition between secular literary
scholars and practicing Jews and Christians. It
has also been the result of a theoretical clash
between formalist literary critics determined to find
aesthetic unity in every text and textual scholars
whose documentary hypothesis leads them to
see the Bible as a mosaic of texts composed at
different times but later edited into a not quite
seamless whole (see Gros Louis, 1982, pp. 13–
34). Matthew Arnold set out the terms of this
controversy in God and the Bible, when he wrote,
“the language of the Bible is not scientific, but
literary. That is, it is the language of poetry and
emotion, approximate language thrown out, as it
were, at certain great objects which the human
mind augurs and feels after, and thrown out by
men very liable, many of them to delusion and
error” (1978, p. 228).

69
questions about the functional structure of
narrative and to examine carefully the transaction
between narrator and audience that produces
the Bible’s strategic effects. The methods of the
New criticism must, however, be supplemented
by communication theory (or the rhetoric of
fiction) and by Reader-response criticism to
produce a method that begins to be adequate for
biblical study.
To offer a poetics of biblical narrative is to claim
that biblical narrative is a work of literature.
Not just an artful work; not a work marked by
some aesthetic property; not a work resorting
to so-called literary devices; not a work that the
interpreter may choose (or refuse) to consider
from a literary viewpoint . . . but a literary work.
(Sternberg, 1985, p. 2)

Biblical scholars ignorant of the complexities
of modern literary criticism misleadingly refer to
“the literary approach,” as though literary studies
were monolithic. Instead, Sternberg argues, the
study of the Bible by those who see it as a literary work will necessarily generate a new poetics
of literature as a whole, enlarging biblical and
literary studies at the same time. In this respect,
his argument converges with Frye’s.
The essence of Sternberg’s thesis is that the ideological, historical, and aesthetic dimensions of
the Bible invite a dynamic response from those
who work carefully with the text, a response
in which reading becomes a dramatic act. The
“ideological imperative” of scripture, in his view,
is the celebration of God’s mastery over creation,
which takes the form of “the shift of ground
from existence to epistemology” (p. 46). The
crucial link between omniscient narrative form
and theological content is that throughout the
Bible God’s omniscience is displayed against the
background of man’s limitations. Such a contrast
between the divine and the human gives rise to
the longing for a historical vision of sufficient
power to place the facts of limited human experience within a panoramic, coherent context
that can make the past retrospectively present in
human consciousness. At the same time that the
ideological dimension of the Bible gives rise to
an aesthetic preference for omniscient narration
consistent with the view of God’s mastery, its

biblical studies

Northrop Frye, while acknowledging openly his
debt to Vico rather than perhaps a more profound
one to Arnold, began a preliminary series of
maps of the Bible’s literary landscape, extending
through seven phases of revelation that link the
Old Testament (or Hebrew Bible) with the New
Testament. (Frye also had to work under the
shadow of T.S. Eliot’s condemnation of the
literary study of the Bible in his essay “Religion
and literature:” “The fact that men of letters now
discuss [the Bible] as ‘literature’ probably indicates
the end of its ‘literary’ influence” (Eliot, 1960,
p. 344)). In such books as Anatomy of Criticism
(1957), Creation and Recreation (1980), and
The Great Code: The Bible and Literature (1982),
Frye provided the most comprehensive literary
theoretical study of the Bible yet published. His
discussion of typology within and between the Old
and New Testaments is the key to Frye’s view of
the Bible and the poetics of its historiography.
Typological reading sees an earlier story (the
typos) as completed by – and achieving its meaning from – a later one (the antitypos). Cain and
Abel by Jacob and Esau, Moses by Jesus, Jesus by
Paul. An inescapable consequence of typological
reading, however, is the cultural appropriation
of what comes early (in the text or in history) by
what comes later. Thus, the New Testament
could be typologically read as the definitive antitype to the Old, and Jewish culture as merely a
prologue to Christianity.
In The Poetics of Biblical Narrative (1985)
Meir Sternberg does not condescend to mention
Frye (perhaps as a consequence of Frye’s typologies) even in the context of his many arguments
with other literary critics of the Bible. Sternberg’s
ambitious book, which was the first volume in
the Indiana Literary Biblical Series, uses modern
literary criticism to illuminate the surface and
the depths of biblical narrative, while it also
turns scriptural texts back on literary criticism in
an attempt to correct and augment the practices
of literary theorists. Sternberg believes that,
while literary critics can contribute significantly
to biblical study, they also will receive from the
Bible beneficial instruction in the techniques of
narrative and the ways to interpret it. The Bible
thus generates its own Narratology.
Critics are more likely than other students of
the Bible, Sternberg suggests, to pose fundamental

biblical studies

70
historical dimension renders in realistic detail
the intractable imperfection of human beings.
Finally, the experience of reading the Bible casts
“interpretation as an ordeal that enacts and distinguishes the human predicament” (p. 46) of
limitation that reaches out to an infinite divinity,
leading the reader to fresh or renewed understanding of divine and human creativity.
Sternberg’s biblical criticism, much of it
originally written in Hebrew, came to the attention of most Western readers through Robert
Alter’s generous citations in The Art of Biblical
Narrative (1981). The following pastiche of
quotations from Alter indicates the similarity
between his and Sternberg’s critical practices:
It is important to move from the analysis of
formal structures to a deeper understanding of
the values, the moral vision embodied in a
particular kind of narrative. . . . Meaning, perhaps
for the first time in narrative literature, was conceived as a process, requiring continual revision
– both in the ordinary sense and in the etymological sense of seeing-again – continual
suspension of judgment, weighing of multiple
possibilities, brooding over gaps in the information provided . . . The implicit theology of the
Hebrew Bible dictates a complex moral and psychological realism in biblical narrative because
God’s purposes are always entrammeled in history, dependent on the acts of individual men and
women for their continuing realization . . .
[There is in the Bible] a complete interfusion of
literary art with theological, moral, or historiosophical vision, the fullest perception of the latter
dependent on the fullest grasp of the former.
(Alter, 1981, pp. x, 12, 19)

Alter’s book is still the best guide in English to
the Hebrew Bible’s narrative strategies.
In a subsequent volume, The Art of Biblical
Poetry (1985), Alter supplies an equally comprehensive guide to the formal systems of biblical
poetry. In the first three chapters of this book he
explores the basic system of semantic parallelism
in biblical poetry, which, unlike phonetic and
syntactic elements, survives translation. Adopting
Barbara Herrnstein Smith’s proposal that Poetry
is distinguished from prose by readers who perceive “that a verbal sequence has a sustained
rhythm, that it is formally structured according
to a continuous operating principle of organiza-

tion,” Alter proceeds to show that what sets
biblical poetry off from surrounding prose is
“the strictly observed principle of parallelism”
(Alter, 1985, p. 6). Biblical poetry relies on
parallelism between two (or sometimes three)
fractions of a line, called versets. Alter’s account
of this technique can easily be summarized by
applying it to the opening lines of five psalms
selected almost at random:
Ps. 46: God is our refuge and strength/
a very present help in trouble.
Ps. 47: O clap your hands, all ye people:/
shout unto God with the voice of
triumph.
Ps. 49: Hear this, all ye people:/
give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
world.
Ps. 50: The mighty God even the Lord hath
spoken./
and called the earth from the rising
of the sun to the going
down thereof.
Ps. 51: Have mercy upon me, O God, according
to thy loving-kindness/
according unto the multitude of
thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions.

There are essentially three kinds of parallelism in
biblical poetry: parallelism of meaning (Pss 46 and
49); parallelism of stresses between the half-lines
(Ps. 47): and syntactic parallelism – “the word
order in each of the half-lines mirroring the
other, with each corresponding term in the same
syntactic position” (p. 7) – which often produces
a chiastic structure (Ps. 51). Alter points out that
modern scholarship has neglected J.G. Herder’s
important observation of the late eighteenth
century that biblical parallelism is rarely used for
synonymity; rather, “the two [parallel] members
strengthen, heighten, empower each other” (p. 11).
The examples from the Psalms illustrate how
these intensifying effects are achieved: by an
impulse to intensification, with an implied “how
much more so” in the second half-line (Ps. 49);
by focusing, in a movement from the general to
the specific (Ps. 46); by linguistic intensification,
in a movement from standard to literary diction
(Ps. 51); by a movement toward narrativity,
from metaphor to story (Ps. 50); and by a

To translate meaning while ignoring the way that
meaning has been articulated is not translation
at all but merely replacement – murdering the
original instead of recreating it. It is partly a
matter of the creative inferiority of the modern
translators; normally they are scholars and
exegetes whose instincts are to replace the dangerous ambiguities of poetry with the safer
specificities of prose. They do not see that the life
of anything written lies in the words and syntax.
While the Renaissance Bible translator saw half
of his task as reshaping English so that it could
adapt itself to Hebraic idiom, the modern translator wants to make no demands on the language
he translates into. (Hammond, 1983, p. 2)

Hammond gives his highest praise to William
Tyndale’s translations, which, despite the adverse
conditions which then prevailed, achieve simplicity, flexibility, and surprising literalness, combined with “a fine capacity to tap the emotional
resources of his original” (p. 43). The New
English Bible, despite its translators’ scholarly
advantages over Tyndale, is the antithesis to the
Authorized Version and “has, in effect, unmade
[an English] Bible which took ninety years to make,
and which held the imaginations and emotions
of its readers for three hundred and fifty years”
(p. 13). One might also add that many lives were
sacrificed, including Tyndale’s, for the Authorized
Version.
In contrast to the negative example of the
New English Bible, several features of Renaissance

translations – especially the Authorized Version
– stand out clearly. The early translators sought
to preserve some of the alien features of the
original instead of statically translating word for
word or idiom for idiom. They celebrated and
incorporated the difference of their primary text.
The Renaissance versions accordingly reshaped
English idiom to adapt it to the Hebrew original,
they preserved poetic ambiguities, rather than
reshaping them into prose, they maintained the
word order of the original and often translated
idioms literally, rather than searching for appropriate idiomatic English equivalents; with relative
consistency they retained the same English word
for the Hebrew, allowing for important comparisons between passages in different parts of
the Bible; they recognized that the most literal
rendering is often the most powerful (as in the
construct form “to eat the bread of sorrows”
noun + “of” + noun); and they relied on the
imaginative and interpretive skills of readers (see
Renaissance studies).
For his translation of the Old Testament,
Tyndale worked from the Masoretic text that
was first printed in 1488. Unlike modern translators who are aware of variants and emendations in the Hebrew, Tyndale saw his source as
an immutable original. Because of this view,
Tyndale was concerned to achieve fullness of
translation, neither taking anything away nor
adding anything to the original as he saw it,
while at the same time conveying some of the
nuances of Hebrew style. One of the most
important of these stylistic features is a lack of
variation in word order, which results from the
ubiquitous use of waw (a coordinating suffix in
biblical Hebrew) that produces predominately
coordinating rather than subordinating clauses.
This practice creates the effect of neutral narrative development (despite omniscient narration)
in which events seem simply to unfold. This
coordinated style is commonly associated with the
unsophisticated and fluent ways children tell
stories, reducing or conflating any separate sense
of cause and consequence into simultaneity.
Fidelity to this feature of biblical Hebrew runs
counter to the highly interpretative and complex
practices in the prose of Erasmus, More, Lyly, and
Sidney. (Although Hammond does not dwell on
this, coordinated prose style reinforces also the
practice of poetic parallelism in the Bible.)

biblical studies

movement toward the extreme, or hyperbole
(Ps. 47). Although he does not dwell on this
point, Alter implies that the reliance of biblical
Hebrew poetry on parallelism greatly contributed to the cultural transmission of the Bible
in translation.
Gerald Hammond’s The Making of the English
Bible (1983) is a detailed examination of the
evolution of the Bible in English during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which culminated in the appearance of the Authorized (or King
James) Version of 1611. By carefully comparing
Renaissance and modern readings with the
Hebrew and Greek texts, Hammond concludes
that the practice and achievement of the earlier
translators is in most ways preferable to the
methods of subsequent modern scholarly translators of the Bible in English:

biblical studies

72
Because Old Testament Hebrew is a highly inflected language, it often uses separate pronouns
for emphasis: “She, even she herself said, He is
my brother.” Such repetition for emphasis is a
distinguishing feature of Tyndale’s translation,
even though he strikes a balance between stylistic
variation and repetition. For example, the Hebrew
text often matches a verb with its most directly
derived noun: “God plagued Pharaoh . . . with
great plagues.” In reproducing these stylistic
details, Tyndale displays his most distinctive
quality, which Hammond describes as “his
matching of simple and direct English to a care
for the essential meaning of the original text”
(p. 38). Tyndale was generally correct in his view
that English is better suited than Latin as a
language for translating Hebrew. Furthermore,
two major syntactic differences between English
and Hebrew are resolved by his translation: in
Hebrew the verb normally precedes the subject
(“. . . and said Moses”) and the adjective often
follows the noun (“cities great and walled up to
heaven”). Later sixteenth-century translators
followed Tyndale in modifying the usual English
syntax to retain the Hebrew word order. This
balance between literalness and flexibility,
Hammond observes, appears also in the fluidity
of Tyndale’s narrative style. The practice of
separating the text into verses began with the
Geneva Bible. As useful as that practice has
become for purposes of reference, Tyndale
appears to have thought beyond separate verses
and thus more fluidly in paragraphs (now a rare
feature in modern Bibles). To illustrate this
point, Hammond offers the telling example of
Tyndale’s translation of Num. 14:22–5, where
God explains why the Children of Israel will not
see the promised land. Whereas the Authorized
Version breaks up the narrative into sentences that
closely correspond to the verse units, Tyndale
turns three and a half verses into a controlled
sentence of more than a hundred words, while
retaining the Hebrew word order:
For all of those men which have seen my glory
and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the
Wilderness, and you have tempted me now this
ten times, and have not harkened unto my
voice, there shall not one see the land which
I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of
them that railed upon me see it: but my servant
Caleb, because there is another manner [of ]

spirit with him, and because he hath followed
me unto the utmost, him will I bring into the
land which he that waled in, and his seed
shall conquer it, and also the Amalachites and
Canaanites which dwell in the low countries.

Such a capacity to render biblical narrative,
Hammond observes, had a major positive
impact on the development of English prose,
even though it soon began to lose ground first to
the Authorized and then to later versions.
Because of Tyndale’s imprisonment and
execution, the English Reformation Bible was
completed by Miles Coverdale, whose ignorance
of Hebrew and Greek forced him to rely on his
aesthetic judgment in choosing among translations.
Tyndale had completed the Pentateuch, Jonah, the
Old Testament historical books, and the New
Testament, leaving most of the poetic books
untranslated. These books, especially the Psalms,
are Coverdale’s great legacy. Coverdale’s grasp
of the essence of Hebrew poetry was intuitive
but remarkably accurate, given his ignorance of
Hebrew scholarship. His translations evolve
toward a rendering of the parallel structure of
Hebrew poetry, including such fine details as
chiastic word order. Coverdale’s 1535 Bible was
the first complete Bible printed in English, and
his 1539 Great Bible became the first authorized
version. In making his 1539 revisions, he had access
to the more scholarly Continental versions,
which enabled him to bring his word order
closer to the Hebrew and to make his word
choices more exact. Despite the appearance of
other English Bibles after the two Coverdale
Bibles, the translations of Tyndale, Coverdale,
and the Geneva Bible became the chief influences
on the Authorized Version.
The major achievement of Hammond’s book
is that it tells the story of the English Bible’s evolution from the inside out, comparing words and
syntax of several versions with the original in order
to show what the Bible is and why the legacy of
Tyndale is so rich. However, in all of his attention to detail, Hammond wisely allows the versions he analyzes to make their own subtle case
against contemporary claims of literalism and
fundamentalism that are so adamantly opposed
to modern biblical scholarship. “For is the
Kingdome of God become words or syllables?” the
Authorized Version’s translators ask rhetorically

73

The day consists of twelve hours: during the
first three hours the Holy One, blessed be He, is
occupying Himself with the Torah; during the
second three He sits in judgment on the whole
world, and when He sees that the World is so
guilty as to deserve destruction, he transfers
Himself from the seat of Justice to the seat of
Mercy; during the third quarter, He is feeding the
whole world, from the horned buffalo to the
brood of vermin; during the fourth quarter
He is sporting with the leviathan. (Abodah
Zarah, p. 36)

Finally, Rabbi Nahman b. Isaac concludes the
discussion by pointing out that God sports with
His creatures and does not laugh at them except
on the day mentioned in the psalm.
This passage in its own way suggests many of
the topics explored in Midrash and Literature,
edited by Geoffrey Hartman and Sanford Budick
(1986). God is a close reader even of his own text

and gives first priority each day to poring over it.
There is humor and joy in His activities, just as
there is in the rabbis’ reading of the psalm. Then,
as they interpret the psalm, the rabbis produce
a kind of discourse that is the very essence of
midrash in that their interpretation of an earlier
text becomes embodied in a narrative within a new
text, thus distinguishing midrash from typology.
As David Stern puts it, “Midrash . . . touches
upon literature not at the point where literature
becomes exegesis but at what might be called its
opposite conjunction, where exegesis turns into
literature and comes to possess its own language
and voice” (Hartman and Budick, 1986, p. 105).
In this volume and in The Genesis of Secrecy
(1979), The Art of Telling (1983), and in his
contributions to The Literary Guide to the Bible
(Alter and Kermode, 1987), Frank Kermode
takes up one of the most perplexing questions concerning the Bible: Can we say anything we like
about a text, or are there institutional controls on
interpretation? This question poses an antithesis
between midrash and peshat, or the plain sense of
things. Taking his cue from Wallace Stevens’s
“The snow man,” Kermode argues that the
antithesis may be insubstantial, that the longing
for the plain sense can never be satisfied, that “the
plain sense depends . . . on imaginative activity
of interpreters” (Hartman and Budick, p. 191).
Finally, it is not the text but the institution of which
he is a part that limits the interpreter’s freedom.
In this respect Christian interpreters have
enjoyed less hermeneutical freedom than Jewish
interpreters, for the Church “in some ways stood
to the New Testament as the New Testament
did to the Old” (p. 187). Even in our own time,
Kermode argues, Protestant hermeneutics has
insisted upon the necessity of understanding tradition as formative of the horizon from which we
must seek some kind of encounter with ancient
texts (188). (In “New Ways with Bible Stories”
(Kermode, 1990, pp. 29–48) Kermode provides
the best brief account available of recent biblical
scholarship inspired by literary criticism and
narrative theory.)
Of the several feminist critics who have set out
to challenge the traditional institutional restraints
on interpretation, which they see as essentially
patriarchal, Mieke Bal’s Lethal Love: Feminist
Literary Readings of Biblical Love Stories (1987) and
Alicia Ostriker’s Feminist Revision and the Bible

biblical studies

in their Preface, as though anticipating twentiethcentury biblical conservatism. Relying on the finest
classical scholarship of their time and inspired
by a loyalty to the Hebrew and Greek texts, while
still retaining a respect for the achievements of
their inspired predecessors, the 1611 translators
achieved perhaps the finest thing ever produced
by a committee. In its retention of parallelism and
coordination, its treatment of the infinitive, its
reproduction of a consecutive narrative syntax,
and its use of the English equivalent of the construct form, the Authorized Version established
an English biblical style that has had a powerful
hold over English prose until modern times.
In an effort to recover the intersection of
biblical narrative art with processes of its
interpretation, several scholars have recently
conducted investigations of the hermeneutical
technique that incorporates interpretation into the
retelling of the story that it sets out to explain. A
rough approximation of the midrashic tradition
can be captured from this delightful passage in
the Talmud in which some rabbis are discussing the fourth verse of Psalm 2: “He that sitteth
in the heavens shall laugh.” Rabbi Isaac’s somber
reflection that God laughs only on that day
described apocalyptically in the psalm prompts
a discussion that includes Rabbi Judah’s account
of how God spends each day:

(1993) are among the most provocative. Ostriker
puts her version of the challenge to traditional
interpretation succinctly: “The biblical story of
monotheism and covenant is, to use the language of politics, a cover-up; . . . when we lift the
cover we find quite another story, an obsessively
told and retold story of erased female power”
(p. 30). A neglected text for the case that female
power is most often erased when the Bible is
read is the stunning example of Proverbs 8, in
which an explicitly female wisdom announces
that she was present with God at the beginning
of creation, that even before the world was she
was there, that those who ignore (or hate) her
wisdom love only death. But here of course, as
Sternberg observed, the Bible provides its own
challenge to later interpretation. Proverbs 8 is
a self-contained, chapter-length monologue,
which awaits any reader who finds his or her way
through the polyvocal texts of the Pentateuch,
the histories, and the prophets to the longpreserved, deeply challenging wisdom literature.
The Bible now seems a collection of texts determined to undermine each of its many affirmations;
its declaration of the prerogatives of the first-born
son inevitably give way to the younger child of
love; its marginalization of women is most often
undercut by their greater intelligence and subtler
power; the high claims of the law and tradition
are subverted long before the first book of the New
Testament is written; but even with the coming
of the new covenant, the authority of Hebrew
scripture in its multiple and always uncertain
interpretations never subsides.

`binary opposition
 A relationship of opposition and mutual exclusion between two elements:
a crucial term in the theories of Structuralism.
Examples of such oppositions would be masculine/
feminine, cold/heat, or up/down.
The phrase appears in the work of the French
structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss
on myths, particularly those of the indigenous
American tribes. He analyzes their legends as
embodying major oppositions between mythical
archetypes of certain animals, such as the Frog and
the Snake. Each animal has certain associations,
and the relations between these associations are
analyzed according to the relations between the
mythic figures which epitomize them. In effect
every mythic creature stands for certain meanings.
From this maneuver is extracted a general rule:
a pair of antagonists is the fundamental element
of all mythic narratives, When one element of
the relation is present, so too, and necessarily, is
the other by means of an operation of difference
predicated upon direct opposition. Binary oppositions occur in all myths and so can be seen to
be the universal factor in the production of
stories. Lévi-Strauss asks why this should be so,
and his answer is that these binary oppositions so
produced are the symptoms in myth of the way
the human mind works, the way in which language
and thought operate.
Many structuralist theorists take this position
as a starting point, especially those concerned
with Narratology. Developing a theory of the
operation of narrative from the work on myths,
narratologists such as A.J. Greimas in his
earlier work take binary oppositions as the basis
for their attempts to theorize the fundamental
structure of all narrative (for an example, see
Actant). Others, for example, Roman Jakobson,
find the concept useful in that it underpins other,
more complex relationships, since it is assumed
to be a structure which is inherent in language

75
haunted by white, its supplement. Meaning is
not simple. This analytical operation is the maneuver which is characteristic of Deconstruction. It is this procedure underpinning Derrida’s
destabilization of the Western metaphysical
tradition, which he notes as depending on
binary oppositions such as writing/speech and
absence/presence.
Avowedly materialist critics have also utilized
the concept of the binary opposition as a useful
point at which to interrogate structuralist practice.
For example, in Literary Theory: An Introduction (1985) the English theorist and critic Terry
Eagleton produces just such a reading. He
begins by noting that for structuralists cultural
forms may change, but the universal oppositions
uncovered by Lévi-Strauss remain. There is a kind
of deeper reality underpinning the ephemeral
changes which take place in the realm of the
social, and this reality is palpably unchanging,
eternal, rooted perhaps in the very biological
structure of the human being. Eagleton criticizes
this universal structure as utterly ahistorical,
leading on to his more general observations about
the structuralist model itself. He problematizes
the separation performed in structuralist theory
between the deeper reality of the structure on
the one hand and the movement of contingency
on the other, and in effect he categorizes the
structuralist method as ideological. To separate a
deeper universal meaning from the play of history and language is to replicate the Arnoldian
maneuver which removes Culture from politics.
However, both deconstructionist and materialist critics acknowledge their own debts to the
theorizing of binary oppositions made by structuralists, as a position from which to begin their
own analyses. The “deconstruction” of these
oppositions produced a decentering of presence
and a reconstruction of the importance of the
written sign. This operation has resulted in the
emergence of Poststructuralism.

itself. Structuralists such as Householder, who
are uncomfortable with an assumption that
binary oppositions are universal, still utilize the
concept because of its methodological rigor. The
one element which all of these different uses of
the concept have in common is its helpfulness
in the operation of classification. Structuralist
literary critics interpret Texts in terms of Codes
which are composed of multiple binary oppositions, classifying the meanings they produce. It
is this reading practice which is assumed to be,
ultimately and universally, the way that meaning
is produced, as the text weaves its way among sets
of binary oppositions. Meaning is oppositional,
but this opposition is stable, with the proviso that
the only legitimate meanings are those which are
constructed in terms of such oppositions.
The importance of binary oppositions as a
crucial part of structuralist practice has led to
a problematizing of the concept by critiques of the
methods of Structuralism as a whole. This is
one of the concerns of the French philosopher
Jacques Derrida in Of Grammatology (1976).
He analyzes binary oppositions by means of a
detailed investigation of the relations between
the two supposedly opposed terms of the Structure. His procedure is to begin from the logic
of Saussure’s structural linguistics, in which
the lexical item (the Sign) has meaning only by
virtue of its difference from other pieces of
vocabulary. Language is structured as a differential System. The meaning of the sign therefore
depends on what it is not, in other words precisely
what it excludes. This insight is then applied to
the structure of binary oppositions themselves,
so that the logic of the mutual exclusion of the
two terms is seen to be dependent on the differential structure. Derrida questions the rigor of this
structure by suggesting that in fact each term of
an opposition depends for its exclusivity upon the
success of the operation which places the two terms
in contradiction. He destabilizes this operation
of simple binarism by showing that such terms
can be analyzed as each containing elements of
the other. For example, using this technique, it
could be argued that the opposition between
black and white is not so simple as structuralists
would propose. Black is black by virtue of its
not being white, in a relation of difference. But
since it is precisely this difference which defines
black, rather than its own blackness, it is forever

76
`biology, philosophy of 
The branch of philosophy that is devoted to the study of biology.
As a subset of Philosophy of science, philosophy of biology restricts its focus mainly to
biology, although other sciences such as physics
and chemistry are also important.
Essentially, biology is the study of life, and it
is often to biology that we turn when we have
questions not just about life in general, but
about human nature. Although biology is mainly
comprised of facts, “biology’s exciting conclusions
do not follow from the facts alone” (Sterelny and
Griffiths, 1999, p. 5). Claims in biology often
leave the realm of data analysis and enter the realm
of self-reflection and speculation, and for this
reason, one might argue, philosophy has a clear
place in biology.
For simplicity’s sake, one might say there are
three general types of questions in philosophy
of biology. The first contains questions in philosophy of science that have been narrowed to
the subject of biology. For example, general epistemological questions about explanation in science
or the status of laws in science are narrowed to
questions about explanation in biology and the
status of laws in biology. The second type of
question contains problems in biology that biology has been unable to answer. An example here
would be any question in theoretical biology,
such as whether organisms have become more
complex over time. A third type of question
takes traditionally philosophical questions and
applies biology to them in an attempt to make
some philosophical progress. For example, one
might look towards biology to understand the
development of morality based on our social
instincts.
With respect to philosophy, the first set of
questions can be construed as mainly philosophy
of science and the third set as purely philosophical. However, the second set of questions is solely
philosophy of biology. Most of the questions I pose
in this article are of this second kind.
Biology is a vast area of research that includes
many disciplines and subfields that are constantly
expanding and diverging. Philosophy of biology
recognizes this and attempts to deal with all of
biology, from genetics to paleontology to
biotechnology. The biological and philosophical
questions raised among each discipline are of
course quite diverse, but a few of the most rele-

vant and philosophically interesting can serve as
an introduction to this diverse field.
Genetics Genetics studies inheritance, or rather
the heredity unit, the gene. Although one might
argue that philosophy of biology started with
the publication of David Hull’s Philosophy of
Biological Science (1974), it wasn’t until Richard
Dawkins’s book The Selfish Gene was published
in 1976 that questions in philosophy of biology
became prominent. Dawkins’s basic argument
is that in evolutionary theory one should not
focus on natural selection acting on organisms (as
Darwin did in The Origin of Species), but rather
one should concentrate on genes. To appreciate
Dawkins’s point, we must first understand
Darwin’s perspective on natural selection at the
organismic level.
Darwin gave three conditions for evolution by
natural selection: variation, heredity, and differential reproduction. The first is self-explanatory,
the second concerns some kind of replication or
way for information to pass from one generation
to the next, and the third says that entities reproduce at different rates. For Darwin, organisms met
these three conditions; for example, ants vary, they
have a hereditary mechanism (although Darwin
did not know what it was), and some ants will
reproduce better than other ants. For Dawkins
however, it is the gene that best fits these conditions; genes vary, they are a hereditary mechanism,
and some genes do better getting into the next generation than others. The Selfish Gene argues that
genes are the replicators “striving” to get into
the next generation, and they “use” organisms
merely as their vehicles. So it is the “selfish”
genes that are running the show, and we are
merely their disposable transport. This of course
raises many questions, the most basic being,
what is a gene (e.g. Beurton et al., 2000) and do
genes actually carry information? Although
somewhat simplistic, these are questions that
still plague philosophers and biologists today,
and surprisingly there is much disagreement
among the literature.
Some more questions created by Dawkins
include: How much are we “hardwired” by our
genes, and do we have “genes for” certain behavioral characteristics? Is the genetic level somehow
unique and more important than other levels, such
as the organismic or molecular level? And is the

77

Molecular Biology Molecular biology studies
the interactions between molecules. Questions in
philosophy of biology that concern molecular
biology are often very similar to those concerning genetics. For instance, with respect to the
genetic level, a good question is whether or not
most biological explanation can occur at this level.
With respect to molecular biology, one can ask
if it is not really the genes but the molecules that
give complete explanation. As an example, take
the Mendelian concept of a gene: it is a functional
unit used in population biology, evolutionary
theory, etc., that allows biologists to track heredity among populations. For molecular biology,
however, a gene is a string of nucleic acids that
codes for proteins. For someone who wants to
reduce biological explanation to the molecular
level, there is the question of how we reconcile
the Mendelian gene with the molecular gene – is
it even possible? Alex Rosenberg (2006) argues that
reducing all biology, such as Mendel’s theory,
to molecular biology is ideal, and that the only
reason we really have genetics and especially
higher-level biology, such as population biology,
macroevolution, etc., is because of our epistemic
limitations. If we could understand everything
at the molecular level, Rosenberg argues that we
could understand and predict all biological and
scientific phenomena. Philosophical questions

that arise from molecular biology quite often
hinge on whether or not biology is reducible.
Evolutionary Biology Evolutionary biology is a
broad discipline concerned with questions about
the origin and descent of species and their
modification over time, i.e. their evolution.
Neo-Darwinism refers, in its broad usage, to the
current biological paradigm where evolutionary
theory permeates all biological research. Evolutionary biology as an academic discipline began
as a result of the modern synthesis around the
1930s and 1940s. It is one of the largest areas to
attract philosophers of biology because it contains
much theoretical biology found in subfields such
as paleobiology, macroevolution, phylogenetics,
etc. I will describe a few of the more interesting
questions for philosophers of biology that arise
in evolutionary biology.
1. What is a species? Just like asking what is
a gene, asking what is a species seems like a very
simple question, but the literature is full of disagreement. First of all one could be an essentialist and argue that a species has an essence that
defines it. This idea can be traced back to platonic
forms and Plato’s idea that nature is “carved at
its joints” (Phaedrus 265d–266a). However,
because evolution is based on change, one might
argue that species are never static enough to have
true and stable essences. It is also a problem
because defining when speciation has created a new
species as opposed to slightly changing an already
defined species is a problem. A second answer is
that a “species is a series of ancestor descendent
populations passing through time and space
independent of other populations, each of which
possesses its own evolutionary tendencies and
historical fate” (George Gaylord Simpson, 1951).
This is known as the evolutionary species concept,
not to be confused with another answer to the
question, the biological species concept, where
species are defined as interbreeding concepts.
This last idea is probably the most widely
accepted, although it is still a question among the
philosophy of biology literature whether or not
a species has unchanging essential characteristics.
2. How deterministic is evolution? The topic
of how much chance or determinism there is in
evolution can be approached from a micro- or
macro-evolutionary level. With respect to the
latter, Steven J. Gould famously asked (1989): if

biology, philosophy of

best explanation for biological phenomena
found at the genetic level?
Dawkins’s ideas were and are very controversial. One reason is because “the selfish gene” can
also be read as “the altruistic human,” since a
human who acts altruistically is only that way
because of his or her selfish genes. As Dawkins
argues, often the best way for genes to get to the
next generation is if they help other copies of their
genes found in relatives. This is known as kin
selection. Another way to explain the altruistic
“vehicle” is that an altruistic organism is more
likely to find a mate, be helped out of dangerous
situations, etc., which gives a gene a better possibility of surviving to the next generation. Many
criticisms of Dawkins focus on his parsimony
and level monism, because he only focuses on the
genetic level; biology is a complex discipline that
many argue cannot be reduced and simplified to
one level of explanation like the story in The
Selfish Gene.

we reran the “tape of life” starting from the
Cambrian Explosion, would we get the same outcome? The Cambrian Explosion occurred around
570–530 million years ago and marks an “explosion” of diversity among living things, with the
appearance of the lineages of almost all living
animals today. Interestingly enough, most of that
diversity went extinct. Gould is asking: if we reran
the tape of life and allowed the Cambrian Explosion to take place again, would the same organisms
survive? Would humans still exist, would mammals, would vertebrates? This question ultimately
hinges on how much determinism or chance there
is in evolution. After the Cambrian Explosion,
Gould argues that the organisms that survived did
so mainly by chance and that if we reran the tape
of life the “coin flip” might go in the other direction and humans would not have evolved. This
means that human existence is accidental, a
rather disconcerting and controversial idea.
With respect to micro-evolution, one might ask
whether more change in a population occurs from
genetic drift or natural selection. For example, when
we look at butterfly spots that have changed
from one generation to the next, this could be
an adaptation, or simply the result of a random
genetic mutation. Although there may be ways
to try to test whether these butterfly spots are
an adaptation, in general there is no empirical
way as of yet to test how much change in a
population is due to natural selection as opposed
to drift. Hence there is no way to tell how much
chance there is at the micro-evolutionary level.
So there is still a theoretical debate as to the role
of natural selection and chance (drift) in evolutionary change.
3. How important is adaptation? Along the
same lines as arguing about the importance of
natural selection, we can argue about the importance of adaptation. Traits are adaptive if they
are selected for and increase the fitness of an
organism in a certain environment; for example,
plants may develop toxicity because they are in
an environment where their leaves are being
eaten by insects. As already discussed, besides
adaptation, some traits might come about by
random mutation, and other traits might come
about as “by-products” or “spandrels.” During one
of the most heated debates in philosophy of biology, Steven J. Gould and Richard C. Lewontin
(1979) argued against panadaptationism and

the “Panglossian Paradigm.” Panadaptationism,
or simply adaptationism, is the idea that every
trait contributes to the fitness of an organism and
hence is adaptive. The Panglossian Paradigm
refers to Voltaire’s Dr Pangloss, who said that
everything happened for a reason, such as the
bridge of our nose for holding spectacles, because
we live in the best of all possible worlds. Gould
and Lewontin claim that panadaptationists argue
the same thing. For example, they argue that
traits such as our ear lobes are adapted for
holding earrings (or more realistically for sexual
selection), when really ear lobes were not selected
for at all, they are just by-products, or “spandrels,”
from the way our ears form. Another example
would be the human chin. It is most likely that
the chin was not necessarily selected for, but just
a by-product of the constraints produced by
human facial structure; thus the chin itself is a
somewhat arbitrary trait. The problem, as Gould
and Lewontin see it, is that evolutionary biologists often tend to try to explain all traits in all
organisms as somehow adaptive, and end up
telling “just-so stories” with no real scientific
basis (Gould and Lewontin, 1979).
4. Is there progress in evolution? Another
important topic in evolutionary biology pertains
to evolutionary progress. If we compare bacteria
to humans, for instance, can we say there has been
some progress? This is a tricky question because
in evolutionary terms an organism is successful
if it survives and reproduces, and cyanobacteria
have been around for about 3.5 billion years;
humans on the other hand have only been
around for about 200,000 years. However, one
might argue that our intelligence seems to show
that humans have progressed beyond cyanobacteria. But again, this is tricky, because progress is
a subjective and value-laden term, and biology
is based on facts. One would not want to fall
prey to Hume’s is-ought problem. It seems that
whenever progress is discussed in evolution it
ultimately leads to the conclusion that humans are
the pinnacle of progress and whatever characteristics we have are the best and most progressive.
To avoid this anthropocentrism, instead of progress one can discuss trends in evolution. There
are trends in body size, tool-use, number of
parts, and so on. This probably isn’t satisfying for
someone trying to prove the remarkableness of
humans, but it is better science.

79
because a learned fear would often mean a snake
bite and then death before reproduction, so
those humans with a fear “module,” as Öhman
and Mineka say, would have higher fitness.
However, you could imagine a case where someone with a snake fear module grew up in a
household of snakes, thus overcoming this fear.
Or imagine someone without the snake fear
having a traumatic experience with a snake, thus
causing a learned fear. This is just one of the ways
to approach the question of whether or not cultural behaviors are learned or hardwired.
3. What is culture and how does it evolve?
It is hard to find a general definition of culture,
because culture in many ways seems best defined
by examples. Yet for anthropologists, physiologists,
etc., it is important to have a general, practical,
and working definition. I give three possible
ways to approach understanding culture.
First of all, a philosopher of biology most likely
wants to define culture in terms of Darwinian
natural selection. However, this broaches questions
like number 2 above about whether or not our
behavior is hardwired by genes. This was the
view of E.O. Wilson in Sociobiology: The New
Synthesis and was one of the most despised theories among philosophers and biologists alike.
Wilson argued that much of our culture and
social behavior is evolutionarily based, meaning in
our genes. Much of his book was uncontroversial, but near the end he suggested that human
behaviors such as racism, rape, and homosexuality might be hardwired; he even suggested that
some humans might have a predisposition to
certain social classes. The problem was, and is, that
humans aren’t as easy to study as ants, Wilson’s
other specialty. Humans have a longer generational
time, they have much more variety in environments, their actions are more plastic because of
consciousness and rational decision, and therefore
generalizations about human action are not easily justified. By making general statements about
human behavior one can fall prey to genetic
determinism – again, not an appealing conclusion.
However, this does not mean that evolution is not
helpful when looking at human culture: sociobiology has just taught us to be careful with our
speculations, because human behaviors are not as
easily understood as ant behaviors.
A second way to define culture is through
Dawkins’s use of “memes.” Dawkins introduced

biology, philosophy of

Human Biology Probably the most far reaching
of the different areas, human biology discusses
human nature by touching upon Cultural
anthropology, cultural evolution, biological
anthropology, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and many other disciplines. I will discuss
three of the questions most interesting in human
biology for a philosopher of biology.
1. Is there an essential human nature? One
way to approach this question is to look at the
genetic code and the similarities in the genetic code
among all humans. However, our DNA is 96–98
percent similar to chimpanzee DNA, so general
similarity may not be the answer. If we knew more
about specific genes then perhaps certain genes
unique to humans could be part of an essential
human nature (e.g. a gene for language), but science is far from understanding genes and their
functions. Besides this empirical way to test for
an essential human nature, there is the theoretical question of whether or not it can even exist.
If Homo sapiens is a species like any other that
changes and evolves over time, then a stable
essence seems impossible. Yet there is still something intriguing about finding out what makes
humans human. Another possibility is to look at
what is unique to humans, such as language,
abstract thought, symbolic behavior, and so on;
however, recent experiments done with chimpanzees seem to show that all these behaviors
are a difference in degree and not kind. Chimps
can perform primitive sign language, they show
some symbolic behavior, etc. So either we
redefine the “traits” that are uniquely human, or
we recognize that humans possess a great similarity with other animals.
2. Are some of our cultural behaviors “hardwired”? In many ways one could interpret this as
a modern day nature versus nurture debate.
However, this distinction is problematic because
it presupposes mutual exclusivity. It is more useful to ask if our behaviors are hardwired, and if
so, how rigidly. Even if a behavior is hardwired,
this only means that one has a propensity to
follow it, and without the right circumstances a
hardwired behavior may not come to fruition. For
instance, it has been shown that many humans
are hardwired to be afraid of snakes (Öhman
and Mineka, 2001) because snakes were potentially
deadly threats to our ancestors. For our ancestors,
a hardwired fear of snakes was important

the idea of memes at the end of The Selfish Gene
and compared a meme in culture to a gene in
an organism. Just like genes, memes replicate
and carry information. A meme can be a catchy
tune, a way of dressing, a certain phrase, a moral
norm, a dance step, an action such as smoking,
and so on. As Dawkins says, it is “a unit of
cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation”
(1976). However, memes are not controlled by
genes but are just their own products that have
their own “agenda” to reproduce. According to
memetics a type of Darwinian selection does
control culture, but it is independent from
natural selection at the genetic level.
A third way to define culture is to take this
theory of memetics and deepen it by introducing
a relationship between genes and memes. This
theory is called gene/culture dual evolutionary
theory or dual inheritance theory. In this theory
genes and cultural variants (what gene/culture
dual evolutionists call memes) evolve simultaneously. For example, the gene for lactose tolerance
was recently found to have coevolved with the
spread of dairy farming, which started around
9,000 years ago in Europe (see Laland and
Brown, 2002). When humans started dairy
farming, this cultural trait created a selection
pressure for an allele for lactose tolerance. This
allele arose as a random mutation, but because
of the cultural environment, became a fitnessenhancing trait. So the gene/culture dual evolutionary theorists disagree with the memeticists by
arguing that culture is not completely independent from our genes and our biology. However,
unlike the sociobiologists, they give examples
like diary farming where the culture comes first,
and then the genetics coevolve.
Although none of these approaches give a
definite definition to culture, they do show how
the term is used in contemporary research.
Conclusion The philosopher of biology Robert
Brandon said that in the late 1970s he knew of
only five other philosophers of biology (1996,
pp. xii–xiii). Since that time the field has grown
considerably. It is an exciting branch of philosophy with a rich and diverse set of issues whose
reflections change as biological theories change.
Not only does philosophy of biology theorize
about the latest biological findings, it also exam-

ines problems that have plagued philosophy for
centuries and renders them in a new light, with
new possibilities of understanding and discovery.

`black aesthetic
The aesthetic program propagated by practitioners of the Black arts
movement during the 1960s. Committed to a
radical revaluation of Western aesthetic ideology, black aesthetic theorists claimed to derive
their conception of black art from traditional
African aesthetics. Against the Western notion of
great art as a category that transcends Ideology,
the black aesthetic stridently declared its political intention of furthering the aims of black
nationalism. Refusing the ideology of art for art’s
sake and fusing aesthetics with Ethics, black
aesthetic critics regarded artistic form as a transparent medium of moral and political messages,
and could justify Art only if it served the function of raising the cultural consciousness of the
black community. Elements of African culture

`black arts movement 
A separatist black
cultural movement developed during the middle
and late 1960s by a variety of dramatists, poets,
and critics in largely urban areas of the United
States. Among its prominent practitioners and
advocates were: Amiri Baraka, Ed Bullins, Mari
Evans, Hoyt W. Fuller, Addison Gayle, Jr, Nikki
Giovanni, Stephen Henderson, Ron Karenga,
Haki Madhubuti, Ron Milner, Larry Neal,
Carolyn Rodgers, and Sonia Sanchez. Explicitly
committed to propagating the ideology of black
cultural nationalism, the black arts movement
was founded on the premise that black people in
the United States share a unique set of aesthetic
and cultural values which require indigenous
modes of appreciation that must be developed
completely separately from the surrounding
white culture.
In order to raise black consciousness and to
free the black community from the false consciousness produced by participation in mainstream American culture, black arts proponents
attempted to create an autonomous black cultural
community by various means. Several independent journals (Journal of Black Poetry, Black Books
Bulletin), publishing houses (Broadside Press,
Jihad Press, Third World Press), theater groups
(Baraka’s Harlem Black Arts Repertory Theater
School, Barbara Ann Teer’s National Black
Theater), and other cultural organizations (such
as Spirit House in Newark, or the Black
Academy of Arts and Letters) were founded in
the 1960s. Numerous cultural events including
street plays and poetry readings, concerts, lectures,
exhibitions, and creative writing workshops were
organized during this period with the explicit
goal of fashioning an alternative system of values
for the black community. Although the Black aesthetic program developed by black arts advocates
has been severely criticized by subsequent generations of black writers, the black arts movement
enabled remarkable formal innovations in all
genres of black literature, and undeniably succeeded in promoting a powerful sense of black
cultural pride and solidarity.

black arts movement

dance, and religious practices) were appropriated
and celebrated by numerous black artists during
the 1960s in an attempt to recover an alternative
cultural tradition that survived the middle passage
and the ensuing history of slavery and political
oppression. Affirming the cultural resources of
the black community, black aesthetic theorists
soundly condemned the Western aesthetic privileging of the individual artist as the source of
creation. The collective emphasis of black aesthetic
ideology motivated its promotion of certain literary genres over others as well as its perception
of oral forms as the repositories of authentic
black communal consciousness. Often elevating
music in particular to a black cultural paradigm,
black aesthetic critics preferred Poetry and
drama as the genres which, because they are
more amenable to public oral performances
than fiction, are capable of achieving a direct, interactive relationship between the artist and the
black community.
Perhaps the most profoundly transformative
element of black aesthetic ideology was its redefinition of the category of blackness as a beautiful,
natural, vital essence. However, this new mystique
of blackness was often elaborated in highly dogmatic terms, discouraging literary explorations
of the internal differences that complicate any
unitary conception of black experience. Consequently, black writers and critics of the 1970s and
1980s have reacted sharply against black aesthetic theory on several grounds, including its
essentialist and sternly prescriptive discourse on
racial authenticity (see Gates, 1978), and its
projection of black machismo, conjoined with
its dismissal of black feminist ideology as a form
of false Western consciousness that impedes the
formation of a unified black community (see
McDowell, 1989; Smith, 1989).

`black cultural studies
The notion of a black
cultural studies is both problematic and locatable
in a specific set of critical and cultural practices.
While there is no definition of the term “black
cultural studies,” a wide range of Writings,
theories, cultural work, and performances have
emerged as an informally defined area of inquiry
within what has come to be called Cultural
studies. Such Discourses have been related to
the histories and Cultures of peoples historically invoked and produced as “black” or, at
other times, more loosely as “Third World,” in
a postindependence, postcolonial and post-Civil
Rights framework. A black cultural studies
addresses the interests, concerns, ideologies, and
contexts of black cultural work within a national
and global context. While no particular set of
theories proposes a separate area called black
cultural studies, the analysis and critique of work
dealing with questions of Race and Ideology,
race and Culture, race and material practice, race
and Gender, emerged out of and within the
absences and legacies of existing critical and cultural studies. Where race was merely incidental
to the axis around which different trajectories of
cultural studies emerged, a black cultural studies
accounts for the ways race plays a crucial part
within feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, and
postcolonial theories of culture.
There are different contingent developments
within the broader area of cultural studies which
have contributed to the emergence of race as a crucial component of a politically informed practice
of culture. In Britain, the development of British
cultural studies, in its many different inflections
till the 1970s and the early 1980s, largely tended to
overlook or include (in a peripheral fashion) the
intersections of race, sexuality, and gender toward
a primarily class and political economy-based
critique of culture. While research and cultural
work continually addressed concerns of race and
gender within British cultural studies, it was the
broad expanse of writings in informal spaces, as

well as through centers like the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of
Birmingham, journals such as Race and Class,
and the dialogs within community centers, art
communities, cultural workers, film and theater
practitioners, and independent collectives such as
the Sankofa, Ceddo, Retake, and Black Audio
Film Collectives which brought about a more
rigorous and popular shift in the cultural work
being done from the 1970s to the 1990s.
In the United States, the popularization and
diffusion of the term “cultural studies” has produced numerous versions of a United Statesbased form of cultural studies, with various
genealogies or intellectual formations. The particular history of cultural work in the United
States has produced a critical practice committed
to exploring the cultural production of various
legally constituted minorities as part of the
broader development of cultural studies with
the legacies of a postemancipation and postCivil Rights discourse. Of these recent critical
developments, which I am locating primarily
within the Academy and other institutions of
culture, the impact and pertinence of race in
the study of Popular culture has been an
important though marginal aspect of the
development of an American cultural studies.
The very term “black cultural studies” must
be viewed as part of a larger movement toward
both a moving away from traditional theoretical
approaches to black culture, as well as an inflection within the US context of a rigorous minority discourse during the 1980s and the 1990s.
While the expression could be regarded as a contradiction in terms from some viewpoints, it is
also part of the historic formations of political and
cultural frameworks within the United States.
As such, the articulation of a black cultural
studies has been in tandem with the emergence
of an Asian–American cultural studies, a Latino/
Chicana/o cultural studies, and so on, not as
independent developments, but rather, as deeply
imbricated by the political and legal rhetorics
within the United States.

`black nationalism
 Black nationalist movements of various kinds have had a long and
continuous history in the United States, from
the back-to-Africa emigrationist societies of the
late eighteenth century to the hip-hop nationalism of the 1990s. Despite sharp ideological
differences, all types of black nationalism share
the conviction that blacks exist in a relationship
of colonial subordination to white America, and
can attain economic, political, and cultural equality only through the development of a racial
solidarity based on their common experience of
oppression. Strategic separatism from mainstream
American society is essential to all kinds of black
nationalism, whether the ultimate goal be the
establishment of a separate black nation or the
achievement of full citizenship in the United
States. For the sake of analytical clarity, the many
black nationalist ideologies may be divided into
the following categories.
Territorial separatism is perhaps the most extreme variety of black nationalism, represented by
organizations such as the Republic of New Africa
and the Revolutionary Action Movement, which
demand the formation of geographically demarcated and sovereign all-black townships or states
within the United States.
Closely affiliated to territorial separatism is
emigrationism, which enjoyed its heyday during
the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth
centuries, and whose most celebrated proponents
include Martin Delany, Alexander Crummell,
and Marcus Garvey. It called for the founding
of a separate nation in Africa, Haiti, or even
Canada, consisting of black émigrés from the
United States.
Several black nationalist ideologies have been
inspired and authorized by radical theologies
of political emancipation. Whether Christian,
Jewish, or Muslim, religious nationalist thinkers
and organizations such as Albert Cleage, the
National Committee of Black Churchmen, the

black nationalism

Carby, Erroll Lawrence, Pratibha Parmar, Paul
Gilroy, Homi Bhabha, Jim Pines, Kobena Mercer,
and the films of the various film and video
collectives such as Ceddo, Black Audio, Sankofa,
Star, and Retake, and the various informal
modes of exchange through the works of various
black playwrights/performers such as Benjamin
Zephaniah, Mustapha Matura, Yvonne Brewster,
Hanif Khureishi, and black/Asian artists in
Britain, created a milieu of cultural work that was
locally based, committed, and theoretically
engaged with questions of Aesthetics, practice,
audience, and Ideology.
In the United States since the 1980s, a number
of publications have emerged that map, discuss,
and debate the various implications of cultural
studies in that country and its differing genealogies. Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture,
Cultural Studies by Grossberg, Nelson, Treichler,
various journals such as Inscriptions, Cultural
Studies, Transitions, Diaspora, Cultural Critique,
Critical Inquiry, Black Popular Culture, and the
writings of people like Michele Wallace, bell
hooks, Wahneema Lubiano, Cornel West,
Manthia Diawara, Herman Grey, Clyde Taylor,
Michael Dyson, Tricia Rose, Houston Baker, and
Henry Louis Gates among others, have discussed
the practice of a black cultural studies which
maintains “race” as a critical axis of inquiry.

Nation of Islam, and the Moorish American
Science Temple maintain that blacks are a chosen people whose liberation is divinely ordained,
but who must nevertheless form separatist religious organizations to work actively toward
freedom.
Perhaps the most popular of all the nationalist ideologies is cultural nationalism, based on
the belief that black people across the globe share
a unique culture originating in Africa. The 1960s
in America witnessed the spawning of numerous
cultural nationalist organizations, among them
Amiri Baraka’s Congress of African Peoples
and Ron Karenga’s US Organization, all of
which were committed to preserving and celebrating black cultural difference by recovering
an unbroken cultural heritage rooting back to
Africa. The cultural nationalists regard institutional separatism as a necessary precondition for
developing alternative, indigenous interpretative systems that alone can fully comprehend
and appreciate the non-Western modes of black
American Culture.
During the 1960s, cultural nationalism was
often sharply polarized against revolutionary
nationalism, which was advocated by organizations such as the Black Panther Party, the Dodge
Revolutionary Union Movement, and the League
of Revolutionary Black Workers. The most significant point of disagreement between these two
ideologies is that, while the cultural nationalists
consider the cultural independence of the black
community to be a prerequisite to its political
liberation, the revolutionary nationalists, depending on homegrown variants of Marxist–Leninist
Ideology, contend that black liberation requires
the overthrow of American capitalism.
Economic autonomy has always formed a
crucial component of black nationalist ideology,
ranging from the socialist ideal of the revolutionary
nationalists to the bourgeois nationalism of organizations like the United Negro Improvement
Association and the Nation of Islam. The most
widespread form of black economic nationalism
in the United States has been bourgeois in its
orientation, encouraging black-hiring and buyblack campaigns in the hope of establishing an
independent black capitalist economy parallel
to the American capitalist system.
Of course, in actuality none of these nationalist
ideologies has operated in a pure state unmixed

with the others. A rare kind of nationalism that
lacks a historic relationship to a specific geographical territory, black nationalism in the
United States has nevertheless derived its effective
power and its ideological coherence from a profound sense of disaffection with the processes of
American capitalism and democracy.

`Bloch, Ernst (1885–1977)
German Marxist
philosopher.
Born in Ludwigshafen, the son of a railway
worker, Bloch was educated in Munich,
Würzburg, and Berlin (where he met Lukács)
before moving to Heidelberg. In his first expressionistic book, Geist der Utopia (1918) Bloch
sought to revitalize utopian thought, seemingly
combining Marxist materialism with mystic and
messianic elements. Thomas Münzer als Theologe
der Revolution (1921) developed Bloch’s concern
with the revolutionary potential of religious
thought, and indeed his perception of the inherently religious nature of humanity. In Erbschaft
dieser Ziet (Heritage of Our Times) (1935) Bloch
responded to the rise of Nazism with a series
of cultural and social analyses that embraced
physics alongside music, cinema, literature, and
politics. In 1938 Bloch was forced into exile in
America. Although he had no academic post, it
was there that he wrote his most important work,
Das Prinzip Hoffnung (The Principle of Hope).
This may be taken to underline the shift in
emphasis of Bloch’s concerns from the religious
and messianic to a more broadly based social
and cultural analysis of utopian aspiration and
longing. In 1949 Bloch returned to Europe, to

`Bloom, Harold (1930–) 
American literary
theorist and critic. One of the most influential and
widely read living theorists of Poetry, Bloom
is an extraordinarily prolific, individualistic,
and controversial writer and editor. Like many
other North American theorists who came
into prominence during the second half of the
twentieth century, Bloom did his early work on
English Romanticism (see Romantic studies).
His writing falls roughly into four groups: (i) a
series of studies in Romantic poetry: Shelley’s
Mythmaking (1959), The Visionary Company
(1961), Blake’s Apocalypse (1963), and the commentary and annotations for The Poetry and
Prose of William Blake, edited by David Erdman
(1965); (ii) six books on the theory of poetry:
The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry
(1973), A Map of Misreading (1975b), Kabbalah
and Criticism (1975a), Poetry and Repression
(1976), Agon: Towards a Theory of Revisionism
(1982), and The Breaking of the Vessels (1982);
(iii) studies in the modernist inheritance of
Romanticism and its transformation into “the
American Sublime”: Yeats’ “A Vision” (1972),
Figures of Capable Imagination (1976), and Wallace
Stevens: The Poems of Our Climate (1977); and
(iv) the Chelsea House series of literally several
hundred volumes of criticism on major writers
and texts, each volume selected, edited, and
introduced by Bloom. This final project may
be the most ambi-tious ever undertaken by a
single literary critic. Although often considered
a member of what was once the “Yale school” of
criticism – which included Geoffrey Hartman,
J. Hillis Miller, and Paul De man – Bloom has
often respectfully distanced himself from their
work. He once announced his determination
to find a middle way between the spiritualism
of Auerbach and Frye and the deconstructive
secularism of Derrida and Miller.
In the clarity and consistency of its vision,
however, Bloom’s theory of literature most closely

Bloom, Harold

but severe criticism by more orthodox or vulgar
Marxists. By chance he was in West Germany
in 1961 when the Berlin Wall was raised, and he
applied for political asylum. He accepted a post
at Tübingen. His extensive late publications
include works on religion, metaphysics, materialism, and natural law.
Bloch’s Marxism rests within the tradition of
process philosophy. The ontological structures
of the human being and the world are “not
yet” given or achieved. Bloch stresses the future
orientation of Marxism, arguing that Marx transformed philosophy by making the recognition
of present contradiction the ground for future
orientated practice. Previously, philosophy had
merely interpreted the past. Marxism is thereby
presented, paradoxically, as an open System.
Hegel’s backward-looking system, characterized
by anamnesis, is closed. It presupposes that truth
has already been realized. Bloch’s philosophy is
in contrast open not merely to new particularistic content, but also to the possibility that such
content will demand the rethinking of the system’s
categories. Yet the philosophy remains disciplined. It lacks the coherence of a closed system,
because the world itself is not well ordered.
Bloch frequently appeals to the fragments and
montage techniques of expressionism in order to
explore the tension and latency within contemporary society.
In diverse aspects of Culture, and specifically in imaginative yearning, be it for a better
society or merely for such technological achievement as flight, Bloch finds evidence of humanity
being “not yet conscious” of its truth and potential. The operator “not yet” (noch nicht) allows
Bloch to transform concepts, and so highlight
the complex future orientation concealed within
overtly repressive social relationships. The “not
yet” refers at once to that which is conceivable,
but not yet possible; present now, but only
problematically; that which is expected in the
future and that which has “still not” occurred.
The utopian future is obscurely glimpsed in
its preappearance (Vor-Schein), through humanity’s discontent with this world, and its hope for
a better world. For Bloch such yearning is not
empty but, through disciplined interpretation,
serves as the point of departure for revolutionary practice.

resembles that of Frye. Not only do Bloom and
Frye share a deep imaginative commitment to the
work of William Blake, but also, like Blake, they
see Literary criticism, theory, and history at
their best as poetic projects. As though in response
to Blake’s aphorism, “without contraries is no
progression,” Bloom’s books read as if it were
a progressive contrary to Frye’s. Whereas Frye is
at his best when writing about Comedy and
romance, Bloom is at his best in the modes of
Tragedy and Irony. For him the history of
poetry is a Nietzschean struggle (or agon)
of powerful wills, but – in the manner of Blake’s
resolution of the Oedipal struggle between the
repressive father Urizen and revolutionary son
Orc – the triumph of the belated son eventually
lies in his final embrace and incorporation of
his progenitor. Creative belatedness for Bloom
requires the embracing and revisionary appropriation of the past. Though the later strong poet
revises his precursor in a willful Misreading,
responding to the Anxiety of influence that
comes to him from the work of earlier strong
poets, the prolific outcome is a continuation of
the poetic line of descent.
Also like Blake and Frye, Bloom’s progeny
have been anything but passive receivers of the
will of the father. His most notorious follower
is Camille Paglia, herself a prodigious scholar
and outrageous bane of American feminists.
However, as Bloom’s best commentator Peter
de Bolla has observed, the determined efforts
of Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar to write
a comprehensive literary history of women is
also a Bloomian legacy (de Bolla, 1988, p. 12).
Despite Bloom’s outrageous and deliberately
provocative anti-feminism, he has written a
detailed and brilliant commentary on Hebrew
Scripture (The Book of J), suggesting that the
Yahwist poet (J) was (or should have been) a
woman (see Biblical studies).

`Boas, Franz (1858–1942) 
North American
anthropologist. Often regarded as the founder of
modern anthropology in North America, Boas
was also a major contributor to early twentiethcentury studies of Native American Cultures.
Born in Westphalia, Germany, he studied geography, physics, and mathematics, receiving his
doctorate at Kiel in 1881. The following year,
he accompanied a meteorological expedition to
Greenland, where “a year spent as an Eskimo
among Eskimos . . . led me . . . towards a desire
to understand what determines the behavior of
human beings.” Emigrating to the United States,
Boas taught geography and anthropology at Clark
University and then at Columbia University
until 1937, where he remained Professor Emeritus
until his death. His students included Alfred
Kroeber, Margaret Mead, and others who
became major figures in twentieth-century
American anthropology and Cultural studies.
In place of grand theories or laws, Boas
insisted instead upon the careful recording of
even apparently small details of cultural expression as the only solid empirical basis for understanding and appreciating human behavior in
all its diversity and richness – an approach
which became known as historical particularism.
Criticizing biological determinism (“nature”), he
emphasized the primacy of culture (“nurture”)
in human development, engaging what became
one of the crucial intellectual and ideological
debates of the century. He also stressed the complexity, essential adequacy, and uniqueness of
all human cultures and languages. Boas helped
establish the methodological importance of
direct, personal fieldwork, and he conducted
extensive linguistic fieldwork among Native
Americans on the Canadian Pacific coast. He
was wary of popularizing scholarship because he
feared its oversimplified use in political causes, and
he condemned fascist pseudoscientific theories of
racial superiority in the 1930s.

economic value. The poor were defined as
lacking the racialized characteristics of “fair skin,
straight hair, orgnathous jaw, skull shape and
size, well-composed bodily proportions, and so on”
(1993, p. 30). Later in even the most racially
polarized societies, bodily skin color became but
one mode of enculturated reference that included
“modes of dress, bearing, gait, hairstyle, speech,
and their relation” (Goldberg, 1993, p. 74).
On such distinctions black slavery and antiSemitism – to mention but two instances of
Racism – have been sustained. Even within racial
groups, variations in skin color, hair texture, and
other bodily features have been the basis on
which Class distinctions have been maintained
(see Race).
Recent Cultural theory has explicitly
emphasized the body’s semiotic qualities. For
Kristeva the first signifying process occurs in the
womb (Payne, 1993, pp. 167–70), and for
Foucault the body is the site of an unidealized
genealogical history that resists the abstractions
of origin and emergence (Foucault, 1977, p. 147).
Nevertheless, Kenneth Clark (1956) has shown
that the depiction of the nude has been a manifestation of such abstractly idealized forms, at
least since Vitruvius, and that artists have been
ready to distort grotesquely the human body in
order to make its representation conform to a
culturally specific aesthetic ideal. Even so, somatic
imagery has long been paradigmatic “for any
forced, artful, contrived, and violent study of
depths” (Stafford, 1991, p. 47). This accounts for
Foucault’s terse remark (1977, p. 154) that
“knowledge is not made for understanding: it is
made for cutting.”

body

`body 
Although it may at first seem solidly
a fixture of Nature rather than Culture, the
body is, nevertheless, both a biological entity and
a social and philosophical construct. Because it is
born, feels pain and pleasure, ages, and dies, the
physical body can never be completely appropriated by the Symbolic order. Although it may be
“foundational of all symbolism” (Brooks, 1993,
p. 7), the body is also precultural and prelinguistic.
Whatever is not of the body, however, seems to
demand that it be thought of in terms of the body.
Thus, the poet William Blake in The Marriage of
Heaven and Hell (1794) could refer to it as “the
chief inlet of the soul in this age.” As soon as the
body becomes an object of thought, it is reshaped
by the Ideology of Discourse. Accordingly,
Peter Brown (1988, pp. 9–11) has demonstrated
that early Christians commonly thought of
women as “failed males” because their bodies
had not managed during coagulation in their
mothers’ wombs to amass the same quantities of
heat and spiritual vitality that made men what they
were. Just as the warmth of semen demonstrated
the vital achievement of the male body, so menstruation was a sign of the failure of the female
to process heat, which coagulated when it was
not used. Still, a woman’s surplus energy was
necessary for its intended use in the nurturing of
children, which did not, however, restrain Galen
from observing that “the Creator had purposefully
made one half of the whole race imperfect, and
as it were, mutilated” (De usu partium, 14.6).
The theory of female heat at least was a gesture
toward overturning the idea spoken by no less
than Apollo in Aeschylus’s Eumenides that only
the father is the true parent, the mother’s body
being merely an incubating receptacle of the
male seed (see Reproductive technology).
Perhaps with a sense of irony Shakespeare
invoked some of this ancient anatomical theory
to imply (in Sonnet 129) that spirit is conveyed by semen. He often plays, too, with the
convention that the temperament of human
beings is determined by the prominence of one
of four fluids or “humours:” blood, phlegm,
choler, or melancholy. The dominant humour was
determined by the sign under which a person was
born (Tillyard, 1943).
During the Enlightenment, as David Theo
Goldberg has shown, classical values of bodily
beauty were resurrected and equated with

`bolekaja criticism
A term by which Chinweizu and Madubuike identify the corrective
struggle of “men and of nations” with “the
stiflers of their life” (1983). In Yoruba bolekaja
means “Come down let’s fight!” However, there
is far more to bolekajarism than intellectual
pugilism.
Committed to afrocentric cultural nationalism,
“Issues and tasks,” the final chapter of Toward
the Decolonization of African Literature is a manifesto for African Literary production and
interpretation. Earlier chapters consist of resolute
critiques of the universalist assumptions of
“eurocentric criticism” of African fiction and
poetry. In contrast to eurocentrism, they propose
a “supportive” role for the critic.
Supportive criticism provides writer and audience with the knowledge of “things valued in
traditional African orature.” A principal term in
this Hermeneutics of support is imitation: just
as writers must rely on African oral Discourse
to simulate “the flavor of African life,” so
critics should sustain their efforts by providing
them with the raw material – “knowledge of
things valued in traditional African orature, and
why” – of their craft. Given their stress on oral
discourse, their preference for “20th-century
diction and idiom,” and their insistence on the
autonomy of African literature, it is hardly surprising that Chinweizu, Jemie, and Madubuike
decry the impact of the “anglo-modernist sensibility” on some African poets and approve of the
pursuit of traditionalism in others.
Bolekaja criticism has been called an “ethnic
model” for its insistence on the “cultural
specificity” of African literature and its “pursuit
and defense of difference.” But missing from this
appraisal is the recognition that some of its political inspiration derives from nonethnic, supraethnic “imagined communities” – the nation,
the continent. Equally unacknowledged are its
other debts: its cognitive (us–them) apparatus, its
mimeticism, its (cultural) nationalist Ideology.
Many of these are owed, either directly or not, to
European history, epistemologies, and theories
of art. Bolekaja criticism is, like afrocentrism in
North America, a form of nativism. Caught in
the logic of eurocentrism, it cannot formulate a
hermeneutic by which the generic, linguistic,
and expressive eclecticism of African cultural
practices can be most productively explicated.

Since its inception at the State
University of New York at Binghamton under the
editorship of W.V. Spanos in 1972, boundary 2
has been the leading journal of the literature and
Critical theory of Postmodernism. In its
early years, the journal was a vehicle for a very
particular critique of the metaphysical bases of
aesthetic modernism which was derived from
the work of Martin Heidegger. In a number of
important articles, Spanos himself argued for a
postmodernist literature and Literary criticism which would acknowledge the open and
unfinished condition of “being-in-time,” thus
abandoning the abstract will-to-power of the
disinterested, or timeless work or critical interpretation. boundary 2 has also provided a forum
for postmodernist Poetry and fiction. More
recently, under the editorship of Paul Bové, the
journal has widened its focus to explore developments in postmodernism and attitudes towards
it outside the Anglo-American mainstream, for
example, in Ireland, Latin America, and Japan.

bracketing The name of a philosophical
method first introduced by the German philoso-

pher Edmund Husserl in and around 1905.
“Bracketing” means “putting out of operation.”
The phenomenologist, Husserl insisted, must
“bracket,” that is “suspend his belief in,” “not make
any use of” all presuppositions, all that he already
believes in, in order to be able to do presuppositionless description of experience. “Bracketing” is
not denying, nor does it amount to doubting. It
amounts to “neutralizing” one’s attitude toward
what one brackets. When you “bracket” something, something else remains outside the bracket.
Husserl called it the phenomenological “residue.”

`Braudel, Fernand (1902–85)
French historian who was first and foremost a critical
theorist, although this is a phrase he would never
have applied to himself. He regarded himself as
a historian of the longue durée, one who thought
that good history was histoire pensée, that is,
history which provided responses to serious
intellectual questions.
He is one of three towering figures of the
Annales school of history, the leader of the so-called
second generation (the first generation having
been led by its founders, Lucien Febvre and
Marc Bloch). The Annales school stood for the
coming together and mutual fructification of
history and the social sciences. It stood in opposition to all forms of mindless Empiricism,
which Braudel termed histoire événementielle. It
stood equally opposed to all structural universalisms that asserted generalizations purporting to
hold true throughout time and space. In short,
the Annales school refused to be trapped in the
Methodenstreit, rejecting equally the nomothetic
and idiographic stances. The Annales school was
thus established on the basis of a profound critique of the major methodological and substantive premises of a very large part of the writings
of historians and social scientists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Fernand Braudel made two stunning contributions to contemporary thought. They are to be
found primarily in his two great (and very large)
books: The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean
World in the Age of Philip II (1949; 2nd edition,
amplified, 2 vols, 1966); and Civilization and
Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century (1979, 3 vols).
The first contribution is the concept of multiple

Braudel, Fernand

post of Director of Studies at the Ecole Pratique
des Hautes Etudes, where he soon established the
Centre for European Sociology, which he continues
to direct. Bourdieu was appointed to a chair at
the Collège de France in 1981. Most of his publications reflect both his early engagement with
philosophy and his meticulous anthropological
fieldwork in Algeria. Like Michel Foucault and
Jacques Derrida, Bourdieu was equally suspicious
of the Existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre and
the Structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss. In
his generous but critical response to such thinkers
as Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Wittgenstein, Bourdieu finds in each of them a means
for overcoming the limitations of the others
(Jenkins, 1992, p. 19).
Bourdieu was persistently concerned with the
problem of how an ethnographer can come to
know the Culture he studies. It is not sufficient,
he argues, simply for the investigator to distance
himself from, or to objectify, the social reality he
studies; it is also necessary that he sustain a continuing critique of his methods and epistemological
Paradigms. The first critical distancing he calls
“participant objectivation,” and the second “the
objectification of objectification.” Although he
is suspicious and ironically dismissive of theory
(despite his several books and articles with “theory”
in the title), Bourdieu was attentive to the ways
that theories, often unconsciously and uncritically, determine the cultural practices of people’s
everyday lives. Doing is what makes knowing
possible, he argues (Jenkins, 1992, p. 69). A prolific writer, Bourdieu’s interests ranged from
sociological theory and education to literature, the
visual arts, and philosophy. The Logic of Practice
(1980) provides the best entrance into his work,
and there is an excellent bibliography of his
publications in In Other Words (1990).

Braudel, Fernand

social temporalities. The second contribution is
his upside-down analysis of capitalism as a mode
of production and a civilization.
The Mediterranean began as an analysis of the
regime of Philip II of Spain. In writing it, Braudel
turned the story around. It became the story
of the Mediterranean world as a (not the) worldeconomy. The hyphen in the word “worldeconomy” was crucial to Braudel, because in
French he had coined the term économie-monde
precisely to distinguish it from économie mondiale, usually translated into English as “world
economy” without the hyphen (see discussion in
Braudel, 1984, pp. 21–4).
The Mediterranean world was a world-economy
in that it had a discernible division of labor with
dominant cities and a hierarchy. It was a “world
theatre,” with boundaries and an identity, but one
that bestrode political and cultural frontiers. A
world-economy was a space–time zone with a
history. Such a conception brought to the fore the
essential intellectual question Braudel sought to
address: If a given space–time zone has a history,
indeed if the space and the time form its history
but its history defines its space and time as well,
how can one know, how can one define categories
of space and time? For most of modern thought,
space and time were just there – implacable,
unbudgeable, exogenous parameters to the lives
and actions of individuals, groups, and social
structures. One recorded the last in time and
space. Time and space were not themselves
empirical variables to study.
Braudel said no to this standard view. Time
and space were, he argued, the central empirical
variables to study, since they were social creations. He argued this by demonstration in The
Mediterranean. He argued this theoretically in
his key methodological article, “Histoire et les
sciences sociales,” published in Annales E.S.C. in
1958.
For Braudel, there were three real social temporalities and a fourth mythical one. The three
real ones he termed Structure, conjuncture, and
event, which correlated with long, medium, and
short time. Short time, histoire événementielle,
episodic history was the social temporality
explored by most historians. It was the history
of kings and battles, the history of dates and
chronology, the history of infinite contingencies.
But, said Braudel in The Mediterranean, “events

are dust.” They are dust because they matter
little and change little. And they are dust because
they prevent one from seeing the underlying real
structures.
Structures exist in the longue durée, which
may last hundreds, even thousands of years; but
they are never eternal. Structures are those continuing underlying social patterns which provide
the continuing constraints on our actions. They
may represent patterned cultural, economic, or
political modes of dealing with, and reacting to,
natural phenomena (from climate to topography
to parasites) or particular sociocultural modes of
perceiving social reality (such as world views or
normative rules governing social hierarchies).
Their crucial aspect is that, in the short run,
structures are fixed and therefore the framework
within which the impact of events is limited.
And in between structures and events lie the
conjonctures (inadequately translated into English
as conjunctures). They represent the cyclical
rhythms which are the normal fluctuations of all
structures. Most of these fluctuations are middlerun, says Braudel, constituting discernible temporary but important shifts in the global context
(such as periods of overall economic expansion
versus periods of overall economic contraction).
Braudel’s contribution was to insist that serious history, histoire pensée, was the explication
of the structures and the conjunctures, and not
of the events – and also not of that mythical
time–space, the eternal time–space of the structural universalists (the prime example cited by
Braudel being Lévi-Strauss).
Braudel has become so associated with the
concept of the longue durée that some of his
readers have failed to notice the equally critical
concept of capitalism. If The Mediterranean
was organized as a tale told three times, about
three time–spaces (structure, conjuncture, event),
Civilization and Capitalism is organized as a tale
told about three storeys in the building of economic life: the ground floor of everyday life, the
middle floor of the market, and the upper storey
of capitalism. In some ways, everyday life is akin
to structures. Braudel is speaking here of patterns
of very long duration whose reality constrains
the actions of people and institutions in the
shorter run. However, if “structures” seemed to
refer to macrophenomena (the relationship of
mountain-dwellers to plain-dwellers, the wind

`Brecht, Bertolt (1898–1956)
German playwright, poet, director, and theoretician. One of
the most influential theorists of drama in the
twentieth century, especially in England and
France, as well as in Germany, Brecht was born
in Augsburg. His career generally divides into
four stages: early plays, poems, and short stories,
and his two operas (1914–30); his Lehrstücke,
or learning plays (1930–33); plays written during
his exile from Germany (1933–48); return to
Germany, Austrian citizenship, establishment
of the Berliner Ensemble, and adaptations of
Shakespeare, Molière, and others.
Coming of age during the 1914–18 war,
Brecht studied medicine at the university in
Munich, was drafted, and suffered traumatic
experiences as a hospital orderly during the last
months of the war. As a result, he espoused
pacifism and a generally nihilistic attitude toward
life. Settling in Berlin during the chaotic years of
the Weimar Republic, he came under two main
influences, Marxism and the theater. During his
youth he had read the Manifesto and by 1926 he
was studying Das Kapital. Though he never
joined the Communist Party, he determined to
change the world in accordance with Marxist
principles. His interest in the theater, for which
he had already written two plays, led Brecht to
become an assistant to Max Reinhardt. At this
point he developed a familiarity with the work
of Erwin Piscator, a director who had evolved
a mode of theater that he called epic drama.
In 1928, Brecht produced The Threepenny
Opera, a sardonic, pessimistic view of capitalism.
The didactic plays of Brecht’s second period
followed, notably The Mother and Saint Joan of
the Stockyards, both in 1932. By this time Brecht
had become a serious student of dialectical
materialism. Censored by the National Socialists
in 1933, Brecht left Germany. After moving from
one European city to another and writing The Life
of Galileo, The Good Person of Szechwan, and
Mother Courage and Her Children, he finally left
for America in 1941. Living mainly in New York
and Los Angeles, he wrote various pieces, The

patterns, the Roman limes as a continuing cultural
boundary), the economy of everyday life seemed
to refer primarily to very microphenomena (the
patterns of cooking food, growing staples, costume,
and the use of farm animals). These patterns
provided the unspoken, unanalyzed basis of real
economic life.
The next storey, that of the market, was seen
by Braudel in a very particular way. He defined
the market as the zone of multiple buyers and sellers and therefore of “small” profits, of regularity,
and of liberation from constraints. This may not
seem exceptional, except that he quite explicitly
saw the state as having played the role historically
of preserving the freedom of the market by
regulating it.
The great enemy of the market for Braudel, what
he called the anti-market, was not the state but
capitalism. Capitalism was the opaque zone on top
of, imposed upon, the market, the zone of
“exceptional” profits via monopolies, and via the
state in so far as it was the guarantor of monopolies. Far from being regular, capitalism was
speculative. Far from being the zone of supply and
demand, capitalism was the zone of power and
cunning.
Braudel turned upside down the classical
picture of capitalism (that of both Adam Smith
and Karl Marx) as normally competitive and
only abnormally monopolistic. For Braudel, the
whole point of capitalism – real capitalism, as seen
historically in the longue durée – was the effort
to suppress the freedom of the market in order
to maximize profit.
The impact of these two critical concepts of
Braudel – multiple social temporalities and the
priority of structure and conjuncture over event;
and capitalism as the anti-market – is only now
beginning to show its impact on history and the
social sciences. Braudel represents one of the
most original readings of the modern world and
one of those most likely to form the basis of conceptual analyses in the twenty-first century.

Ensemble in 1949, for which he wrote his adaptations and directed his plays until his death.
While not agreeing with some of Piscator’s
ideas, Brecht found in his predecessor’s epic
drama a way to communicate his social ideas to
an audience, a way that the current modes of
drama failed to accommodate. Realism fell short
because, though he espoused the dramatic goal of
revealing to the audience the truth about social
conditions as he saw them, he rejected the
notion that the stage should present a mere slice
of life: peering through an imagined fourth wall
allowed a spectator to submit himself or herself
passively to a world of illusion. He needed an
audience that was actively engaged in the the
struggle against the capitalist organization and
bourgeois values of society. Brecht also opposed
naturalism because its view of the human being
revealed him or her as determined by environment,
whereas Marx had taught him that people were
capable of change. Finally, expressionism failed
to serve Brecht’s purposes because it presented
characters too subjectively. His theory of epic
theater brilliantly resolved these objections to
the drama of his day and forwarded his political
agenda.
Epic theatre had the didactic purpose of making the audience think about the social conditions
of their lives. In his notes to The Rise and Fall
of the City of Mahagonny (1929), titled “The
modern theatre is the epic theatre” (Willett,
1964, p. 37), Brecht provided a list of concepts,
dramatic techniques, and stage devices that
showed the change in emphasis from what he
termed “dramatic theater,” by which he meant
theater that followed Aristotelian principles, to
epic theater. The key items in the list point to
Brecht’s view of man’s nature, the staging of this
view, and the desired effect on the audience.
Because environment does not determine man’s
nature, his identity is not fixed. This crucial conception allowed Brecht to treat the spectators as
capable of thinking for themselves, and able to act
on their new perceptions. His desire to bring his
audience to the point of recognizing the truth
about the inequalities of society led him to use

every dramatic device at his command to effect
this goal. The corollary consisted in avoiding any
pattern of dramatic construction or staging that
frustrated his aim. Thus Brecht rejected any
aspect of performance that would create illusion,
since in his view illusion acts as a kind of narcotic
that prevents clear thinking. Emotion, too,
clouds the mind and hence must be avoided if possible. Let the play be constructed as a succession
of discrete scenes, each of which presents an
argument that is addressed to the reason. The
spectator must neither be allowed to empathize
with the characters nor be permitted to develop
an interest in an intriguing plot. Consequently,
the audience must be forced to stand outside
the action so as to become an objective observer.
For sensation, experience, and feelings, the spectator was to substitute thought, understanding,
and deci-sions. Brecht’s termed this process
Verfremdung, a word that is usually translated
as “Alienation,” but since that term often carries inappropriate overtones, others are sometimes substituted: estrangement, detachment,
or distantiation. However translated, the word
points to Brecht’s desire to make the familiar
strange. Were the spectator to perceive a character or an action as unfamiliar, even astonishing,
he or she would be able to see it with fresh eyes.
This Alienation effect (A-effect) would allow
the spectators first to escape from their social and
political conditioning, then to perceive the truth
in their social situation, and finally to act on it.
To illustrate how the epic play should be
directed and acted, Brecht wrote an essay, “The
street scene,” subtitled “A basic model for an
epic theatre” (Willett, 1964, pp. 121–9). Imagine,
writes Brecht, that a person has seen an automobile
accident and then tells others what he or she
saw. Instead of attempting to reenact the event
by impersonating the driver or the victim, he
uses an objective, reportorial style to narrate the
succession of events with an eye to revealing their
social significance. In this way, avoiding illusion
and emotion, the narrator estranges the action so
that the listeners can draw their own conclusions
about who was responsible. To achieve the A-effect,
actors in epic theater must, in like manner,
forgo impersonating character in the way that
Stanislavski advocated; they must distance themselves from the character and the action, reading
their lines as though reporting a historical event.

of vision. The tone of the music was usually
harsh, the songs sardonic and satiric, and the
lighting flat and brilliant. In short, every aspect
of Brecht’s dramaturgy was designed to establish
the alienating gest.
Some critics have pointed out that Brecht’s
instinct for drama often defeated his theory of epic
theater, that to the extent the plays have been
successful the theory has suffered accordingly.
The stage history of Mother Courage provides an
illustrative example. Brecht condemned the title
character because, as a capitalist entrepreneur, she
lives only to profit from the war. Her obsession
with buying and selling causes her to lose her three
beloved children, and at the play’s end Brecht
intended to show that, in getting back into harness to pull her wagon, she has learned nothing
from her sorrow. At the play’s first performance,
however, the audience empathized with her
noble determination to carry on and tended to
see her as a heroine. Angered, Brecht rewrote some
of the scenes so as to present Mother Courage
more unsympathetically (for example, scene 5, in
which she refuses to allow some shirts in her
stock to be used as bandages for the wounded).
In the later Berlin production, however, the
audience still did not see Courage as a villain; in
fact they pitied her. Blaming the audience for their
enslavement to Aristotelian or what he called
“culinary” theater, he gave up. Thus, while the
A-effect apparently worked well in the play’s
opening scenes, Brecht had created characters
and scenes that, toward the end of the play,
prevented distancing. The play’s last scene, in
which Kattrin dies during her successful attempt
to save the city, is almost universally seen as
tragic in its effect. Brecht finally had to admit that
some emotion could be allowed at Kattrin’s
death. The artist, the poet, and the Aristotelian
dramatist in Brecht could, then, and sometimes
did, override the theorist in him.
If we look back over all of Brecht’s statements
during his career, we can see that in fact he never
took as firm a stand on the side of instruction
as he sometimes seemed to. In fact, he always
admitted that, in some way, a play should be entertaining. During his whole life, he never stood still,
continually revising his plays and his ideas. As early
as 1926 he was asserting that if he did not “get
fun” out of his playwriting, he could not expect
his audience to have “fun” (Willett, 1964, p. 7).

Brecht, Bertolt

One of their methods might consist in addressing the audience directly, not in an effort to
solicit sympathy but with the goal of instructing
them in reasoned choices. To communicate his
social meaning, Brecht believed, following the
example of Chinese acting, that the actor had to
discover a social Gestus. Difficult to translate,
Gestus (or gest) refers to a kind of fusion of substance, attitude, and gesture: any kind of sign, song,
expression, or action. A social gest is one that allows
the audience to understand the social attitudes
and import of the scene in which it occurs. For
Brecht, so important was the social gest that he
wrote: “The object of the A-effect is to alienate
the social gest underlying every incident”
(Willett, 1964, p. 139). By way of illustration, the
story is told of an incident during Brecht’s
rehearsal of his adaptation of Marlowe’s Edward
II. In one scene Baldock betrays Edward to the
enemy by giving him a handkerchief. After many
rehearsals Brecht shouted at the actor, “Not that
way!” He then said to the actor, “Baldock is a traitor
. . . You must demonstrate the behavior of a
traitor. Baldock goes about the betrayal with
friendly outstretched arms, tenderly and submissively
handing (Edward) the cloth with broad, projecting
gestures . . . The public should note the behavior of
a traitor and thereby pay attention!” (McDowell,
1976, p. 113). Roland Barthes (1977, p. 73)
suggests the significance of the social gest:
“[T]his Brechian concept [is] one of the clearest
and most intelligent that dramatic theory has
ever produced,” and in a photo essay (1967) he
acutely analyzed seven examples from Mother
Courage.
Other alienating stage devices included the
use of posters that set forth the resolution of the
scene’s key problem as well as the time and place
of the scene. The spectator’s attention was thus
directed away from suspense and toward critical
interpretation. To further this aim, Brecht used
montage to construct the succession of episodic
scenes, so that the actors had no through-line to
follow and the audience would not be drawn
into the action. Moreover, coherent development
within each scene was interrupted so that the
social gest would be distanced (Benjamin, 1973,
p. 18), and the songs were designed to arise only
peripherally out of the situation. The musicians
played in full view of the audience and the lighting equipment was set up in the audience’s field

Brecht, Bertolt

94
Likewise, in 1927, he wrote that though epic
theater “appeals less to the feelings than to the
spectator’s reason . . . it would be quite wrong to
try and deny emotion to this kind of theatre”
(Willett, 1964, p. 23). Even so, until 1939 Brecht
held with the main goal of epic theater: to present the audience with instructive productions that
would make them think critically. Then in “On
experimental theatre” (1939) he began to see the
need for balance: “How can the theatre be both
instructive and entertaining?” (Willett, 1964,
p. 135), and in 1948, when he wrote his major
essay “A short organum for the theatre,” he
moved to full acceptance of “fun:” “From the
first it has been the theater’s business to entertain people. . . . Not even instruction can be
demanded of it” (Willett, 1964, pp. 180–1). By this
time Brecht had come to appreciate the shortcomings of his original concept of “epic theater,”
a phrase that he now understood as too vague
to express his intention. He shifted to the
descriptive phrase “theater of the scientific age”
but discarded it as being too narrow (Willett, 1964,
p. 276). He finally resorted to the designation
“dialectical theater,” though he had apparently not
settled on it by the time he died.
Brecht’s theory of drama will probably always
be referred to as “epic theater,” and the term is
useful in Signifying an objectively narrated
story intended to estrange the spectators so that
they can ponder current social conditions. At the
same time the phrase “dialectical theater” goes to
the very heart of Brecht’s practice (especially in
his later plays), as it arises out of his theoretical
assumptions, for he dramatizes each social situation as a process that is, as he wrote, “in disharmony with itself ” (Willett, 1964, p. 193). He goes
so far as to say, “The coherence of the character
is in fact shown by the way its individual qualities
contradict one another” (Willett, 1964, p. 196).
Mother Courage, for example, is by turns courageous and cowardly, tenacious and pliant, harsh
and loving. This dialectical technique appears
in virtually all elements of his plays, perhaps
most obviously in the bifurcated character Shen
Te/Shui Ta of The Good Person of Szechwan, and
in the drunk/sober Puntila of Herr Puntila and His
Man Matti. Thus the actor must always act out
what Brecht calls the “not . . . but” (Willett, 1964,
p. 137): the actor performs a certain act, but that
act must always imply “what he is not doing.” To

cite Brecht’s illustration, when the actor says,
“You’ll pay for that,” he does not say, “I forgive
you.” All words, scenes, and characters contain
their own internal contradictions. This dialectical method, then, was, from the beginning,
crucial to Brecht’s dramaturgy. In effect, Brecht
found a dramatic form appropriate to his belief
in dialectical materialism.
When collected, Brecht’s essays, speeches,
interviews, descriptions of productions, and
other writings, constitute a fully developed
theory of theater, one of the most influential,
challenging, and provocative in this century.
True, Brecht has been attacked or ignored at various times and in many places. He was of course
censored when the Nazis came to power, and even
during the 1950s, when he was working in the
German Democratic Republic, he was heavily
criticized by the Socialist Unity Party for, among
other things, not presenting “positive heroes”
(Wolfgang Emmerich, quoted in Kruger, 1994,
p. 491). In the United States Brecht’s politics
have always caused concern (see Kushner, 1989).
As for acting methods, American and British
actors (Patterson, 1994, pp. 282–3), as well as
French actors (Dort, 1990, p. 97), ap-parently
prefer Stanislavski’s method to Brecht’s A-effect.
In recent years Western Europe, except for
England, has suffered so-called Brecht-Müdigkeit
(“Brecht-fatigue”), owing, in part, to stodgy,
museum-like productions such as those of the
Berliner Ensemble (Brecht’s heirs have restricted
experimentation). Nevertheless, Brecht’s influence has been pervasive, though, it should be
said, Eric Bentley (1990) has raised serious questions on the problem of assigning influence.
The Berliner Ensemble has toured a number of
countries, for example, Poland in 1952, France
in 1954 and 1955, England in 1956, Moscow in
1957, Venice in 1966, Toronto in 1986. During
the 1970s the number of Brecht performances
in the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria,
and Switzerland outnumbered those of Schiller
and Shakespeare (Weber, 1980, p. 97). Brecht has
influenced such directors as Peter Brook, Joan
Littlewood, Andrei Serban, Roger Planchon,
Ariane Mnouchkine, Giorgio Strehler, Robert
Woodruff, and Robert Wilson, and such playwrights as John Arden, Edward Bond, David
Hare, Robert Bolt, Caryl Churchill, Peter Weiss,
Heiner Muller, Helmut Baierl, Peter Hacks,

experiencing a rebirth, augurs well. Naturally,
directors, actors, and playwrights will continue to
argue about Brecht’s ideas, and some have discarded them, but Brecht’s metatheatrical technique
and the dialectical nature of his dramatic structures, especially perhaps his rejection of essentialist
views of character, his acceptance of openendedness, and his inclusion of a critical audience,
make him indispensable. Brecht remains a major
presence, for his revolutionary dramaturgy, tied
as it is to political awareness, has changed and
enlarged our ways of perceiving theatre.

 French narratologist. Bremond interrogates the work of the
Russian structuralist Vladimir Propp on folktales.
For Bremond the structuralist critic should pay
attention to possible meanings other than those
offered by the literary work. He theorizes that
Texts contain points at which choices are made,
the plot changes, or characters develop. By using
the linguistics of Saussure, of differential relations, he sees these points as producing meaning
through the very choices which are excluded.

Scholarly interest in Brecht remains high: the
annual bibliography in Modern Drama listed 66
Brecht items in 1992, 114 in 1993. The Brecht
Yearbook, published by the International Brecht
Society, gives essays on sources, theory, and
interpretation, as well as book reviews. Critics
continue to discover productive approaches to
both theory and plays, especially along the lines
of Feminist criticism (for example, The Brecht
Yearbook, vol. 12, 1983; Diamond, 1988; Geis, 1990;
Reinelt, 1990; Laughlin, 1990; Smith, 1991); and
film study (for example, Willett, 1983; Copeland,
1987; Byg, 1990; Kleber and Visser, 1990).
Brecht’s relation to Postmodernism has been
studied by Wright (1989), Silberman (1993), and
Solich (1993). A 30-volume edition of Brecht’s
work has been under way since 1989, published
by Suhrkamp Verlag (Frankfurt) and Aufbau
Verlag (Berlin and Weimar), and the collected
plays have been published by Vintage. Issues of
journals have focused on Brecht: for example,
Tulane Drama Review, 6 (1961); The Drama
Review (TDR), 12, no. 1 (fall 1967); The Drama
Review (TDR), 24, no. 1 (fall 1980); Theatre
(Yale), 17 (spring 1986); Theatre Journal, 39
(1987); and Modern Drama, 31 (1988). The
March 1993 issue of Theatre Journal, titled
“German Theatre after the F/Wall,” examines
the state of German drama, and the situation
of Brecht in particular, since November 1989.
The fall of the Berlin Wall appears to have had,
so far, little effect per se on the way Brecht’s
theory has been perceived. True, some believe
that because Communism appears to have been
discredited, Brecht’s politics have become
irrelevant (see the discussion, pro and con, in
Eddershaw, 1991, pp. 303–4), but one might
well argue that as long as social inequity characterizes modern life, Brecht’s goal of changing
society will continue to require consideration.
The extent to which feminist and postmodern
approaches will shift our views of Brecht’s theory and practice remains to be seen. Meanwhile,

has provided financial support for the Berliner
Ensemble, which, under new management
committed to innovation “in Brecht’s spirit,” is

`bricolage
 A term associated with Claude LéviStrauss, referring to the use of a roughly suited
conceptual tool when no other means is available. In The Elementary Structures of Kinship,
Lévi-Strauss (1969, pp. 2–4) defines “nature” as
that which is universal, spontaneous, and not
dependent on a particular culture or norm; and
“Culture” as that which is dependent on a
System of socially regulating norms and which
varies from one social structure to another.
Nevertheless, having established this distinction
between nature and culture, he proceeds to discuss incest prohibition, which appears to be
both universal and natural, and normative and
cultural. Although in a sense scandalously inadequate, the nature/culture distinction is nevertheless indispensable and its use an instance of
bricolage. Derrida escalates the applicability of
the term by observing that, if bricolage is the
necessary borrowing of concepts from an incoherent or ruined heritage, then “every discourse
is bricoleur” (1978, p. 285).

`British Film Institute
 Founded in 1933 amid
bitter debate about the role of film education
and film culture in Britain. Since then, it has had
to struggle to maintain its independence as an
institution that exists essentially within the public sphere, in the face of industry pressure and
changing government policies. Throughout its
history it has played a crucial innovative role in
film culture. One of the Institute’s first responsibilities was to set up a National Film Library
(the origin of the present National Film and
Television Archive). It also took over the journal
Sight and Sound in 1934, and created an exhibition wing with the foundation of the National Film
Theatre in 1952. From its inception, the BFI has
been concemed with defining and promoting
film education and it is primarily through these
activities that its work has made a unique contribution to the development of film theory.
Intellectual innovation and debate has always
benefited from the backing and dissemination

available through the BFI’s different activities,
most particularly the film distribution library,
publishing, and the specialized information
service and book library.
In the mid-1960s the Education Department of
the British Film Insitute adopted a new, dynamic
policy toward film criticism and Film studies that
provided a crucible for emergent film theory. It
is possible to date the new initiatives from the
appointment of Paddy Whannel as the Institute’s
Education Officer in 1957. He then coauthored,
with Stuart Hall, The Popular Arts (1964), a
book whose title reflects the upheaval that his
engagement with film culture would bring to the
British Film Institute. The established approach
to film criticism at the time is evident in the
editorial policies of Sight and Sound. Sight and
Sound had, particularly after 1948 when Gavin
Lambert became editor, represented the best of
the British tradition, concentrating its critical
support and enthusiasm on the work of the
international art cinema and some exceptional
American films. It was under Whannel’s aegis that
the Hollywood studio system cinema first came
to be taken seriously in the BFI.
The collaboration that produced The Popular
Arts is, perhaps, symptomatic as both authors
came from outside the English intellectual establishment, Whannel as a working-class Scot and
Hall as an Oxford-educated Jamaican. Both were
prepared to give intellectual attention and social
analysis to cinema that had previously been at
best critically neglected, and often received with
active hostility by an elite which dismissed Hollywood as kitsch in its products and imperialist
in its domination of the international entertainment market. Whannel initiated a critical concern
with popular, particularly Hollywood, cinema
and further confounded traditional attitudes
by adopting this position with a left political
commitment.
It is of great importance to establish Paddy
Whannel’s influence on these critical changes
because he never again published. He encouraged
and sustained critical polemic and passion, but it
was his organizing energy that transformed ideas
into policies. Most of all, he collected a group
of like-minded people in the BFI Education
Department. These were the writers, administrators, and educationalists who would launch the
new approach to film theory. During the 1960s

97
debates from a rather different, more Leavisite
position, was appointed to the first of these posts
at Warwick University.
This “first wave” of film theory suffered a
setback when Paddy Whannel and a number of
his colleagues resigned their posts in 1971 over
a change in policy toward education within
the BFI. However, the Education Department
position had accumulated support and its work
continued, while other Departments forwarded
the debates through their own activities. For
instance, the critical decisions that lay behind
the collection of 16 mm prints and study extracts
enabled Hollywood cinema to be taught, seriously
and analytically, along the lines of the Education
Department policy. However, the cultural atmosphere was changing in the late 1960s, opening
the way for new developments in film theory.
The Vietnam War and the political events of
1968 shifted attention away from Hollywood
cinema, which was, in any case, going through
profound crises of its own. The BFI-funded
journal Screen continued, during this period, to
expand and elaborate the film and theory conjuncture, particularly through Althusserian
Marxism and Lacanian Psychoanalysis.
While the BFI’s work with theory continued
and consolidated in education and publishing,
from the mid-1970s interest in film theory and
Avant-garde Aesthetics started to influence
production policy. With Peter Sainsbury’s appointment as Head of the Production Board in 1976,
the potential of 16 mm film making as the basis
for an alternative cinema brought together previously uncoordinated aspirations. Although
the Production Board’s funding included films
ranging from cinema vérité to the avant-garde,
this period also produced work that attempted
to create a theoretical cinema. Once again, the
British context responded to hybrid influences,
those of the New American Cinema movement
represented, for instance, by Michael Snow and
Hollis Frampton, and the radical European
cinema represented, for instance, by Jean-Luc
Godard and Jean-Marie Straub/Danielle Huillet.
Sainsbury’s policy funded films that responded
to these trends, while also reflecting the impact
of Feminism and work on representation and
psychoanalytic theory.
The face of independent film changed in the
1980s, responding to the impact of Channel 4 as

British Film Institute

the influence of Cahiers du Cinéma had taken
root in Britain, also initiating a new interest in
Hollywood. Victor Perkins, of the Movie editorial board, and Peter Wollen, who had been
writing about Hollywood cinema from an
auteurist perspective in New Left Review under the
pseudonym Lee Russell, both joined the Education Department in 1966. It was in the subsequent
years that the Education Department’s unique
approach was hammered out at the BFI in seminars, screenings, and the enormously influential Education Department summer schools.
Although the critical problems posed by studio
system cinema were central to these debates,
so was the work of pioneer film theorists such as
Eisenstein and Bazin.
The need to develop a policy toward education,
as the basis for a future film culture, provided the
context in which questions of theory were first
addressed. While film criticism had traditionally
depended on concepts of value that were appropriate for high cultural products, particularly
those of literary criticism, films produced by
the Hollywood studio system demanded a new
form of criticism and a new approach to value.
It was out of this intellectual challenge that the
BFI Education Department turned to theories
of Semiotics and Structuralism. And it was
probably only in Britain that the passion for
Hollywood cinema could be met with French
ideas. The mix of low culture from across the
Atlantic and high theory from across the Channel
amounted to a slap in the face to traditional
Englishness that was, in many ways, characteristic of this generation and its rejection of
English isolationism and chauvinism. As the
Education Department moved into publishing,
Peter Wollen’s Signs and Meaning in the Cinema
(1969, BFI and Secker and Warburg; reissued
1972), Jim Kitses’s Horizons West (1969, BFI and
Secker and Warburg), and Colin McArthur’s
Underworld USA (1972, BFI and Secker and
Warburg) all represent these trends toward
theorization, while also continuing to address
the Cahiers issues of auteurism and genre. At the
same time, the British Film Institute funded the
first university appointments dedicated to film
studies, which were to provide the next means of
expanding these ideas to a wider constitutency and
a new generation. Robin Wood, who had played

well as to cuts in government provision of funds.
However, with coproductions, the BFI funded
many directors whose work has become synonymous with British cinema today. New funding policies were designed, by the setting up of
workshops, to create film-making opportunities
in the regions, beyond metropolitan monopoly.
The black film-making collectives (Ceddo,
Sankofa, Black Audio Film Collective, Retake)
began to produce work that extended and
reconfigured the radical and theoretical tradition
of the Production Board.
During the years of Thatcherite Conservatism,
the BFI had to lobby to maintain its policies. Its
success is confirmed by developments that have
taken place on two fronts. First of all, awareness
of film, and increasingly television, has been firmly
established in schools, widening the availability
of the theory that was pioneered in the earlier
period. Media studies are now included in the core
curiculum that must be taught in all schools.
This impetus is also reflected in the ideas and
presentation behind the BFI’s Museum of the
Moving Image, founded in 1988. Secondly, the BFI
has made a commitment to wide-ranging research
into new developments in the moving image
culture. Drawing, for instance, on its historical
collections (such as the National Film Archive,
its Library, and its other resources) the BFI’s
research initiatives can cut across the culture and
commerce divide that haunts film and television.
In 1992 the BFI established (with Birkbeck
College, London University) an MA in Film and
Television History and Theory that is now at the
heart of its research program.
The story of the BFI’s support for radical
ideas and innovations, in debate and in advance
of their establishment or acceptance, bears witness to the crucial contribution of public sector
institutions to a culture which can also affect
and inform the commercial. The year of the centenary of cinema sees the BFI working in conjunction with the film industry, and achieving a
cooperation that would have been inconceivable
at the time of the Institute’s birth, or even ten
or so years ago. At this particular moment of history, when the very concept of the “public” has
to be defended both theoretically and practically,
the BFI is finding ways of keeping its tradition
of conservation and innovation alive for future
generations.

`Brooks, Cleanth (1906–94)
 American critic.
Brooks was the chief popularizer of New Criticism. A member of the second generation of
the movement, he was not one of its seminal
thinkers, describing his work as a “synthesis” of
others’ ideas, but his student handbook Understanding Poetry (with Robert Penn Warren, 1938)
was enormously influential in spreading the
gospel of New Criticism throughout American
literature departments. Modern Poetry and the
Tradition (1939) and The Well-Wrought Urn
(1947) are the representative critical works of
the movement, and Literary Criticism: A Short
History (with William K. Wimsatt, 1957) also
became a standard text.
Modern Poetry and the Tradition was the
American equivalent of F.R. Leavis’s Revaluation (1936), an ambitious attempt to write a
“Revised History of English Poetry” in terms of
T.S. Eliot’s ideas, and simultaneously a spirited
defense of modernist poetry. Brooks’s work
aimed at a “general theory of the history of
English poetry implied by the practice of the
modern poets.” In other words, like Eliot and
Leavis, Brooks in effect read literary history
backwards, in the service of a polemic against
“the scholars, the appointed custodians of the
tradition.” Their dismissal of modern poetry
as “difficult” and overintellectual results from
their being trapped in a defunct tradition, one
which runs back to Romanticism and narrow
eighteenth-century conceptions of “the poetic.” In
order for criticism to go forward, Brooks wants
it go further back, reestablishing contact with an
earlier tradition, that of the early seventeenth
century, and reversing the process which “broke
the tradition of wit.”
There is a “significant relationship between
the modernist poets and the seventeenthcentury poets of wit.” Both groups use a poetic
language which expresses “mature” and “complex”

was written between the English Civil War and
T.S. Eliot. “The ‘new criticism’, so called, has
tended to center around the rehabilitation of
Donne, and the Donne tradition” but now critics should look further afield and seek “paradox”
elsewhere too. He now found it in Wordsworth
(who had been described in Modern Poetry as
“inimical to intellect”), in Keats, and even in
Tennyson (“perhaps the last English poet one
would think of associating with the subtleties of
paradox and ambiguity”).
The increase in flexibility was welcome. Nevertheless, this was still an extraordinarily blinkered
way of reading English poetry, and, despite the
interest and subtlety of many of Brooks’s individual
close readings, it has not survived as a critical or
historical theory.

 British scholar
of comparative studies who brings polarities
from literary theory (that is, Connotation/

bear on the discipline of art history. In Word and
Image, for example, Bryson examines French
painting from LeBrun to David not as a succession of styles but as an interaction between the
Discursive and the Figural. This view permits,
for example, the painting of Chardin to be
viewed not as a bad fit in the rococo style, but as
a blend of the discursivity of LeBrun and the
figurality of Watteau.

attitudes, especially ironic ones, fusing intellect
and feeling, as Eliot had described Donne. The
greater part of the book is a demonstration of how
the poet who has mastered this “serious wit” “is
constantly remaking his world by relating into an
organic whole the amorphous and heterogenous
and contradictory.” Brooks makes a strong case
although it is also one which now looks alarmingly exclusive, since it suggests that all the poets
between Donne and Eliot, lacking “wit” in this
very special definition, were purveyors of simpleminded emotion or equally simple-minded
rationalism.
The other questionable aspect of Brooks’s
essay derives from the fact that it is something
much more than a revisionist literary history.
Like his mentors Eliot, Richards, Ransom, and
Tate, and like Leavis, Brooks is out to promote
a particular vision of modern history, and it is a
melodramatically gloomy and Spenglerian one. He
endorses Allan Tate’s descriptions of “our present
disintegration,” in which the mass of the population live experientially chaotic lives. He quotes
with enthusiasm Eliot’s snobbish description
of “the ordinary man’s experience” as “chaotic,
irregular, fragmentary” (in contrast to the mind
of the witty ideal poet, which “is constantly
amalgamating disparate experience”), and when
he applies his Eliotic “test” of good poets – “the
scope and breadth of experience which their
poetry assimilates” – not just to poetry but to the
reading public, he comes to “a strange and perhaps illuminating conclusion, namely that it is the
public which inhabits the Ivory Tower, separating its emotional life . . . from the actual world.”
A strange conclusion indeed, and one which
throws doubt on Brooks’s (and the New Critics’)
whole enterprise.
The Well-Wrought Urn was published in 1947.
In between the two books the 1939–45 war had
intervened, and, according to Brooks, had led to
increased attacks on the “difficulty” of modernist poetry. He therefore returned to the fray, with
even more aggressive claims. Paradox replaced
Irony and wit as the key term, and the book opens
with the sweeping assertion that “paradox is the
language appropriate and inevitable to poetry.”
The tactic was now different, however. Realizing
perhaps that this criterion would yield an even
narrower definition of the one true tradition,
he conceded that some poetry worth reading

`Burke, Kenneth (1897–1993)
 American literary critic. Although Burke is usually considered
a liter-ary critic – he has even been hailed as
the foremost critic since Coleridge – his own
definition of his project was that it constituted an
investigation into symbolic motivations and
linguistic action in general (Burke, 1966, p. 494).
Burke was a prolific writer, translator, poet,
short-story writer, and novelist. By concentrating
much of his attention on the effects of texts on
their audience, he both expanded and refined
the art of rhetoric. The fierce independence of his

thought, however, greatly limited his influence.
His theoretical interests, which distinguish him
from the New criticism, ranged from Psychoanalysis and linguistics to Marxism and pragmatism; but he was not systematically responsive
to any of those disciplines. Nevertheless, as a
model of the committed intellectual in America
at a time when both political commitment and
intellectualism were suspect, he has a secure place
in the history of American letters. Critical assessments of his work are likely to be either fulsome
or dismissive. His last major book, Language as
Symbolic Action (1966), provides an excellent
retrospective of his work.

`Cage, John Milton (1912–92)
 Musician,
born in Los Angeles, California. An influential
composer and a leading figure in the experimental art movements of the last half of the twentieth
century, his compositions and ideas using chance,
silence, and nonintentionality challenged the way
music was made and heard. He wrote music in
a variety of styles and investigated a vast array
of compositional forms and methods of composing. His work extended beyond music to the
areas of dance, painting, art, philosophy, and
Poetry. His collaborators and friends included
dancer Merce Cunningham, visual artists Robert
Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Marcel Duchamp,
pianist David Tudor, composers Pierre Boulez,
Karlheinz Stockhausen, Morton Feldman, Christian Wolff, and Earle Brown.
Several individuals were important in Cage’s
early musical and intellectual development. In the
early 1930s he studied composition with Henry
Cowell at the New School in New York and with
Arnold Schoenberg in Los Angeles. In 1938 and
1939 he worked with Bonnie Bird’s dance company at the Cornish School in Seattle and there
met Merce Cunningham, with whom he was to
collaborate for the rest of his life, and for whose
dance company he wrote numerous compositions.
During the mid-1940s Cage began a serious study
of non-Western thought. He studied Indian philosophy with the musician Gita Sarabhai, who
introduced him to the writings of Ramakrishna.
In the late 1940s Cage studied Zen Buddhism with

Daisetz T. Suzuki at Columbia University in
New York. In 1951 he was given a copy of the
Chinese Book of Changes, the I Ching, by
Christian Wolff. That Text proved important
for Cage’s thought and was used by him to assist
the chance operations and compositional decisions
required for many of his musical scores and
writings. While these individuals and events
helped shape his early life, his work with
Schoenberg (although rather brief) produced
several life-forming decisions and numerous
interesting and often repeated anecdotes. Cage
returned in 1934 to Los Angeles from New York
and sought out Schoenberg, who agreed to give
him lessons but only if he was ready to commit
his life to music. Cage said that he was and he
moved back to Los Angeles and began studying
counterpoint with Schoenberg. Schoenberg
expressed strong reservations about Cage’s
musical abilities. While he found Cage to be “an
inventor of genius” he did not feel he had the
necessary talents or proper sense of harmony to
be a composer. On being confronted with this
depressing prognosis about his musical future,
Cage felt even more determined to push ahead.
Schoenberg told him that he would reach a point
where he would hit a wall and be unable to go
any further. Cage’s reply was that then he would
spend his life banging his head against that wall.
He had promised Schoenberg that he would
devote his life to music and that is what he
would do. And so he did. His complete catalogue

of compositions numbers over 200. A list of
the most important would include: Credo in Us
(1942), Sonatas and Interludes (1948), Williams
Mix (1952), 4′33″ (1952), HPSCHD (1969),
Roaratorio (1979), and Europeras 1 & 2 (1987).
During his life he was internationally honored,
receiving numerous artistic awards, and was
commissioned by many of the most important
orchestras and performing companies in the
world. He authored several books including
Silence (1961), A Year from Monday (1967),
and Empty Words (1979); and he created many
visual works, including 17 Drawings by Thoreau
(1978), Ryoku (1985), and Eleven Stones (1989).
He was the Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer at
Harvard in 1988–9; those lectures, published
in 1990 under the title I–VI, provide the best and
most extensive example of a form of his poetic
writing, a form he titled mesostic.
While original and provocative in much of
what he did, Cage’s work has roots in the early
American artistic and intellectual traditions. In
particular, his interests in experimentation and
stretching the limits of human expression and artistic experience have important precedents in the
music of Charles Ives and the writings of Henry
David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The
following quotation might have come from any
one of them: “let me remind the reader that I am
only an experimenter. Do not set the least value
on what I do, or the least discredit on what I do
not, as if I pretended to settle anything as true or
false. I unsettle all things. No facts are to me sacred;
none are profane; I simply experiment, an endless seeker, with no Past at my back” (“Circles,”
Emerson). Cage’s delight in experimentation can
be traced to his father, a self-employed inventor
who created one of the first submarines. On
numerous occasions, Cage acknowledged this
influence of his father and told the story of his
destined-to-be-rejected submarine. “Dad is an
inventor. In 1912 his submarine had the world’s
record for staying under water. Running as it did
by means of a gasoline engine, it left bubbles on
the surface, so it was not employed during
World War I” (Silence, Wesleyan University
Press, 1961, p. 12).
The experimental nature of Cage’s work was
often the direct result of factual necessity. His own
limits, for instance, as a traditional composer
(which Schoenberg had noted) forced him to

investigate individual sounds and sustained
duration of sound in ways others had not, and to
give less importance to the standard relationships
and harmony between sounds, and thereby to
imagine and explore different ways of structuring
the temporal dimension of music. It was physical
limitations that brought about his invention of
the prepared piano. Not having enough room on
a stage for more than a standard piano yet needing sound the piano could not produce led Cage
(in the late 1930s) to experiment with altering the
sound of the piano. He placed bolts and nuts
and strips of rubber on and between the strings
inside the piano, thereby producing new possibilities of sound for the standard instrument.
(Some of his most beautiful music was written for
the prepared piano, for example, The Perilous
Night (1943–4) and Sonatas and Interludes.) For
Cage, the limits and necessities of our world are
best treated as occasions for experimentation
and opportunities to attempt new things that
have not been tried before. Much of his devotion
to experimentation was due to his belief that the
obstacles and restrictions of our lives should be
turned to our advantage rather than accepted as
reasons for failure.
Experimenting with and composing for the
prepared piano produced not only variable and
new sounds, a new versatility, for this traditional
instrument, but also made Cage realize that he
had less control over the final sounds of the
compositions he wrote for this new instrument.
This understanding led to an interest in other kinds
of compositions where the resulting sounds
would be variable with each performance. He
thus began to experiment with indeterminate
composition by means of chance operations, a
form of composition that was to mark his work
like no other and was to cause many a former
friend and colleague, like Boulez, to no longer
feel comfortable with his work. The use of
chance operations was not intended to introduce
arbitrariness into musical performance, but to
remove the decisions of the composer from the
last stage of creation. Removing the personal
desires and choices of the composer by chance
operations was not intended to produce uncalculated acts of composition or a preference for
random performances. If we simply do anything
we wish in an arbitrary fashion, then we rely on
memory or feelings or whatever is part of us at a

103
chance, and silence are important ingredients
and expressions of Cage’s anarchistic way of
composing and living. He sought to give all
sound an equal footing and hearing in our lives;
and he tried to compose and live so as “not to
interfere with the music that is continuously
going on around us.” His was a music that
expressed the natural goodness and livability of
our ordinary lives.
Cage’s work created and creates much controversy. One of the recurring conflicts is often
presented as that between his music and his
ideas (or his philosophy). Although such a
dichotomy is almost inevitably used in writings
about Cage (it is used several times in this present discussion), it can be quite misleading, and
it has produced an important controversy in the
ways we listen to, talk about, and write about
Cage’s work. There tend to be two somewhat
extreme sides on this issue: one says “they can’t
stand his music but his ideas are important,”
and the other asserts “Cage was first and foremost
a composer, not a philosopher, and to concentrate on his ideas is to demean and devalue
his compositions.” James Pritchett has usefully
reanimated this discussion and overlays his text
on Cage with the controversy. He insists that
Cage be treated as a composer and that attempts
to make him a philosopher simply undermine
understanding him. He writes, “it has been stated
on various occasions by various authorities that
Cage was more a philosopher than a composer,
that his ideas were more interesting than his
music.” However, asserts Pritchett, “Cage-asphilosopher is . . . an image that will not bear
close scrutiny” and so he returns to what he says
is “the obvious: Cage was a composer” (Pritchett,
The Music of John Cage, pp. 1–3).
These two positions permeate much of the
writing and talk about Cage. Choosing between
them fairly easily leads to a preference for the
second approach. It is difficult not to agree that
without a healthy dose of listening to Cage and
experiencing numerous of his compositions, one
is not in a very good position to talk about his work
(this seems obvious but is not so in discussion
about Cage). However, that position does not
finally leave one satisfied for it simply overstates
the point. If one ignores or downplays the philosophy in Cage’s work, then one is apt to miss
questions and reflections embodied in the music

given moment, whereas the use of carefully
calculated chance operations provides an objective procedure for choosing the sounds for a
composition. In much of his (especially later)
work Cage sought a context of nonintentionality
and removal of the personal self, and escape
from the choices and desires of the self, a divorcing of the final product of composition from the
conscious desires of the composer, and a coming
to live with the silence (all the sounds we do not
intend) of our world.
Silence was another important part of Cage’s
music. It was for him “all the sounds we don’t intentionally make,” and that which opens us fully to
the world. It breaks the barrier between world and
art in such a way that we no longer know the difference between them, and necessitates an active
rather than a passive listener. Silence leads us out
of the world of art and into the whole of life. It is
not the opposite of sound, but the encompassing
of all sound. The silence of the world was the music
most preferred by Cage. “If you want to know the
truth of the matter, the music I prefer, even to
my own and everything, is what we hear if we are
just quiet” (Kostelanetz, 1988, p. 23).
The desire to encompass all sound (silence)
is most fully expressed in Cage’s most talked
about and notorious composition: 4′33″. It is
a piece, originally written in three movements
and later adopted for any duration, consisting of
four minutes and thirty-three seconds (a time
determined by chance operations) of silence.
The piece is the sounds that naturally happen
during the time of performance; it is those
sounds that occur in the concert hall (people
moving, chairs squeaking) and in the outside
environment (car horns honking, wind blowing)
that make their way to the audience’s ears. Most
fully of all his compositions it represents his love
and respect for the world as it is. 4′33″ expresses
Cage’s feeling that the main question before us
is “How quickly will we say yes?” to our lives.
Such a question uncovers another important
interest of Cage, that of anarchism. A fundamental assumption of anarchism for Cage was that
people are generally good and capable of taking
care of themselves without hierarchical arrangements of their lives by others. In order to write
music the way he did, Cage said you have to
assume that people are good and able to take care
of and think for themselves. Experimentation,

which are capable of producing valuable thoughts
about the nature of sound and provocations about
how we live our lives, important parts of Cage’s
interest. The philosopher in us all benefits from
listening to Cage. When we, for instance, listen to
many of his compositions and hear (encounter)
his idea that things need to be themselves and
that our cravings for establishing relationships
between things are best given up, we experience
possible life-shaping challenges. (In different
language it might be said that we hear how
Cage’s metaphysics places epistemology, or how
his concerns with the nature of being establish and
remove contexts for our attempts at knowing.)
Cage’s music encourages a reshaping of the questions we ask about music, our world, ourselves,
and that is a philosophical enterprise. His music
usually exemplifies rather than informs but what
it exemplifies must not be ignored. Attempts to
dismiss Cage the musician or Cage the philosopher
fail in a similar way. The second encourages and
tolerates a narrowness about philosophy and
Cage that we need not accept, whereas the first
assumes and works with a conception of music
and ideas that unnecessarily confines us. Both positions, however, importantly uncover a question
that naturally and inevitably must be confronted
in facing Cage: Can ideas and sounds be separated?
(Can philosophy and music be themselves?) It is
not hard to guess that Cage knew we unhesitatingly answer yes, rather than silently admitting we
do not know.

`Cahiers du Cinéma
 Spanning more than four
decades and composed of well over 400 issues,
Cahiers du Cinéma has earned its place as one
of the most influential and controversial journals
of film criticism. Even today, the journal owes
much of its reputation to the early days of its
existence when, at the height of its popularity,
Cahiers du Cinéma had a circulation of 13,000.

As George Lellis, one of many writers to devote
a whole text to analyzing the journal, observes,
“Cahiers du Cinéma in the early 1980s is hardly
the monolithic force it was in the late 1950s or
early 1960s.” In 1951 Lo Duca, André Bazin, and
Jacques Doniol-Valcroze jointly edited the first
issue. Within a few years, a group of young film
critics who were later to become major directors
of French New Wave cinema – Claude Chabrol,
Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer,
François Truffaut – joined the magazine as regular contributors. In 1954 Truffaut submitted
an essay, “Une certaine tendance du cinéma
français,” in which he introduced his politique des
auteurs, the theory widely held within the Cahiers
circle that a film bears the mark of the director,
the film’s true author (auteur). The notion itself
was not entirely new; years earlier, an article
in Revue du Cinéma, a forerunner of Cahiers
du Cinéma, expressed a similar idea. But with
Truffaut’s article, the idea exploded onto the
Cahiers agenda. Entwined in the auteur theory,
mise en scène, a focus on the composition of
individual shots rather than the effect created by
cutting together many shots, became another
central concept in the journal. Critics of Cahiers
du Cinéma have complained that the journal
gave too much credit to a select group of French
and American directors experimenting with the
auteur theory, and at least one American critic,
John Hess, faults the journal for its partiality to
films which are too much alike, all representing
more or less the same world view.
For several reasons, the tone of the journal
changed during the early 1960s until it was only
a ghost of its earlier image. Some critics today
suggest that, as the auteurs of the 1950s died or
retired from film making, Cahiers writers were
forced to turn elsewhere for subjects of their
criticism. And, as the original critics began
pursuing careers as directors – experimenting
firsthand with the auteur theory and mise en
scène – a new group of critics, more academic than
the first, altered the journal’s tone. Cahiers du
Cinéma went through a slow time in the early
1960s; Godard suggested in 1962 that it no longer
had any new ideas, that everyone simply agreed
with each other. However, as the journal reacted
to the French political turmoil of 1968, it stirred
controversy anew. The controversy reached even
the editorial board in 1969, when the journal

`Camera Obscura
 Founded in 1974 by four
women experimenting with feminist socialism
and keenly interested in the relation between
women and the cinema, especially Avantgarde and experimental films made by women,
Camera Obscura reflects the changing theoretical
beliefs of its creators. Janet Bergstrom, Sandy
Flitterman, Elisabeth Hart Lyon, and Constance
Penley joined the editorial board of Women and
Film one year before founding Camera Obscura.
“The need to begin a new review arose out of
longstanding and seemingly unresolvable controversies within Women and Film,” they wrote
in 1979. Camera Obscura provided a fresh outlet
for their theories and a chance to practice a form
of feminist socialism. For the first two years, the
four women acted idealistically as a single unit,
signing all of their work, whether created individually or by the team, as the Camera Obscura

Collective. By 1976, the same year in which
Women and Film finally collapsed, forcing Camera
Obscura to adopt the task of announcing information about women’s film activities in a section
entitled “Women Working,” the founding editors
realized that the collective model was not appropriate to their journal. In a later issue they wrote
(collectively) that much of the audience of their
first issue found the effect to be “monolithic” and
to discourage the contributions of others beyond
the editorial collective. For another decade the editorial collective still presided over the journal. In
1986 the editorial collective, minus Flitterman who
left the journal in 1978, became simply “editors.”
The editors still collaborate on the occasional
article, but they now sign their own names, or
combination of names, to most articles.
The editors of Camera Obscura have used their
journal as a place for writing about and experimenting with theories and ideologies. In their
editorial for the fifth issue (Spring 1980), for
example, their emphasis on feminism and the
classical film, subjects which recur in issue upon
issue, is undeniable: “it is clearly important for
our project on the analysis of women and representation to understand the functioning of the
structural and symbolic role of sexual difference
in the classical film.” As with any journal so
firmly planted in Ideology, Camera Obscura has
not been free of criticism. The Camera Obscura
editors admit openly their reverence for Jean-Luc
Godard’s work; a triple issue (Nos 8–9–10, Fall
1982) is dedicated to a review of his recent work.
But one critic, James Roy MacBean, writing for
Quarterly Review of Film Studies, while pleased with
some of the insights he finds in an otherwise
“uneven volume,” faults the editors for their
“relative narrowness” in interpreting one of
Godard’s films. He accuses the editors, and is
probably justified in doing so, of creating a
“fictional world built up by the narrative” rather
than interpreting the actual events of the film.
Yet even after delivering some caustic blows,
MacBean ends his comments with a bit of
deserved flattery: “the Camera Obscura editors,”
he writes, “have made a significant contribution
. . . to our ongoing appraisal of the work of JeanLuc Godard.” One might also claim that the
editors have made a significant contribution to
feminism and film theory.

changed ownership as the result of irreconcilable
conflicts within the board. Around this time,
Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes, and Christian
Metz joined the board and pushed the journal into
new areas. In the post-1968 era, Cahiers du
Cinéma, deeply influenced by Brecht, presented
a highly politicized and theoretical agenda of
an increasingly militant tone, a marked contrast
to its 1950s reverence for Hollywood auteurs.
Cahiers du Cinéma supported the argument that
commercial films reflect the dominant Ideology

Canadian studies

`Canadian studies 
Canadian studies consists
of a body of work which treats Canadian society
and Culture as its subject. It is to be distinguished
from works by Canadians, such as those of Harry
Johnson (economics) or Northrope Frye (literary criticism) which have contributed to general
knowledge or to their individual disciplines.
Considered thus, Canadian studies is only about
25 years old, although many of the most important works which comment on, or which are
descriptive of, Canadian culture and society were
written or created decades before the late 1960s.
It also follows that the work to be included
should not be limited to that of Canadians but
must also include the considerable body of work
done by non-Canadian scholars.
Perhaps the event which was most crucial to
the birth of Canadian studies was US participation in the war in Vietnam and the concomitant
reaction to it by many Canadian intellectuals.
Owing to the physical proximity to the United
States and to an intense debate about Canada’s
role in that conflict, there was a profound examination of Canada as a nation and a serious
effort to discern what was distinctive about
Canada, and indeed, what differentiated it specifically from the United States.
This quest for Canadian uniqueness was further
stimulated by publication of a study by Ronald
and Paul Wonnacott extolling the benefits of a
free trade pact between Canada and the United
States, a work which gave birth to a vast number
of specialized and econometric studies promoting
this scheme. For the rapidly growing Canadian
nationalist movement continental free trade was
synonymous with de facto absorption of Canada
into its larger neighbor, a perception such a policy
measure would have on the Canadian economy.
The reaction of Canadians to these threats to
their sense of self spanned the political spectrum.
The Tory-heroic vision to Donald Creighton’s biography of Canada’s first Prime Minister, John A.
Macdonald (1952 and 1955), George Grant’s
Lament for a Nation (1965), and poet Dennis
Lee’s Civil Elegies (1968) was matched on the left
by the work of economists Mel Watkins, Kari
Levitt, and Abraham Rotstein, and by a long list
of cultural nationalists. Liberal historian Frank
Underwood had earlier provided a metropolitanbased alternative for Canada to American
historian Frederick Jackson Turner’s “frontier

thesis” and, with The Vertical Mosaic (1965),
John Porter gave a Canadian counter to the
American “melting pot,” one which was later to
give rise to the Department of Multicultural
Affairs of the national government.
From the American Revolution onwards, many
Canadians had always seen their nation as an
alternative to their southern neighbor; an alternative which had its basis in Canada’s origins as
a colony of France and then of England. Many
aspects of the social institutions, the law, and the
culture of Quebec, which retained a distinctly
non-North American character, and Canada’s
parliament, preference for political evolution
rather than revolution, and the less individualistic social values were appreciated for their nonUS character. However, as the post 1939–45 war
realities of national power and the feasibility of
international linkages with the United Kingdom
became apparent, the power of these colonial
identifications weakened markedly.
The universities became a central battlefield
between those who sought to hire faculty according to their traditional practices and those who,
endorsing the work of Robin Mathews and
James Steele (“The universities: take-over of the
mind,” 1970), held that these traditional practices
resulted in far too many foreign professors and
far too many classes with little or no “Canadian
content.” The year 1975 saw publication of the
so-called Symons Report (To Know Ourselves), in
which a plea was made that increased curricular
attention and funding be given to the study
of Canadian society and culture at all levels of
Canadian education. This proposal was instrumental in gaining support for Canadian studies
both in Canada, through the office of the Secretary of State, and internationally, through the
Department of External Affairs. The Secretary
of State supports Canadian studies at all levels
of education within Canada, and, among its
other activities, it issues an extensive listing of
curricular materials and publications relating to
Canadian studies.
The Canadian studies community has developed
into an extensive network of national associations in 16 countries in all parts of the world,
including China, Japan, India, and Russia, as
well as the major nations of North America and
Europe. The International Council for Canadian
Studies (located in Ottawa) has served the needs

107
dominated until recently by the need to come to
terms with the forest, lakes, prairies, and mountains in which Canadians lived their lives. Cities
were secondary. The Group of Seven painters
portrayed the landscape as awesome and indifferent, but engaging in ways which were quite unlike
that of painting in England, France, or the United
States. Canadian writers, such as Gabrielle Roy
(The Tin Flute, 1945), had often set their works
in Canada’s cities, but for Canadianists more of
the Canadian psyche, at least in its Anglophone
version, was to be found in the rural settings of
the novels of W.O. Mitchell (Who Has Seen
The Wind, 1974), Margaret Lawrence (The Stone
Angel, 1964), Rudy Wiebe (The Temptations of
Big Bear, 1973), and Robert Kroetsch (Studhorse
Man, 1970), the short stories of Alice Munro,
or in poetry such as Douglas LePan’s “A country
without a mythology” (1953). Indeed several
important writers, such as Margaret Atwood
(Surfacing, 1972), Marian Engel (Bear, 1976),
and Aritha van Hirk (Tent Peg, 1981), give their
primary characters a profound experience with the
wilderness. Following Gabrielle Roy, writers in
the French language of recent decades, such as
Roger Lemellin (The Town Below, 1948), MarieClaire Blais (A Season in the Life of Emmanuel,
1965), and Jacques Godbout (Knife on the Table,
1965) have tended to place their works in the
urban settings of Montreal or Quebec City.
In the social sciences physical space had also
had a dominant influence, with the “staples
approach” of Harold Innis shaping the understanding Canadians had about the development
and functioning of their economic and political
institutions. The nation-building policies of the
national government during the nineteenth century, known as National Policy (1879), focused
policy initiative on establishing control over the
land mass north of the 49th parallel, in competition with an expansionist United States, setting
and establishing claim to the national territory,
and producing and marketing its primary products. Immigration led to the strong and concentrated ethnic communities, especially in the
West, which became Porter’s mosaic.
Beyond Canada’s borders, the country was
seen as a small relatively developed nation where
one could observe and evaluate experimentation
with flexible exchange rates, or metropolitanwide governance, or modifications of social

Canadian studies

of these member associations since 1981. Most
of the associations have their own journals and
conferences. Much of the network receives some
financial support from the Department of External
Affairs, in addition to funding from foreign
universities, foundations, and corporations.
The first (1971), and the largest (with 1,500
members), of the national associations was the
Association for Canadian Studies in the United
States. Given the proximity of the United States
to Canada, the political and sovereignty concerns of Canadians since the late 1960s, and the
interest in cross-border issues, it is perhaps
natural that scholars in the United States should
have been the first to give attention to Canadian
studies. Strong associations soon followed in
the United Kingdom (1975), France (1976), Italy
(1977), and the German-speaking countries
(1980), as well as in Canada itself (1973).
Canadian studies has had a checkered existence
in Canada, as the study of Canada permeates
much of what traditional scholars in Canada do.
It has also been argued, more as an assertion
than as a proven hypothesis, that support for
Canadian studies abroad diverts funding from
non-Canadian studies scholarship at home.
Others have argued that scholarship done outside
Canada is of lower quality than that done by
Canadian scholars. But this argument is not
unique to Canadian studies, and in addition one
must evaluate the objectives of non-Canadian
scholars as well as the impact of scholarship done
abroad, both on the understanding internationally of Canada as a culture and a society and on
Canada’s perceived status abroad. Being accepted
in international organizations as an important
member has long been an objective of Canada’s
foreign policy, and one can argue that being seen
as a nation with an internationally recognized
literature and art, and as an important subject of
social science research contributes toward that end.
It is in recognition of this fact that the mandate
for support for Canadian studies outside Canada
has been given to the Department of External
Affairs, rather than to the Secretary of State or the
Canadian Council.
It has long been stated that Canada is long on
geography and short on history. An exaggeration
to be sure but topography, space, and climate have
had powerful influences on all disciplines which
examine Canada. Both literature and Art were

canon

108
welfare systems, or other policies which subsequently might be adopted elsewhere.
Since the the 1914–18 war, public policy
scholars have given much attention to Canada’s
distinctive international role. In international
relations Canada has been portrayed as the primary
example of a “middle power” which is uniquely
able to play a constructive role in international
peacekeeping through its participation in several
United Nations forces. Political scientists are
intrigued with Canada as the smaller participant,
with the United States, in a “disparate dyad,” in
which the small country must seek to further
its own national interest and sovereignty while
linked powerfully with a large partner. Economists
have found Canada to be a superb economy
for study of the impacts of trade liberalization,
especially on a regional basis with the United
States and now with Mexico. For constitutional
specialists, Canada’s efforts to resolve its considerable tensions aver minority language rights,
its never-ending federal–provincial and regional
power-sharing disputes, its land claims disputes
with native peoples, and its recent implementation of a Charter of Rights have made Canada a
stimulating subject of study.
During the past decade some of these original
conceptualizations of Canadian studies have
broken down, largely owing to the fact that
Canadian culture and society themselves have
been transformed. This is seen most clearly in
the growth of importance of Canada’s major
cities in relation to the forest, prairies, and small
towns which had earlier captured the attention of
Canadianists. Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver
have become exciting internationally engaged
cities, contrasting with their dowdy, dull, and
parochial images of earlier years. As a consequence, Canadian painting has become more
fully integrated in international movements
(Jean-Paul Riopelle and Emile Borduas), writers
such as Robertson Davies, Margaret Atwood,
and Michael Ondaatje have chosen urban settings
for their works of fiction, and social scientists
have focused their attention more on urban
economies, manufacturing, and business and
financial services, and less on agriculture and
staples development. Native Americans have
emerged from the landscape to become a distinct
community and voice, and a powerful political
force which can no longer be overlooked.

As a consequence of this, Canadian studies
has expanded in focus beyond literature, history,
political economy, and geography to include
such specialized areas such as comparative urban
development, the rights of native peoples, environmental policies, feminist literary and social
criticism, cross-border policy issues and constitutional reform. However, in all of these areas the
reality of the Canadian culture and society which
is being studied continues to be marked by the
country’s “northernness,” its proximity to the
United States, its French and English colonial
past, its geographic dimensions and characteristics, its distinctiveness as a player on the world’s
political stage, and the sociological characteristics
of its population.

canon A collection or list of texts that are
thought to be inspired or authoritative. Following from its primary definition of “canon” as “a
rule, law, or decree of the Church; esp. a rule laid
down by an ecclesiastical Council,” the Oxford
English Dictionary (OED) defines the term in a
second sense, which in English has been used
since 1382, as “the collection of books of the
Bible accepted by the Christian Church as genuine and inspired” and by analogy (since 1870)
as “any set of sacred books.” Although it is
tempting to link the primary and secondary
definitions of “canon” by assuming that the New
Testament, for example, came into being by a rule
laid down by an ecclesiastical Council’s determination of a restrictive list of texts, the historical
process was quite otherwise. Nevertheless, much

`Caribbean studies
 The Caribbean is that
archipelago of countries curving gently from the
tip of Florida in the north to the northernmost
point of the South American continent. Its
complex geopolitics allows for the inclusion of
Guyana and arguably Venezuela as Caribbean
territories, although they are part of the South
American continent rather than islands. Its
ideological and political diversity allows for the
inclusion of Cuba. A history of Conquistadorial
acquisitiveness, slavery, indentureship, colonialism, and the socioeconomic fallout from a
declining empire has precipitated the diverse
ethnic and racial admixture for which the region
has become known. There is also great linguistic
diversity for an area so small in global context.
Spanish, English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and
their “New World” configurations, Papiamentu,
Haitian language, St Lucian kweyol, Jamaican
language, Rasta talk (to list just some of the
indigenous linguistic configurations) mark this part
of the globe as among the obvious choices for
critiques which address cultural diversity.
As a result of what might be seen as a potentially fortuitous future thrown up ironically by
a callous and often brutish past, the Caribbean
has privileged countless hypotheses, theses, speculations, and indeed its fair share of superficial
commentary by providing raw material for conscientious analysis and spurious scholarship
alike. The region’s nominal history of conquest,
exploitation of natural and human resources,
and subjugation by the myopia of eurocentricity
brought Africa, Asia, and Europe together in
this part of the so-called New World. Since this
“meeting of cultures” did not occur in a mutually beneficial context, reflecting epistemological
tolerance and respect, the challenge for the
Caribbean has been to reconstruct itself out of the
tragedy of its inauspicious beginnings. Caribbean
studies as a discipline or perhaps more accurately

Caribbean studies

recent debate about canonical and noncanonical
secular literature rests on such a false analogy,
which Henry Louis Gates, Jr, set out to correct
in his Foreword to the Schomburg Library of
Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers (1988,
p. xviii): “Literary works configure into a tradition
. . . because writers read other writers and ground
their representations of experience in models of
language provided largely by other writers to
whom they feel akin.”
The history of the New Testament canon does
not serve the argument that canons are formed
to exclude diversity. The crucial event that precipitated the formation of the New Testament
was the failed effort of Marcion (c.ad 140) to purge
Christian scripture of its Jewish inheritance (von
Campenhausen, p. 148). Thinking he saw an
irreconcilable antagonism between the Law
and the Gospel and thus between Judaism and
Christianity, Marcion and his followers denounced the non-Pauline epistles and all the
gospels but Luke, which also required careful
editing to remove its Jewish elements. Although
Marcion’s beliefs are known mainly from
Irenaeus’s Contra Haereses, his efforts to produce
a single-voiced testament led to the plurivocivity
of the New Testament, with its four gospels and
interargumentative Pauline and non-Pauline
epistles (see Biblical studies).
In Forms of Attention (1985) and History and
Value (1988), Frank Kermode has argued that
pluralism has sustained the vitality of the literary
canon. He admits, however, that this may be the
“soft view” of canons. The “hard view” would then
be attentive to the politics of interpretation, which
associates canons with networks of institutions
that may be viewed as oppressive (1990, p. 75).
Here the relevant modern institutions seem to be
publishing houses, school and university curricula,
and such professional academic organizations
as the Modern Language Association. Rather
than thinking of canons as fixed or closed lists of
texts, it may be more fruitful to ask, “By what
means do we attribute value to works of art, and
how do our valuations affect our ways of attending to them?” (Kermode, 1985, p. xiii).

as an interdisciplinary endeavor might be defined
as the study and analysis of this region’s coming
into being, its modes of representation, and its
strategies of survival and cultural reproduction.
Such an obviously vast and complex interdisciplinary terrain is beyond the scope of this brief
discussion. As a result, our discussion here will
seek to present a rough sketch of aspects of the
region’s cultural diversity and focus in a general
manner on some of the significant literary
manifestations of Caribbean cultural identity.
Representations of Caribbean Culture might
be said to fall into two camps. There are those who,
like M.G. Smith, argue for cultural pluralism in
the Caribbean (see, for example, Smith’s The
Plural Society in the British West Indies) and
those who argue for creolization or cultural
admixture, like Edward Kamau Braithwaite (see,
for example, Braithwaite’s The Development of
Creole Society in Jamaica: 1770–1820). The former
position sees the Caribbean existing in an uneasy
tension of cultural groupings, held together by
external political and economic forces rather
than by internal cohesiveness. The latter position represents Caribbean cultural reality as an
admixture where, certainly in Braithwaite’s view,
ex-African cultural vestiges underpin Caribbean
cultural diversity. Despite the sometimes radically
different approaches to analyses and representations of Caribbean cultural diversity which still
tend to revolve around these two early positions,
most assessments of Caribbean reality generally
endorse the view expressed by Rex Nettleford:
If the people of the Caribbean own nothing else,
they certainly can own their creative imagination
which, viewed in a particular way, is a powerful
means of production for much that brings
meaning and purpose to human life. And it is the
wide variety of products emanating from the
free and ample exercise of this creative imagination which signifies to man his unique gift of
culture. (Nettleford, 1978)

This creative imagination has been the mainstay
of Caribbean peoples. It has ensured their survival
through centuries of physical atrocities and
material deprivation. With Anansi-like imaginative dexterity, they have wielded this metaphysical
weapon of the weak to create being out of nothingness and personhood out of “otherness.”

Perhaps the material symbol par excellence of
this cultural creativity is the steel pan, a “New
World” musical instrument fashioned from the
discarded oil drum, in the hills of Laventille,
Trinidad. Indeed Laventille itself might be seen
as a symbol of that typically urban, social castaway, the ghetto. Out of these two discards, the
“useless” oil drum and the “useless” ghetto, arises
the steel pan as a twentieth-century reaffirmation
of the indomitable spirit of Caribbean cultural
creativity. This reaffirmation of the spirit of
survival and creativity symbolized by the steel
pan provides Trinidadian novelist Earl Lovelace
with the narrative map for his novel The Wine of
Astonishment. In similar fashion, Bob Marley,
Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer create a haunting
union of lyric and beat out of the “nothingness”
of a Kingston, Jamaica ghetto, yet another
“New World” cultural creation which would see
Marley’s name and music internationalized with
such evangelistic fervor that the signifiers “Bob
Marley” and “Reggae” resonate with the authority of synecdoche across national and linguistic
boundaries to conjure up representations of the
Caribbean. Challenged to construct personhood
in the hostile, ontological wasteland of plantation America, Caribbean peoples have repeatedly
defied historical odds and stereotypical representations of themselves as lack and void. Whether
as Toussaint L’Ouverture, rising out of slavery
to challenge Europe’s greatest generals and create the possibility for Haiti to become the first
black independent state in the so-called New
World, or as Garfield Sobers, rising out of the
obscurity of humble beginnings in diminuitive
Barbados to revolutionize and dominate the
Commonwealth game of cricket, Caribbean
peoples have, for a long time, salvaged their
being from discarded nothingness.
The institutionalized study of Caribbean issues
and affairs is perhaps most obviously embodied
in the region by the University of the West
Indies (UWI), and in the “diaspora” by the
Caribbean Studies Association.
Established in 1948, partly as the colonial
response to an increasingly restless and dissatisfied colonized population, the UWI has
nurtured and been influenced by such figures
as George Beckford, Derek Walcott, Orlando
Patterson, Walter Rodney, Sir Philip Sherlock,
Edward Kamau Braithwaite, Gordon Rohlehr,

111
The traditional “organic intellectuals” of the
region, the calypsonians provide a sense of
the historical and contemporary struggles of
Caribbean peoples through the popular medium
of the calypso. Fine artists such as Edna Manley,
Karl Broodhagen, and Stanley Greaves capture
the traces of the indomitable Caribbean spirit
in stone and on canvas. Rhythm poets like
Mutabaruka, Jean Binta Breeze, Linton Kwesi
Johnson, the late Mikey Smith, Winston Farrell,
and Adisa Andwele capture the historical and
contemporary anguish of Caribbean suffering
and resistance in their poetry. The “mother” of
them all, Louise Bennett-Coverly, smiled at
Caribbean idiosyncrasy and satirized eurocentric
foibles in her “rhythm” poetry long before
either the form or content of such creativity
was deemed serious and respectable. Similarly, Joe
Tudor and Alfred Pragnell were exploring the
artistic merit of oral tradition and folk humor
before such activity was generally recognized
as evidence of cultural and artistic creativity.
In short, the Caribbean has never lacked the
unfathomable resource of the creative and critical imagination, though it has lacked and still lacks
much materially, at least from the perspective
of the mass of ordinary folk comprising most of
its population.
Privileging the power of the creative imagination as a resource is not tantamount to romanticizing the Caribbean. This is the resource
which allowed Caribbean peoples to survive the
material deprivation and psychological trauma
of slavery, indentureship, and colonialism. It is
the resource by which the Caribbean protects
and sustains itself into the twenty-first century,
despite claims to the contrary made by technocracy at the altar of technology. Caribbean studies
is therefore essentially the study of this phenomenon, the Caribbean creative imagination.

Caribbean studies

Rex Nettleford, Kenneth Ramchand, Elsa Goveia,
Sir Frank Worrell, and a host of other intellectual
workers whose steadfast vocation has been the
Caribbean. It is ironically appropriate, given
the Caribbean’s history of creating value out of
the resource of the mind, the creative imagination, that the site of the first of UWI’s three
campuses is located on a former plantation in
Jamaica. A place of material deprivation and
tortured disposession, signified by slavery and
indentureship, transformed into a place where
Caribbean peoples would grapple with a colonial
past and move beyond it to address the complexities of a postcolonial future.
The Caribbean Studies Association (CSA) is
an organization of academics and other intellectual workers who came together in 1975 because
they shared an interest in the study of the
Caribbean. Since the first conference in Puerto
Rico, the group has met annually in places such
as Grenada, Barbados, Martinique, Jamaica, and
other areas of the Caribbean. Another smaller
group devoted to the study of the Caribbean
is the Association of Caribbean Studies. This
group, aware of the importance of regional links
to the diaspora as well as ancestral homelands,
has held conferences in several extraregional
locations including the African continent. At
the Jamaica campus of the UWI there is the
Institute of Caribbean Studies which publishes
a monthly newsletter about books, projects, conferences, and other items and activities related to
Caribbean studies.
In addition to these institutional approaches
to the study of the area, there are of course the
critical contributions of intellectuals who have
worked outside of institutional frameworks
for the most part. The creative and critical work
of C.L.R. James is essential to any conscientious
understanding and critical interpretation of the
history and culture of this region. The fiction
of George Lamming, Jean Rhys, Wilson Harris,
Samuel Selvon, Erna Brodber, and several other
anglophone Caribbean novelists might be considered essential reading in order to gain insight
into the narrative construction of West Indian personhood. Similarly, the work of Alejo Carpentier,
Aimé Césaire, Jacques Roumain and others provides a window into the physical and metaphysical
struggles of embattled personhood from the hispanophone and francophone perspectives.

`Castoriadis, Cornelius (1922–1997)
 French
political/social theorist and psychoanalyst. Though
born in Constantinople and educated in Athens,
Castoriadis lived in France from 1945. He founded
the influential left-wing journal Socialisme ou
Barbarie in 1949. Castoriadis began as a Marxist
theorist interested in the questions of bureaucratic
capitalism. His early contention that management
by workers could serve as a check to Stalinism was
confirmed by the events of the Hungarian
Revolution in 1956. Castoriadis then went on to
conduct a systematic inquiry into the foundations
of Marxism. This resulted in a rejection of the
Marxist shibboleths of materialism and determinism. Castoriadis saw that the deterministic
strain in Marxism was incompatible with Marx’s
own call for the autonomy of revolutionary action.
Castoriadis argued that it was time to choose
between loyalty to a Discourse that had outworn
its usefulness and the need to remain a revolutionary. He advanced instead a conception of the
social-historical. By this he meant the world of
human action that would not be restricted to a
narrow conception of the political. The revolutionary project itself had to be decentered into a
quest for autonomy in which all could participate.
Such a project would have to move away from
traditional teleologies of time that are deterministic. Castoriadis distinguishes between homogeneous and heterogeneous modes of temporality
in capitalism. It is precisely this difference between
the time of consolidation and crisis that distinguishes capitalism from other modes of economic
organization. All societies, however, misrecognize the tension between the different modes of
temporality by which they are constituted. This
is, however, not a matter of “ontological necessity.” The revolutionary agenda is predicated on
the possibility of being able to switch between
modes of temporality.
The permutational possibilities of the socialhistorical depend on the “social imaginary.” The

imaginary is not a mere reflection of some preexistent reality. It is instead the very condition of
possibility for a relation between the object and
the image. The imaginary institutes the moment
of singularity in any sociohistorical formation.
It functions as a minimal coupling of signifier–
signified without which it would not be possible
to articulate the differences between what matters
and what does not in any given epoch. The social
imaginary cannot be reduced to a set of impersonal rules; the belief that it can be reduced to
one is the illusion of theory. There is no such
thing as a “rigorously rigorous theory” even in
mathematics, let alone in politics. Hence the
ethical necessity of admitting responsibility for
any theory that is advanced by the theorist. The
theorist cannot retire to his study and submit
everything to systematic doubt. He/she is always
already constituted through the social. That which
is opposed to the social is not the individual
Subject but the psyche. Castoriadis advances
the notion of a psychical monad. The monad is
torn open only by socialization. But then again
the social imaginary is accessed only through the
psyche. A relation of mutual supplementarity is
posited between the two.
Castoriadis brings a similar claim to bear on
the scientific claims of Psychoanalysis. Neither
psychoanalysis nor political theory can hope to
become a science. These discourses are organized
by fields of transference where the identity of the
author continues to matter. Whereas the rough
notes of a Newton or Einstein do not matter to
the validity of their theories, it would not be
possible to maintain the same claim in the case
of, say, Freud’s correspondence with Wilhelm
Fliess. Referring to Lacan’s comment that he had
“discovered” Freud, Castoriadis writes that scientists discover things and not other scientists.
Dirac did not claim to have discovered Planck but
the positive electron. Psychoanalysis should not
trap itself in the desire to be a science but should
recognize that it cannot be anything more than
a “practicopoetic” activity. Psychoanalysis does
not actualize either the faculties or the potential
of a Subject directly; it seeks instead to actualize “a potential of the second degree, a capacity
of a capacity to be.” Psychoanalysis then, despite
being confronted with the real, must come to
terms with the impossibility of its formalization.
Castoriadis’s critique of Lacan stems precisely

`Cavell, Stanley (1926–) 
Philosopher, born
in Atlanta, Georgia, professor of Aesthetics and
the general theory of value at Harvard University.
His extensive writing is greatly influenced by his
teacher J.L. Austin and by the twentieth-century
philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Hearing
Austin give the William James lectures at Harvard
in 1955 (later published in 1962 as How To Do
Things With Words) caused Cavell to stop work
on his dissertation and to choose a different path
of research and topic for study. (That decision
would delay the completion of his dissertation, The
Claim to Rationality, until 1961.) His reading of
Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations revealed
a philosophy that was novel in its manner of
Writing and grounded in a Kantian and transcendental spirit of inquiry, both of which gave
Cavell’s work a form and direction it was never
to lose. Cavell was one of the earliest to note the
Kantian spirit in Wittgenstein’s work – see his
essays “Must we mean what we say” and “The
availability of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy”

– and to give Austin serious hearing in philosophical contexts; see his “Austin at criticism”
(Cavell, 1969). His writings also include published texts on Shakespeare’s plays and skepticism
(Disowning Knowledge, 1987), on film study and
the kind of object film presents to aesthetic
inquiry (The World Viewed, 1979), and on
Thoreau and Emerson and the need to recover the
sometimes intentionally severed and largely
neglected tradition of American philosophy they
initiated (The Senses of Walden, 1972). Throughout these writings there is often expressed a
desire to recognize the destruction wrought by
dualistic conceptions of ourselves and our relations to others, and similarly to bridge the gap,
to keep conversations open, between AngloAmerican and Continental philosophy.
Cavell’s work is most fully constituted by his
Claim of Reason (1979). It is the one indispensable text for understanding and appreciating
him. All the areas addressed in his writings are
given a place in The Claim of Reason and his many
recurring topics of interest are discussed there, for
example, the denial by philosophy of an essential
part of itself, the need to pursue self-knowledge
(and thereby understand the value and limits
of empirical knowledge), the hope for a facing
of, and finally a living of, skepticism. While these
topics are closely interrelated in Cavell’s work
and give way to numerous other concerns, they
none the less can usefully serve as nodal points
for engaging his writings.
The Nature of Philosophy The discipline (those
who are part of it) must come to recognize the
need to replace pursuits of certainty and empirical groundings of being with attempts at finding
and situating itself (themselves). In our philosophical reflections, we need to embrace our
finitude and ordinary existence rather than flee
from them. It is important to ask what our lives
would be like if we accepted, rather than fought
with, the truth of skepticism, with the fact that
we cannot obtain infallible groundings for our
concerns. Philosophy must try to keep open the
threat of and temptation to skepticism, rather than
give it a less destructive face, and prize the inhuman. To face skepticism is to provide interpretation of human finitude, and for Cavell, following
Emerson, Austin, and Wittgenstein (among
others) means understanding what is at stake in

Cavell, Stanley

from the latter’s attempt to formalize the real. He
reads Lacan’s use of topological objects like the
Moebius strip as an attempt to evacuate history
in the impossible attempt to emulate science.
And again, Castoriadis argues vehemently that the
question of doctrinal transmission cannot be
addressed in a formulaic mode that will not seek
recourse to a natural language. What psychoanalysis, pedagogy, and politics have in common
is the attempt to create autonomous individuals.
Autonomy, for Castoriadis, is a state where the
subject is capable of self-reflexivity and deliberation. Autonomy, however, is not an end in itself
but a means to other possibilities. The politics of
autonomy should transcend modes of being that
are specific to psychoanalysis, pedagogy, and
social consciousness such that the subject continues
to draw its creativity from “the radical imaginary of the anonymous collectivity.”

Cavell, Stanley

114
inhabiting our words and the language we use.
Philosophy’s task is not to defeat skepticism but
to preserve it; to show why it has no end, at least
none within philosophy. Cavell’s call to live our
skepticism is not simply an assertion of our
natural condition as knowers (our nonknowing
relationship to the world and others) but to
encourage a way to inhabit our condition of
doubt and thereby situate our lives. We must
acknowledge the truth of skepticism rather than
avoid or attempt to refute it.
Self-knowledge If we do accept the position on
skepticism and the perspective of philosophy
given by Cavell, then he believes we will see,
and the philosopher in us all will see, the proper
place of self-knowledge for our interests. The
quest for self-knowledge is prevalent in all of
Cavell’s writings and can be found investigated
in each part of The Claim of Reason. Cavell
attempts to uncover the motivations and reasons
for traditional philosophy’s (mainly the modern
period’s) rejection of the human and pursuit of
self-knowledge. Philosophy, as Cavell tries to
understand it, must push beyond saying that
something is true or false, trying to grasp the argument, problem, or conclusion someone utters or
writes. It must consider the finite human being
who says what is true or false. Instead of confronting our everyday selves and work, Cavell
finds that we substitute for it, exchange for it, the
search for empirical knowledge (regardless of
whether we believe in the final success of such
knowledge). By placing self-knowledge in the
forefront of the philosophical inquiry Cavell is not
encouraging self-indulgence or a rejection of
an objective (non-personal) perspective. One of
the important themes of The Claim of Reason is
that pursuit of the self reveals the other. It is not
a narcissistic enterprise we engage in when seeking self-knowledge. The soul is impersonal and no
matter how far we go in the investigations of the
self we do not find anything special to us.
Skepticism Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations, says Cavell, is endlessly struggling with
skepti-cism. Cavell’s own struggle with Wittgenstein’s text, as well as with the nature of
philosophy and concerns with self-knowledge,
lead him to conclude that we must finally see
skepticisim as a part of what it is to be human.

It is that part of our being which desires and
obsessively demands a relationship of knowing to
the world and others, yet is unable to succeed
in achieving such knowledge. (This is Cavell’s
retelling of the peculiar fate of reason expressed
by Kant in the opening sentence of Critique of Pure
Reason.) We must not then try to refute skepticism or overcome it but learn to face it and live
it, accept the fact of our intellectual, moral and
ordinary finitude and limits. To live my skepticism, to face the truth of skepticism, is to recover
the self and find my ordinary, human voice.
As these three topics indicate, Cavell offers
definite challenges to such areas as analytical
philosophy, deconstructive literary theory, epistemological foundationalism. While many have
avoided reading and confronting Cavell and rest
undisturbed at philosophy and intellectual
studies forgoing their therapeutic, self-directed
dimension, others find Cavell compelling yet
cannot accept his seemingly overwrought way of
writing and apparent abandoning of traditional
philosophical argumentation. Cavell’s writing is
at times admittedly difficult and his attention to
argument is to be sure not always the traditional
one. Nevertheless, his writing is a far cry from
argument abandonment. His way of writing
encourages us to understand argument as one way
of accepting full responsibilty for one’s own
discourse, confessing reasons why one uses the
words one does and in the manner one does.
His manner (call it his method) of writing and
the context of that writing exhibit an attempt at
reattaching our philosophical attention to what
we say and mean.
Certainly many forms of philosophical
investigation invite the perspectives provided in
Cavell’s work (most of which Cavell cites and
draws from at length), but seldom to the ends
or with the consistency found in Cavell. He
attempts to show us that our words often do not
mean what we say, that we easily lose control of
them. Our loss of control is not over what words
mean but what we mean in using them when and
where we do. We easily lose a sense of ourselves
and the context of language use in which we
speak. (Cavell finds these concerns dominating that
lost philosophical tradition in America voiced by
Thoreau and Emerson; he sees them underwriting
the concerns of ordinary language philosophy,
as it is found in Wittgenstein and Austin, and

`Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies
A postgraduate unit of the University of
Birmingham, important in the later development
of Cultural studies. The CCCS, founded in
1964 within an English Department by Richard
Hoggart (subsequent Directors were Stuart
Hall and Richard Johnson) instigated an energetic cross-disciplinary exploration of areas within
media, youth culture, education, gender, and
“race.” It became widely known for its combination of engaged political critique (concerned with
Ideology, Hegemony, and struggles over meanings in everyday life), work on texts but also
through ethnographic studies inside a framework
of political and social change, and a restless
exploration of theoretical frameworks. A practice
of group work and writing by staff and student
members (many of whom taught and published
elsewhere, so helping to register cultural studies as
a space within education), resulted in a series of
working papers, a journal, and various influential
books. CCCS later (1988) became a Department of
Cultural Studies (within Social Sciences), developing undergraduate as well as higher degrees and
producing its own journal and books.

`Chicago school
 An influential body of sociological writing from the University of Chicago
between the wars. The rapid growth and extreme
diversity of Chicago combined with a concern
for social reform to provide a common focus for
diverse writers. Robert Park and others pioneered
approaches to the study of contrasting City areas,
using detailed ethnographies and life-history work
to examine informal networks and shared values
among even apparently “unattached” groups.
Elements of future concerns with symbolic interaction, the sociology of deviance, and Subcultures were strongly present. Despite later criticism
of the use of ecological metaphors for urban form,
and close attention to subordinate groups which
neglected Structures of power and the worlds
of the powerful, the early Chicago work and that
of succeeding generations have produced debate
and empirical analysis important in sociology
and in urban studies.

`children’s literature
 Books written for children
readers and listeners with the intent to provide
one or more of the following: moral or social
instruction; amusement; imagination and curiosity; compassion and empathy; an understanding of the child’s place in the world. Children’s
stories reveal much of what the individual and
therefore society becomes. Each cultural group
will teach their children that which they deem
important and stories are very much a part of that
process.
A thorough understanding of cultural and
critical theory cannot be fully achieved without
the inclusion and careful examination of children’s
literature. The discipline of cultural anthropology aims to understand and define why people
behave differently from one group to another.
Cultural anthropologists assert that all people
have the ability to classify experiences, convert
those experiences symbolically into language,
art, literature, and other forms of representation,
and teach these abstractions to others. Part of that
teaching is through oral or written stories for
youth. Since critical theory examines and critiques society and literature, children’s literature
affords the first portal to the understanding of any
given society and is a logical starting point for all
further discourse. What is ultimately discovered
is that an analysis of children’s literature demonstrates human commonality more than that
which separates us.
Adult attitudes have always influenced a child’s
upbringing and so, too, children’s stories. Some
of the earliest evidence we have of recorded children’s literature are surviving clay tablets excavated
in Sumeria from the Third Ur Dynasty (2112–
1000 bc). The tablets fall into five categories:
dialogues and debates; exercises for writing
practice; lullabies; stories of schoolboys’ lives;
proverbs and fables. Throughout known history,

at a very young age children are taught societal
rules, moral principals, and more through stories,
legends, folklore, Fairy tales, and songs. This
exchange lays the groundwork for the child to
understand the customs of their culture, what is
expected of them, what is good and evil, and
ultimately to help the child to understand who they
are and how they fit into their society.
Children’s stories are also meant to entertain
and enchant, both for amusement, to foster
imagination, and to assist the child by providing hints for dealing with life’s trials. Bruno
Bettelheim’s The Uses of Enchantment: The
Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales provides
an excellent summary point on this.
Myths and fairy stories both answer the eternal
questions: What is the world really like? How am
I to live my life in it? How can I truly be myself ?
The answers given by myths are definite, while
the fairy tale is suggestive; its messages may
imply solutions, but it never spells them out. Fairy
tales leave to the child’s fantasizing whether and
how to apply to himself what the story reveals
about life and human nature. (Bettelheim, 1986,
p. 45)

This purposefulness in children’s stories isn’t
accidental. Whether it is a printed story that
children want to read time and time again, or
an oral account or song that is repeated by the
adult with the intent to make certain the child
remembers the messages they want to convey,
children’s stories are, to a great part, a transference of societal rules, philosophies, and cultural
tools that will help guide the child throughout her
life cycle.
Children’s stories are also meant to comfort,
for childhood and life itself is fraught with fearful experiences. The goal is to gradually transform
the child into a responsible adult who will play a
role in the prosperity of the community. Despite
the enormous diversity of cultures in the world,
there are common ties that link us all together and
these ties are readily addressed in many current
works of children’s literature and in the fairy tales
and myths that have been with us for centuries.
Perhaps the most important and enduring
components to powerful children’s stories are
those that fire the child’s imagination. Through
carefully chosen words the author paints a vivid
picture of characters, places, and situations that

With Mr. Grummage leading the way I stepped
finally, hesitantly, upon the deck of the Seahawk.
A man was waiting for us. He was a small man
– most seafaring men are small – barely taller than
I and dressed in a frayed green jacket over a white
shirt that was none too clean. His complexion was
weathered dark, his chin ill-shaven. His mouth
was unsmiling. His fingers fidgeted and his feet
shuffled. His darting, unfocused eyes, set deep in
a narrow ferret-like face, gave the impression of
one who is constantly on watch for threats that
might appear from any quarter at any moment.
(Avi, 1990, p. 16)

Children’s literature creates indelible images that
stay with the child throughout their life. Some
children’s stories are intentionally specific to the
child’s culture and/or religion, promoting that
which the adult and their group affiliation wish
the child to learn. The more powerfully memorable and profoundly influencing stories are
those that address what humans have always
struggled with, regardless of where or when they
lived: the struggle between good and evil, the
dread of loneliness, fear of abandonment and
fear of the unknown, being faced with challenges

meant for an adult, and ultimately the need to feel
hope. Whether they are modern stories or those
that have continued to be passed down through
generations and across cultures, common themes
abound, combined with excellent writing to ensure
the story’s survival. Throughout the longevity of
a tale, economics, politics, religion, and whatever
adaptations are needed to best capture the attention of the child audience will inevitably take
place, yet despite this, the core underpinnings of
the story remain the same.
One such model that has always been extremely
successful in literature for young and old alike
is the journey. Tales of heroic adventures have
always been an integral part of all world cultures.
Stories from around the world and from many
periods of history contain common themes and
thought-provoking principals. Throughout the
ages, the same typical sequence is seen: the hero
or heroine must go on a journey, often unwillingly.
The journey is fraught with danger, trials, and
illuminating revelations, thus transforming the
hero or heroine’s consciousness. Assisted along
the way by helpers, she or he returns from the journey with the treasure – a physical treasure, the
treasure of wisdom, or both. Joseph Campbell
asserts that myths address the same concerns
today as they did in ancient times, further
affirming that humans are, at our core, more
similar than different.
A current and wildly popular example of
this sequence can be seen in J.K. Rowling’s
“Harry Potter” series. Incredibly rich descriptions of characters, places, and events energize
the imagination of the reader/listener as they are
immersed in the adventures and trials of Harry.
As he struggles against unthinkable evil to right
the wrong of the world, this hero always returns
(albeit by the skin of his teeth) from his journey
with the treasure of enhanced wisdom, and that
wisdom (for Harry and readers/listeners) is paralleled with an important lesson – the inevitability
of further life challenges to come. There are other
messages in the “Harry Potter” books that offer
deeper meaning to the timelessness and similarities of humanity, past and present. Muggles represent dullards who plod through life unaware of
magic or joy, and there are two types of wizards:
wizards, like Harry, who understand their gifts
and use their magic primarily to do good while
sometimes tempted to do otherwise; and the

children’s literature

the child then creates in their mind. Long before
the written word and, therefore, illustrated books,
storytellers captured their audience with their
lively recitations. The same is true today. If the
story and the storyteller provide an engaging
presentation both orally and in body language,
illustrations aren’t necessary to captivate the
audience. Through rich, full-bodied writing and
distinct descriptions, listeners and readers are
immediately drawn into the story and become part
of it. It is imperative, though, that the child be
able to connect with the story by way of an
underlying identifiable conflict. Such is the case
in Avi’s The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle
– a flawless novel for older readers/listeners that
evokes sensual and powerful sights, sounds, and
smells that describe a terrifying, perilous journey
in 1832 for the young thirteen-year-old heroine,
Charlotte, who is alone on a sailing vessel of
mutinous, hardened seafaring men who resent
her place among them. In describing her first
impressions upon boarding the sailing vessel
that would take her across the Atlantic, readers
immediately sense and identify with her primal
conflict – fear.

children’s literature

wizards that have gone to the dark side, wielding
their magic to wreak havoc and evil at any cost.
The themes of good versus evil are hardly new
in literature or in life; the reality of this conflict
is as old as the dawn of humans. Fairy tales are
prime examples of such stories, and their timeless appeal is understandable: fairy tales permit
the child to come to terms with the problem in
a simplified, optimistic way.
It is characteristic of fairy tales to state an
existential dilemma briefly and pointedly. This
permits the child to come to grips with the
problem in its most essential form, where a
more complex plot would confuse matters for
him. The fairy tale simplifies all situations. Its
figures are clearly drawn . . .
All characters are typical rather than unique.
Contrary to what takes place in many
modern children’s stories, in fairy tales evil is as
omnipresent as virtue. In practically every fairy
tale good and evil are given body in the form of
some figures and their actions, as good and evil
are omnipresent in life and the propensities for
both are present in every man. It is this duality
which poses the moral problem, and requires the
struggle to solve it. (Bettelheim, 1986, pp. 8–9)

The struggles and difficult obstacles of life are
often unavoidable, and our “dark” side is always
with us, like it or not. Today, many modern
children’s stories fail to properly address good
versus evil. Instead, these stories are sanitized,
brimming with optimism, and make little or no
mention of the conflicts with evil and the dark
side. The result is a weak story that teaches little
and in all likelihood will not survive past its
first printing. On the other hand, fairy tales
and other excellent children’s literature address
these issues where the evildoer meets their just
desserts, and the young, afraid, and unprepared
child is virtuous in overcoming his trials. In
some cases, though, the hero succumbs to his own
dark side and may even couple with other foes
in the story until he or she grows enough to
recognize the errors that have been made. That
is precisely what is evident in The Adventures of
Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. Written in 1881, this
famous and beloved work has spawned countless
versions around the globe, and for good reason.
The impish and naughty Pinocchio spends the
vast majority of the story getting into trouble,

disobeying his father, and otherwise making
one foolish mistake after another. Time and
time again his father forgives him until at last
Pinocchio’s lies and poor decisions separate
father and son for a very long time. Despite all
of Pinocchio’s obstacles, he is at last reunited
with his father in the belly of an enormous
shark.
Seeing the old man, Pinocchio was filled with such
great and unexpected joy that he became almost
delirious. He wanted to laugh, to cry, and to say
a thousand things, but he could only stammer
out a few confused and broken words. Finally he
succeeded in uttering a cry of joy and, throwing
his arms around the little old man’s neck, began
to shout, “Oh, my dear father! I’ve found you at
last! I’ll never leave you again – never, never,
never!”
“Do my eyes tell me the truth?” said the little
old man, rubbing his eyes. “Are you really my
dear Pinocchio?”
“Yes, yes, I am Pinocchio, really Pinocchio! And
you have forgiven me, have you not? Oh, my dear
father, how good you are! To think that I . . . Oh!
But if you only knew what misfortunes have
been poured upon my head, and all that has
befallen me! Only imagine, the day that you,
dear Father, sold your coat to buy me a spelling
book so that I might go to school, I went to see
the puppet show, and the Showman wanted to
throw me on his fire so that I might roast his
mutton. And he was the same man who later gave
me five gold pieces to take to you, but I met the
fox and the cat, who took me to the Lobster Inn,
where they ate like wolves. And I left by myself
in the middle of the night and encountered
assassins . . . and I ran away . . . until they hung
me from the branch of a tree called the Big Oak
. . . And then I told a lie, and my nose began to
grow until I could no longer get through the door
of the room.” (Collodi, 2005, pp. 177–8)

At long last, Pinocchio has a change of heart, and
he amends his ways. In so doing, he finds that his
goodness has transformed him from a wooden
puppet into a real boy, but this confuses
Pinocchio and he asks his father if the change could
be explained.
“This sudden change is all your doing,”
answered Geppetto.

119

A parent’s desire for their child to be good
couldn’t be more universal. It is also universally
true that children need to know that they are loved
by their parents, but unfortunately, this is not
always the case. When a child is not loved, is
treated unfairly or with cruelty, or the child
perceives being treated unfairly, intense loneliness
and a deep sense of abandonment can ensue. The
child, however, may not be emotionally equipped
to express these feelings in words. Children’s
literature can often offer the voice that the child
needs by identifying with the characters in the
stories and their pitiful situations. This is clearly
seen in numerous stories, some quite old, such
as Hansel and Gretel and Cinderella, others
more current, such as The Secret Garden, The
Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, The Crow
Girl: The Children of Crow Cove, and Sheep. In
these stories and the many more like them, the
child who feels troubled by their circumstances
will readily connect with the story as it validates
and affirms what the child is feeling and ultimately
assures the child that she is not alone.
When a story corresponds to how the child feels
deep down – as no realistic narrative is likely to
do – it attains an emotional quality of “truth” for
the child. The events of “Cinderella” offer him
vivid images that give body to his overwhelming
but nevertheless often vague and nondescript
emotions; so these episodes seem more convincing to him than his life experiences.
(Bettelheim, 1986, p. 237)

Ultimately, excellent children’s literature
accomplishes much for the child on a variety of
important levels. As the child struggles to understand life and their place in it, children’s stories
offer new windows to cultivate the development
of imagination, thus firing further curiosity and
assisting the child to make sense of his world and
extract meaning out of his existence by employing his powers of imagination that allow him
to formulate possibilities. Of equal importance,
children’s literature fosters the imagination
and, thus, empathetic behaviors. Imagination is

fundamental to a child’s morality: the ability to
imagine alternatives and consequences; free
choice to envision what is going to happen. The
literary category of imagination enables the
reader/listener to imagine the characters and
their situations, trials, joys, and struggles, and in
so doing develop the ability to empathize.
Humans are far more alike than what separates
them in cultural nuances, and there is no better
place to observe those similarities than in children’s
literature. We are universally alike; in the details,
we are different. Humans have always struggled
with good versus evil, our fears are essentially the
same, we all desire joy, to love, and be loved in
return. Children’s literature addresses these
common human traits and provides a place to
dream and imagine. And imagination is essential
to human survival. Lewis Carroll knew that well
and makes a delightful case for just that in Alice’s
Adventures in Wonderland:
“There is no use trying,” said Alice; “one can’t
believe impossible things.”
“I dare say you haven’t had much practice,”
said the Queen. “When I was your age I always
did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes,
I’ve believed as many as six impossible things
before breakfast.”

adaptation and socialization to adult norms.
Long ignored by advocates of cultural and critical theory, as well as by emancipatory, liberal
intellectuals who have championed the needs
of women, the poor, and members of racial and
ethnic minorities, children – despite their obvious
powerlessness and vulnerability – were largely
invisible in the work of cultural and critical
theorists until the launching of an interdisciplinary program at Brooklyn College of The City
University of New York in 1991 in the wake of
the United Nations Convention on the Rights
of the Child in 1989. (Subsequently that convention has been signed by 194 nation-states,
but not by the United States and Somalia.) In her
manifesto for children’s studies, Gertrud Lenzer,
who directs the Children’s Studies Center at
Brooklyn College, outlines the two principal
reasons for launching this new interdisciplinary
field: “First, most disciplines in the arts, humanities, social and medical sciences as well as
law – with the notable exceptions of children’s
literature, child psychology, and pediatrics – had
failed to provide a special focus on children.
In brief, most disciplines did not regard children
as both a separate social class and human transhistorical condition. Childhood was conceived
as a transitory stage on the way toward future
adulthood” (Lenzer, 2001, p. 181). And, second,
“We felt that it was incumbent upon us to
develop a holistic conceptualization of children
as individuals and as a class, in order to overcome
the disciplinary fragmentation of the study of
children into an incoherent manifold of specialized perspectives and to develop a commensurate
and genuinely comprehensive perspective on the
analysis of children” (Lenzer, 2001, pp. 182–3).
She concludes by simply stating the aim of children’s studies: “It makes the ontological claim
that children must be viewed in their fullness as
human beings.” This aim is complementary to
the critical pedagogy of Henry Giroux and
Adam Phillips’s work in child psychoanalysis.
Interdisciplinary children’s studies programs and
centers have recently been started at Rutgers,
Harvard, and Bucknell.

`Chinese studies 
To serve the scope and
purpose of this dictionary, this entry focuses on
the study of contemporary Chinese culture during the past two decades. Active contributors to
this broad topic include international scholars,
scholars in overseas Chinese-language speaking
areas including Taiwan and pre-1997 Hong
Kong, as well as those in mainland China. The last
group is probably the least known in the West,
and therefore contemporary Chinese cultural
studies in mainland China forms the main body
of this entry.
According to Ning Wang, Director of the
Center for Comparative Literature and Cultural
Studies at Tsinghua University,
the range and content of Cultural Studies in
China are similar to those in the West. It covers
at least four areas: ethnic studies, including
studies of postcolonial, minority, and diasporic
writing; area studies, including Asian and
Pacific studies; gender studies, including studies
of feminist, gay, and lesbian writings; and media
studies comprising film, TV, and even internet
studies. (Wang, Ning, 2003, p. 189)

In many ways, contemporary Chinese studies
have been intricately related to Western cultural
and critical theory. The Chinese translation of
Frederic Jameson’s Postmodernism and Cultural
Theories, published in 1986, marked the arrival
of Western cultural and critical theory in the
People’s Republic of China. During the past two
decades, these theories have been serving as “the
main discourse resources” (Tao and Yuanpu,
2005, p. 4) for contemporary Chinese studies,
which has developed around three major themes:
(1) the introduction of Western theories through
translations and initial communications with
Western scholars; (2) the application of Western
theories in Chinese studies; and (3) reflections on
the applicability of Western theories in Chinese
studies, with consideration given to the unique
context of cultural studies in China.
Following the publication of the Chinese version of Postmodernism and Cultural Theories, the
Chinese translation of The Dialectic of Enlightenment by Theodor W. Adorno and Max
Horkheimer was published in 1990. These two
publications were the prelude for a series of
translations of the most influential theoretical

121
Jameson gave lectures that were a milestone and
inspired a new generation of young Chinese
scholars. The 1995 International Conference on
“Cultural Studies: China and the West” in
Dalian was the first conference dedicated to
cultural studies in China. Participants included
internationally acknowledged scholars Terry
Eagleton, Ralph Cohen, and Jonathan Arac,
overseas Chinese scholars Henry Y. H. Zhao,
Kang Liu, Sheldon Lu, and Shaobo Xie, as well
as mainland Chinese scholars Ning Wang, Ersu
Ding, and others. An outcome of this conference
was the 1997 special issue of New Literary History,
which contained nine essays presented at the
conference and two commentaries. Two among
the nine essays were contributed by mainland
Chinese scholars: “Philosophical Discourse of
Postmodernity in the Chinese Context” by Ersu
Ding and “Orientalism versus Occidentalism?”
by Ning Wang. Aware of the indifference to
postmodernism in contemporary Chinese philosophy, Ersu Ding discusses the significance of
postmodernism via the presentation of the postmodernist debate regarding cognitive criteria.
From the perspective of cultural criticism, Ning
Wang’s essay questions Said’s Orientalism theory,
analyzes Occidentalism and its manifestations,
and advocates for cultural dialogue instead of
cultural opposition.
With tremendous enthusiasm, Chinese scholars
and critics not only embraced Western cultural
and critical theory but also immediately applied
them in the study of contemporary Chinese culture. Starting from the early 1990s, publications
of cultural criticism in Chinese have appeared in
the form of journal articles, specialized books, and
anthologies. Scholars with active publications
in this field include Gang Chen, Xiaoming
Chen, Yongguo Chen, Zhiguang Cui, Jinhua
Dai, Bingzhong Gao, Huilin Huang, Yuanpu Jin,

In 1995, Jinhua Dai established China’s first
Cultural Studies Program at Beijing University; this
program is dedicated to film studies and popular
cultural studies. Three journals also played a
significant role in the development of Chinese
Studies. Dushu (Reading), under the co-editorship

Chinese studies

and critical works from the West. The Zhishifenzi
tushuguan (Library of the Intellectuals) series
started in the 1990s. This series consists of
translations of nearly thirty works by Fredric
Jameson, Harold Bloom, Jonathan Culler,
Stanley Fish, Paul De Man, Terry Eagleton,
Walter Benjamin, Edward William Said, and
others; one of the latest books in this series is
the translation of Perry Anderson’s A Zone of
Engagement, published in July 2008. With the
advent of the twenty-first century, more translation series were published. Wenhua he chuanbo
yicong (Translation Series of Culture and Communications) introduced a dozen works related
to media studies, with authors including Marshall
McLuhan, Stuart Hall, and John Fiske. Another,
with more than twenty translations, all related to
modernism and postmodernism, was contributed
by Xiandaixing yanjiu yicong (Translation Series
of Modernity Studies). Authors in this series
include David Harvey, Raymond Williams, Jean
Baudrillard, Matei Cflinescu, and Richard
Wolin, among others. In the field of popular
cultural studies, Dazhong wenhua yanjiu yicong
(Translation Series of Popular Cultural Studies)
has published five translations of works by Laura
Stempel Mumford, Angela McRobbie, John Fiske,
Jennifer Craik, Andrew Goodwin, Garry Whannel,
and others. Dangdai xueshu lengjing yicong
(Translation Series of Contemporary Academic
Prism) consists of a number of sub-series with
different foci, including popular cultural studies,
global cultural studies, philosophy, sociology,
overseas Marxism and post-Marxism, media
studies, and linguistics; this series has contributed
nearly fifty translations. Since 1986, over a hundred translations of Western cultural and critical
theory works have been published in Chinese.
In addition to the growing familiarity with
Western cultural and critical theory through
translations, Chinese scholars have initiated
communication with Western theorists and
critics via lectures and conferences. Among the
initial face-to-face contacts, Fredrik Jameson’s
visit to Beijing University in 1985, as well as
the 1995 International Conference on “Cultural
Studies: China and the West,” deserve special
attention. During September through December
in 1985, Fredrik Jameson systematically introduced postmodernist theory to Beijing University;
as the first Western visiting scholar in this field,

Chinese studies

of Hui Wang and Ping Huang since 1996,
published a series of cultural critiques giving
close attention to contemporary social-political
issues, including housing allocation system reform,
governmental structure reform, census reform,
medical system reform, the wave of immigration
to cities, rural construction, educational system
reform, and so on. Shijie (Horizons) and Wenhua
yanjiu (Cultural Studies), founded at the beginning
of the twenty-first century, both place equal importance on the introduction of leading-edge
Western theories and the presentation of domestic scholarship. Issues of Shijie, under the coeditorship of Tuo Li and Yangu Chen, consist of
eight sections including “theoretical frontiers,”
“international scholars,” “free talk,” “cultural
studies,” “dialogue and interview,” “the critic,” “the
art studio,” and “book review.” Wenhua yanjiu,
under the group editorship of Dongfeng Tao,
Yuanpu Jin, and Bingzhong Gao, covers all major
topics related to contemporary Chinese studies,
among which are “visual cultural studies,” “literature and culture,” “culture and power,” and so
on; scholarship in Wenhua yanjiu covers both
theoretical explorations and case studies.
Among this broad range of topics, the study of
popular culture, as well as postcolonial criticism
versus China’s modernity, has aroused the most
interest and provoked the most significant
debates to date. Two books, Wenhua yanjiu:
Xifang yu zhongguo (Cultural Studies: The West and
China) by Dongfeng Tao and Dangdai zhongguo
de wenhua piping (Cultural Criticism in Contemporary China) by Dongfeng Tao and Yanrui
Xu, provide the most comprehensive introduction
of studies in these two fields.
The study of popular culture, or, in the term
generally used in Chinese-language scholarship,
mass culture, has developed from the application
of and reflections on the culture industry theory
of the Frankfurt school, particularly as defined
and analyzed in The Dialectic of Enlightenment. For
example, Hong Yin argued that, according to its
functions, mass culture in contemporary China
is an entertaining culture; according to its productive method, it is a good manufactured by
the culture industry; according to its text, it is
a two-dimensional culture; and according to its
circulation method, it is a pan-citizen culture
deprived of class differences. As a form of culture,

its political, enlightening, educational, and even
aesthetic functions are suppressed, yet the
sensational, playful, and entertaining functions
are strengthened and emphasized. Yin did not
repudiate the contributions of mass culture to the
balance and adjustments of not only individual
psychological development but also social
structure. He did, however, provide a systematic
criticism of mass culture from three major perspectives: (1) what mass culture provides is a
false satisfaction that leaves the subjects in a state
of performative joy, forgetting the basic meaning
of existence; (2) the unrealistic nature of mass
culture often distorts people’s understanding of
the real world, thus weakening their judgment; and
(3) the reproductive manufacturing method of
mass culture leads to the loss of individuality, creativity, passion for criticism, as well as realistic
spirit, which ultimately leads to an abandonment of humanistic spirit (Tao and Xu, 2006,
pp. 78–9).
Reflections on the applicability of the cultural
industry theory to the study of contemporary
Chinese mass culture were, at least partially, a
response to the above criticism. Dongfeng Tao
pointed out three gaps in the application of the
Frankfurt school theory in this study: (1) it does
not grant sufficient consideration of the specific
social-historical context for the emergence of
Chinese mass culture during the 1980s directly after
the totalitarian period, which started as early as
the 1950s and encompassed, in particular, the
Cultural Revolution (1966–76); (2) essentially,
it applies the criteria for elite culture to mass
culture; and (3) it focuses on abstract moral criticism and aesthetic criticism yet does not analyze
the special political functions of Chinese mass
culture in its unique and specific social and historical context (Tao and Xu, 2006, p. 79). Tao,
an important voice in this particular area, criticized the mechanical application of the critical
theory of the Frankfurt school to the study of
Chinese mass culture. With special attention to
the historical transition of Chinese society during the 1980s as the specific social and historical
context of the emergence of Chinese mass culture,
Tao argued that the primary criterion for the
criticism of Chinese mass culture was whether or
not it performed the political function of resisting totalitarianism and promoting democracy

123
the beginning of 1994. Dongfeng Tao analyzed
the interrelation between the popularity of
Orientalism in China and nationalism in the
context of cultural conservatism and the renaissance theory of Eastern culture, as well as the new
global political structure. Later in the same year,
Longxi Zhang pointed out the dangers of idealizing and romanticizing non-Western civilizations while criticizing Western civilization and
advocating for cultural pluralism. In particular,
he criticized the methodology of, on the one
hand, condemning nineteenth-century Western
colonial culture, and, on the other hand, applying Western theory, for example, postcolonial
theory (see Postcolonial studies), as a criterion
for issues specific to the East (Tao and Xu, 2006,
pp. 134–5).
Almost simultaneously with the above debate,
the issue of knowledge mode in China became the
focus of discussion; this was intricately related
to specific reflections on the development of
China’s culture and society since the May Fourth
Movement in 1919. In an article published in
Wenyi zhengming (Literary and Cultural Debates)
in 1994, Fa Zhang, Yiwu Zhang, and Yichuan
Wang pointed out that, starting from as early as
1840, “modernity” had been the basic mode of
knowledge in China, and it had manifested in
the domination of Western modernity. Chinese
modernization was analyzed as a process through
which Chinese national identity was abandoned.
This discussion saw the 1990s as the beginning
of a new mode of knowledge: a “Chineseness,”
which inherited the values of both classical tradition and Western modernity with an emphasis
on and acceptance of cultural differences and
developmental diversity (Tao and Xu, 2006,
pp. 135–7). In a later issue of the same year,
Jian Shao voiced counter-arguments, focusing
on criticizing the methodology of explaining
Chinese modernity through postmodernism and
postcolonialism theory. Shao opposed the
assumptions of the above theory, in particular
identifying modernization with Westernization.
He also opposed the juxtaposition of “modernity”
and “Chineseness,” analyzing “modernity” as a
chronological concept in the development of
human societies instead of a geographical concept
in the context of global economy/politics. Based
on this discussion, Shao declared that China was

Chinese studies

(Tao and Xu, 2006, pp. 82–4). Advocates of this
approach argued against the polarization of
popular and humanistic thought. They pointed out
that the opposition of humanistic thought was not
the popular thought embodied in mass culture;
instead, it was the planned economy and the
totalitarian ideology of China before the 1980s.
With this understanding, Chinese mass culture
was seen in a positive light, as part of the consequences of market economy and as the
reflection of changes in material reality on the
spiritual life (Tao and Xu, 2006, p. 84).
Another important approach to contemporary Chinese mass culture was proposed through
political-economic analysis and class analysis,
techniques that appeared towards the end of the
1990s. This approach defined contemporary
Chinese mass culture as the culture of middle-class
privilege. Jinhua Dai argued that, during the
1990s, mass culture and mass media identified
themselves with the taste and consuming habits
of the extremely prosperous middle class. In
essence, this mass culture was middle-class culture and derived from capitalism and capitalist
ideology. And not only did this mass culture
conceal the reality of rapid class polarization
in the new era, it also legitimized the profit and
power of the middle class (Tao and Xu, 2006,
pp. 98 –100).
Compared to the study of contemporary
Chinese mass culture with its three major
approaches, the field of postcolonial criticism
versus China’s modernity is even more complex,
marked by a series of debates. The first major
debate focused on the extensions of Orientalism
as defined by Said. In 1993, a series of articles
published in Dushu reflected on Western
modernization as well as the nature of China’s
modernization. Within the framework of postcolonial discourse, Kuan Zhang called for special
attention to issues including the infiltration of
colonial elements in Western humanities, interactions among Western modern social science,
humanities, and colonization, the approach of
Third World intellectuals to the fact of being
colonized and/or semi-colonized, as well as
strategies of freeing themselves from the Westdominated colonial discourse (Tao and Xu,
2006, pp. 132–4). Active responses to these
articles were published in the same journal at

Chodorow, Nancy

124
undergoing the transformation from a pre-modern
to a modern era, instead of transforming from a
modern to a postmodern era (Tao and Xu, 2006,
pp. 139–41).
The focus of other debates included the
Chinese national character, Yimou Zhang’s films
of the 1980s and the 1990s, literature by Chinese
overseas students and scholars, and many other
issues. Each debate resonated with a number of
scholars, inspiring responses containing penetrating reflections on Chinese life. Major thoughts
during these periods are also analyzed in Hui
Wang’s “Contemporary Chinese Thought and
the Question of Modernity” (in Wang, Hui,
2003). The conclusion of this article provides the
following vision for studies in this field.
Even though there is no one theory that can
explain the complex and often mutually contradictory problems that we now face, it nevertheless behooves Chinese intellectuals to break
their dependence on time-honored binary
paradigms, such as China/West and tradition/
modernity, to pay more attention to the factors
that might contribute to institutional innovation within society, to attend to the capacity
for renewal within civil society, and to move on
to a reexamination of the historical methods
and conditions under which China has sought
modernity. The reconsideration of China’s
problems by placing them in the context of
globalization is an urgent theoretical problem.
Socialist historical practice is part of the past; the
future designs of global capitalism, by the same
token, do not promise to overcome the crisis of
modernity that Weber wrote about. The modern
era, as a historical phase, continues. This provides
the impetus for the continued existence and
development of critical thought; it may prove for
Chinese intellectuals to be a historic opportunity
for theoretical and institutional innovation.
(Wang, Hui, 2003, pp. 186–7)

It is also important to note that the new century witnessed the establishment of institutions
focusing specifically on cultural studies. In 2001,
the Center for Comparative Literature and
Cultural Studies was established in Tsinghua
University, and the Center for Chinese Contemporary Cultural Studies in Shanghai University. In
2004, the Cultural Studies Program was founded
in Shanghai University; this is a graduate program

aiming at nurturing scholarship specializing in
contemporary Chinese studies.

`Chodorow, Nancy (1944–)
 US feminist
sociologist and psychoanalytic critic. The central
project of Chodorow’s most influential work,
The Reproduction of Mothering (1978), was to
explain the seemingly inevitable, trans-historical,
and cross-culturally universal fact of male dominance in terms that did not assume biological
determinism, but would instead allow intervention and transformation of the sexual divisions of
productive and reproductive labor. Published at
a time when most US feminists were hostile to
Psychoanalysis, The Reproduction of Mothering
made a strong case for its usefulness to feminist
inquiry. Drawing on the work of Karen Horney
and Melanie Klein, Chodorow revised traditional
theories of Object-Relations and Freudian
narratives of development, shifting the focus
from the father and the Oedipal complex to the
mother and the pre-Oedipal period to conclude
that Gender identity is constructed differently for
men and women: “women’s self more in relation
and involved with boundary negotiations, separation and connection, men’s self more distanced and based on defensively firm boundaries
and denials of self-other connection” (1989, p. 2).
Women’s exclusive responsibility for childrearing
is a prime determinant of male dominance, for
women who mother (and men who do not) produce daughters “with mothering capacities and the

`Chomsky, Noam (1928–)
 American linguist
and political campaigner. Born in Philadelphia
in the eastern United States, Chomsky first studied linguistics under Zellig Harris (see Harris,
Zellig) at the University of Pennsylvania. After
a short spell at Harvard he moved to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in
Boston in 1955, where he has been based ever
since. In the mid-1960s he actively opposed
United States military involvement in Vietnam and
was arrested while addressing a large anti-war
demonstration in Washington. Subsequently he
has been equally critical of United States policy
around the world, particularly the Pacific region,
the Middle East, and Central America. Chomsky

has lectured on linguistics and politics in many
countries and has received many academic honours. He was once described as “arguably the
most important intellectual alive.”
Chomsky is perhaps best known for his claim
that many properties of language are innate, that
is, the result of human genetic programming
rather than being learned from experience. He
came to prominence in the late 1950s when his
work played a major part in transforming linguistics from an esoteric discipline into a central
component of the human and cognitive sciences.
His vigorous critiques of structuralist linguistics
(Chomsky, 1964a) and the behaviorist psychology
with which it was linked (Chomsky, 1964b)
helped to establish his reputation (see Language
theories).
Chomsky developed a new approach to the
study of language. His starting point was dissatisfaction with the structuralist linguistics
favored by Harris. The structuralists had viewed
a language as a collection of utterances. The
English language, seen in this way, was everything
that speakers of English said and wrote, taken as
a whole. What, then, was a grammar of a language?
In abstract, mathematical terms it was a set of
formulae which specified the structure of this
collection of utterances. Chomsky’s early work
investigated the mathematical properties of this
set of formulae. He argued that there are an
infinite number of possible utterances, but that
the grammar must be finite, containing within
itself recursive mechanisms which enable it to characterize an infinite set of Structures. He further
argued that it is not possible to specify a “discovery
procedure” which starts with a language and
automatically produces a single correct grammar
(hence the dream of the structuralists was not
achievable).
Since a grammar is finite but a language is not,
the next step for Chomsky was to take a grammar
as the central object to be investigated, rather than
a language. A further reason for this is that any
language (considered as a set of utterances) will
contain many errors, false starts, repetitions,
coughs, splutters, and so on. The grammar, on the
other hand, the thing that speakers of a language
have in common, presumably does not contain
any of these blemishes. But if a grammar is not
a physical thing, like a set of utterances, what is
it? The only sensible answer, Chomsky concluded,

Chomsky, Noam

desire to mother” and sons for whom masculinity means male superiority and “whose nurturant
capacities and needs have been systematically
curtailed and repressed” (1978, p. 7). Thus sexual asymmetry and inequality are not “natural”
but sociological and psychological facts reproduced
in and by each generation. The political implications were clear: “a fundamental reorganization
of parenting [is necessary], so that primary parenting is shared between men and women”
(1978, p. 215).
In her later work, including essays collected
in Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory (1989),
Chodorow no longer argues that male dominance has a single cause, nor that gender differences
are always implicated in relations of inequality.
Responding to materialists’ criticism that psychoanalysis lacks historical and cultural specificity,
Chodorow has become more interested in
understanding social change and in producing
accounts more attentive to differences among
women (such as Race, Class, and Ethnicity),
the multivocality of women’s narratives, and the
plurality of women’s social, psychological, and
cultural identities.

Masculinity; Psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism.

was this: a complete grammar of a language
must be regarded as a model of the knowledge in
the mind of a person who speaks that language
(a “native speaker”).
Now further questions arise, in particular, the
question of how this grammar comes to be in the
brain of a speaker of a language. The structuralist
answer was that it was learned from experience,
and it is true that a young person acquires the
grammar of the language spoken around him or
her. There are certain things about grammars,
however, which suggest strongly that this cannot
be the whole story. As we saw, a discovery procedure for a grammar is not feasible. If a grammar
is learned, then it must be by trial and error on
the part of young people, since they are certainly
not “taught” their first language by adults
(indeed, when adults attempt to do this they
usually make the task harder rather than easier).
But trial and error is not a plausible answer
either, since despite very different experiences of
language, all children exposed to English acquire
the SAME grammar of English: different people’s
grammars are remarkably uniform, with much
less variation than, say, in their hairstyles or
tastes in music. What is more, the order in
which different parts of grammar are acquired is
remarkably constant across children and across
languages.
Our genetic endowment accounts for the
twofold uniformity of language acquisition, and
also explains how certain rules of grammar are
acquired in the absence of any data that would
warrant them. Such rules (and there are many
of them) could be learned only if young people
were systematically taught that certain structures are NOT grammatical. But children are
not taught this. Genetics is the only possible
solution.
Chomsky’s research program aims to specify the
genetic properties of language. The first step is
to provide a partial Generative grammar of a
particular language. The second is to isolate those
rules and principles of this generative grammar
which could not have been learned. The third
step is to generalize these rules and principles as
widely as possible and to propose that they are
part of Universal Grammar (UG), a model of the
genetic properties of language (in earlier work
UG was called the Language Acquisition Device
(LAD). Finally, other languages are investigated

to evaluate the proposals about UG. Any
hypothesis about UG must be broad enough to
allow for all human languages, but narrow
enough to exclude things that are not possible
human languages. It should be noted that devising a generative grammar is only one step in this
process, and that UG is the ultimate goal. Using
the term “generative grammar” as a label for
Chomsky’s approach to language is therefore
misleading: a better name is “language as a
biological system.”
Chomsky’s theoretical framework has been
extremely influential, within both linguistics and
neighboring fields such as psychology and philosophy. His ideas remain highly controversial,
however (for an outline of the main criticisms see
Salkie, 1990, pp. 96–120).

`city 
The ancient world provides us with two
mythic origins and originators for the city. There
is Plutarch’s Theseus, the legendary founder of
Athens, whose city is organized, coherent, reasoned
and reasonable, abstract, bound and guarded by
laws. Then there is the city of Cain; for, in the
Bible, it is Cain – a cursed and banished murderer, a marked man condemned to be a vagrant
and vagabond – who builds the first city. Since
Cain was a criminal, a fugitive, a nomad, we may
think of a city full of aliens, vagrants; anonymity, randomness; the lost and the damned. The
city, particularly as it has developed during
the last 200 years, has often aspired to the condition of Theseus’s Athens; but it has more
often been described as being more like a city of
Cain.
The city and Western literature are effectively
coeval. But the great literary concentration,

127

How often, in the overflowing streets,
Have I gone forward with the crowd and said
Unto myself, “The face of every one
That passes me is a mystery!”
(Prelude, Book VII)

Edgar Allan Poe caught this memorably in “The
Man of the Crowd,” the first story of urban
anomie, which was to become a key text for
Walter Benjamin. Poe also, effectively, invented
the detective story (“The murders in the rue
Morgue”), which turned out to prove an ideal
genre for tracking the clues of the mysteries and
crimes spawned by the modern metropolis. The
miseries of this new crowd of strangers, particularly of the new urban proletariat, provoked
different cries of outrage from principled
Victorians, which could point towards a radical
politics. As in the case of Engels: “however much
one may be aware that this isolation of the individual, this narrow self-seeking is the fundamental
principle of our society everywhere, it is nowhere
so shamelessly barefaced, so self-conscious as
just here in the crowding of the great city. The
dissolution of mankind into monads . . . is here
carried out to its utmost extremes” (The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844).
On a more personal level, James Thomson
recorded how the city could become phantasmagoric, a nightmare of tormented consciousness,
in City of Dreadful Night (1870).
The Futurist Manifesto of 1909 first identified
the city as the preeminent theme of modern
literature and painting; and it was Ezra Pound
who pointed out that while “the life of the village
is narrative . . . In a city the visual impressions
succeed each other, overlap, overcross, they are
cinematographic.” A number of major twentieth-

century novels give us just such a “cinematographic,” disintegrative, discontinuous, explosive
rendering of the city – for instance, Bely’s
Petersburg (1913), Döblin’s Berlin Alexanderplatz
(1929), and Céline’s Voyage au bout de la nuit
(1932). But the nineteenth century had already
seen the growth of a rich tradition of a literature
of the city. London is not the background or
setting for Charles Dickens’s novels – it is the
protagonist, with a terrible energy and power,
of which his human characters are simply more
or less functioning fragments. (See the opening
paragraph of Bleak House.) Honoré de Balzac
immersed himself in Paris – the high life, the low
life; the streets, the shops, the money, the clothes,
the food; the crowds, the shocks, the collisions;
and the endless circulation of peculiarly modern
desires and dissatisfactions engendered by the
modern city. Charles Baudelaire – who created the
image of the poet as city flâneur – was, arguably,
the first great poet of the city, and he saw
Balzac’s city-haunting characters as true heroes
compared to the “pygmies” of the Iliad, and
Balzac himself as the greatest hero of all.
Where the varied landscapes of the cultural
past seemed relatively knowable and describable,
the modern city, protean, amorphous, incoherent, always expanding and in flux, posed new
problems of representation. And the city was
coming to be felt to be everywhere; it seemed
there was no place or point outside it from
which it could be seen and comprehended as
a whole (as pastoral and Romantic poets had
often “surveyed” the landscapes stretching out
before or beneath them). We may take T.S. Eliot
and James Joyce as representing two ways of
responding to, and representing, the modern
city. Eliot’s The Waste Land evokes the generic
modern city as fragmented, polluted, sterile,
collapsing – “unreal”:
Falling towers
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria
Vienna London
Unreal.
(lines 373–6)

Joyce’s Ulysses, with its massive recreation of the
teeming life of one Dublin day, using the whole
range of possible literary styles as it walks through
the city, listening to its many voices, offers a

city

exploration, and evocation of the city really
starts in the nineteenth century. This was when
the city started to become both mysterious
and ubiquitous, unknowable and inescapable,
housing the past and determining – or destroying – the future. Increasingly, meaning no
longer comes from the church, the court, or the
manor, but is produced – and reproduced – in
the city.
Already Wordsworth was realizing that “the
great city” was producing a new kind of experience, perhaps a new kind of person:

city

128
much more fecund and festive sense of the
modern city; though here, too, with intimations
of ultimate meaninglessness:
Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing
away too: other coming on, passing on. Houses,
lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements, piled
up bricks, stones. . . . Piled up in cities, worn
away age after age. Pyramids in sand.

Yet the city offered writers a great deal to
stimulate them. Robert Musil, whose city was
Vienna, wrote, in his great work The Man
Without Qualities, that the city afforded “irregularity, change, sliding forward, not keeping in
step, collisions of things and affairs” – “a tangle
of forces” generating “the well-known incoherency of ideas, with their way of spreading out
without a central point . . . without a basic
unity.” More basically, the city offered cheap
paper, easier publishing opportunities, and a
growing market for books and magazines –
not to mention a concentration of libraries,
academies, museums, and galleries. In the city the
writer could become, for the first time, his own
master – independent of the uncertain patronage
of an unpredictable court and a quixotic aristocracy. The relatively fixed and stable routines
of rural life were superseded by new experiences
of mobility, complexity, variety, openness, and
change. The modern city saw new social,
economic, and cultural relations being formed,
along with enriched and facilitated intercultural communications, and new metropolitan
sophistications. It is hardly too much to say that
modern literature is predominantly an urban
product. And yet, the response of many modern
writers to the city has been antagonistic, adversarial, denunciatory; often provoking nostalgic
yearnings for some imagined lost world – rural
or preindustrial – of stability, security, and
reassuring familiarity. Rilke’s The Notebooks of
Malta Laurids Brigge (1910) records his experience
of Paris, and it starts: “So this is where people come
to live; I’d have thought it was a place to come
and die.” The city never sleeps, and never lets
him sleep – “electric trams hurtle ringing
through my room. Automobiles ride across
me.” But – being a writer – he is determined to
find an appropriate mode of response: “I’m
learning to see. Yes, I am beginning. It’s not

going very well yet. But I intend to make the most
of my time.” In the event, he makes an imaginative journey back into his childhood. However,
one may take a more general point. The modern
city forced artists – writers; painters (Monet,
Meidner, Munch, Kirchner, Boccioni, Delaunay,
Grosz, Dix – painting the city as everything
from a new technological Arcadia to a new
kind of hell on earth); and of course filmmakers (Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, 1926) – to see in
new ways. There was a major perceptual shift,
and we can no longer look at the world with
pre-city eyes.
Of course, artists create their own cities, as
Henry James indicated when he wrote of
“making a mere Rome of words, talking of a
Rome of my own which was no Rome of reality

The Stones of Venice, which was a rare state of the
imagination indeed, and had an incalculable
effect on subsequent literature. But the modern
city seems not to lend itself to such confident
recuperations. Kafka is perhaps the quintessential
writer of experience in the modern city, and here
is one of his complete fragments – fitting form
for the city.

`civil society
 A term which in contemporary
discussion is generally used to mean a social
sphere of freedom, voluntary association, and
plurality of human relationships, identities,
differences, and values as contrasted with the
coercive political power of state and government
(Keane, 1988b). Several social and political factors help to explain the current popularity of this
idea: the rise of autonomous social movements
(for example, peace and environmentalist movements, liberation movements of women, gays,
and black people); the conspicuous failures of
Western social-democratic parties and governments over the last 20 years; and the experience
of political dictatorship and state oppression
under the former Soviet and Eastern European
regimes, the growth of opposition movements (for
example, Solidarity in Poland), the overthrow/
collapse of those regimes, and the fragmentation
of many of the states which they governed.
Flowing from such experiences, the argument
has been developed both in the West and in
Eastern Europe that strengthening the associations,
movements, and institutions of civil society is fundamental to the successful pursuit of increased
freedom, equality, and democracy at the level of
both society and the state (Keane, 1988a).
This usage of “civil society” partly derives
from the revival of the term earlier this century
by Gramsci. However, there is a vital difference.
For Gramsci the concept is central to his critique
of capitalist society (Gramsci, 1971). Western
European capitalist societies, according to
Gramsci, are governed not only by the coercive
powers of the state, but also by the maintenance
of consent to bourgeois Hegemony (roughly,
intellectual and cultural leadership) in the realm
of civil society. In the associations and institutions
of civil society the bourgeoisie maintains its
social dominance through the influence of its
ideas and cultural products. Thus, for Gramsci,

civil society is a vital terrain on which capitalism
must be fought. While Gramsci’s use of civil
society here is not free from problems (Hunt,
1986), it is nevertheless intended as a central
element in a critique of capitalism. However,
this forthrightly anti-capitalist deployment of
the concept has now largely fallen into abeyance.
This is but the latest in a series of shifts of meaning which the idea of civil society has undergone, and the diversity of meanings which the term
has carried since it originated in the seventeenth
century has given it an elusive and ambiguous
character (Honneth, 1993; Tester, 1992).
Hegel was the first theorist to draw a clear
distinction between civil society and the state
(Hegel, 1821). Earlier writers, such as Hobbes,
Locke, and Rousseau, despite the deep theoretical
differences which divided them, had identified
civil society with the creation of the modern
state. But for Hegel, civil society is the social
realm within which egoistic individuals pursue
their “private” interests. Thus economic activities
such as work, the production and exchange of
goods, and the acquisition of property are central to Hegel’s view of civil society, though he also
includes other important elements such as ethical, cultural, and educational features. The state,
on the other hand, is concerned with the pursuit
of the general interest of the whole community.
It is a structure of political authority which is
separate from civil society and only very loosely
representative of it. One of the main purposes
of the state is to integrate disparate egoistic
individuals into a unified community. Thus, for
Hegel, despite this innovative distinction, the
state remains fundamental to the existence and
functioning of civil society.
In his early writings Marx accepted Hegel’s distinction between civil society and the state while
arguing against Hegel: first, that civil society is the
foundation of the state and not vice versa; and
second, for a radical democratization of the state.
However, Marx became increasingly critical of the
idea of civil society and a developed critique of it
may be found in his later work (Hunt, 1987). Marx
analyzes modern capitalist society as a social
formation with a distinctive economic structure
containing social classes of very unequal power.
This implies that social relations, and not only the
applications of state power, are systematically
coercive in character, and that this coercion

flows from the fundamental structure of society.
While on the surface society appears to consist
of free individuals pursuing their interests by
entering into voluntary association with each
other, the underlying reality, according to
Marx’s critique, is that with its monopoly of the
means of production a wealthy minority coerces,
oppresses, and exploits the majority. The concept
of civil society as an expression of the surface
appearances of capitalist society is thus profoundly misleading.
Contemporary proponents of civil society tend
to reject this Marxist critique on the grounds that
it is “reductionist” and “economistic” in locating
the main source of coercive power in capitalist society in its economic and class structure (Keane,
1988a). They tend to argue that the sources of
power in modern society are too pluralistic and
heterogeneous to be accounted for in this way.
Instead, society is seen as an arena within which
individuals of diverse identities associate in a
multiplicity of ways in pursuit of their goals, and
engage in a variety of forms of resistance to the
many different sources of power and coercion.
Civil society is upheld as the key notion required
to conceptualize the potential for freedom and
liberation which this arena contains.
In viewing society as a sphere within which
disparate individuals relate in diverse ways, and
in understating (or even ignoring) questions of
social structure and class, there is a strong tendency for this contemporary defence of civil
society to remain confined within a liberal
theoretical framework, despite the more radical
language in which it is expressed. As against this,
the relevance and validity of the Marxist critique
continues to be upheld by some writers. One
such critic is Wood, who argues that while the
pursuit of freedom, equality, and democracy
must certainly entail resistance to all forms of
social and political oppression, crucially it must
include opposition to the systematic coercion
and exploitation inherent in capitalist social
relations. She maintains that many contemporary
theorists of civil society “conceptualize away the
problem of capitalism” by dissolving it “into an
unstructured and undifferentiated plurality of
social institutions and relations” (Wood, 1990,
pp. 60, 66–7), with the result that the idea of civil
society obscures and mystifies vital social issues
rather than illuminating them.

`Cixous, Hélène (1937–)
 French feminist,
writer, and critic. Cixous is the leading French
feminist associated with écriture féminine, a
Discourse which originates in the pre-Oedipal
drives of the body. Writing these “bodily” sensations serves to disrupt the symbolic (male)
language/order. Her work draws on a variety
of intellectual influences, Psychoanalysis,
Deconstruction, history, and criticism, but
submits to none of them. Despite a wide range
of published material, including her early work
on James Joyce, in England and America, she
is chiefly represented by three main essays:
“Sorties,” “The Laugh of the Medusa,” and
“Coming to Writing.” The account that follows
is based primarily on these works.
The disruptive potential of écriture féminine
is predicated on the organization of Culture
and representation around the primary term of
the male/female opposition, “‘the’ couple, man/
woman” (1975, p. 64), where the female is
figured as the negative underside to the male
Hegemony. This culture, Cixous argues, has
resulted in the relegation of woman to the other,
and the denial of her own access to the pleasure
of her Body, “Shut out of his system’s space,
she is the repressed that ensures the system’s
functioning” (1975, p. 67). This System is one
based on hierarchy and opposition, where the
traditional equation of the male with activity,
and the female with passivity, posits the female
as nonexistent and unthought. Thus the opposition is not a couple, and the feminine is merely
a space or a lack subjected to male desire. She is
thus a nonpresence, even to herself, dislocated
from her own body and its desire. Cixous uses
her experience of colonization in Algeria as a

131
a sex.” This presence of the other, of difference,
is particularly applicable to women, as within a
Freudian system they are bisexual, owing to to the
requirement that they change the object of desire
from the mother to the father. It is this coexistence of the other and difference, and their
endless interplay, which constitutes woman’s
“instinctual economy,” or her jouissance, which
cannot be referred to, or described, by masculine
discourse.
For Cixous, writing itself is the place of the
other, where identities are questioned and
changed. Woman writing herself will enact a
return to her confiscated body, the gateway to
the unconscious. The Writing of the body, via
an unsettling of the speech/writing distinction
and the return of the repressed, will serve to disrupt the binary, hierarchical structures, for this
writing means “non-exclusion.” Cixous insists
upon the fact that this “feminine practice of
writing” cannot be defined or theorized, for to do
so would signal a return to the old systems of logic.
Unlike Irigaray, she argues that écriture féminine
is not exclusively tied to the biological sex of the
writer, but to the capacity to include the other –
Jean Genet is one of her examples of a “feminine”
writer. This distinction would seem to confound
those of her critics who have claimed that her ideas
depend upon an unproblematized biological
determinism.
The blowing up of the Law which has exiled
the other is an event which will happen in language, by writing with “the unimpeded tongue that
bursts partitions, classes and rhetorics, orders and
codes” (1975, pp. 94–5). A model that exemplifies
this revolutionary return of the repressed for
Cixous is the hysteric, who confounded Freud’s
laws by fragmenting and disrupting language.
Woman is to displace the opposing male
signifier, to overturn it, but not to make it hers,
for this would leave the structure itself intact.
This demand to disrupt and borrow, but not to
appropriate, is signalled by Cixous’s complex
puns and word-plays, for example, that on voler
(in French the verb means both “to fly” and “to
steal”): “To fly/steal is woman’s gesture, to steal
into language to make it fly.” The woman writing
will fly/steal her confiscated body, to which she
will then return.
Cixous’s belief in the power of writing to
express a female Imaginary which will undo the

Cixous, Hélène

metaphor to describe the power relations
operative in this process of objectification and
appropriation, whereby dominance requires the
expulsion of the strange: the colonized body/
country is the “dark continent,” infinitely other,
but with the power to threaten associated with the
return of the repressed.
Like Irigaray, Cixous analyzes the dependence of the male economy of desire on looking –
Freud’s theory (and that of Lacan) is “a
voyeur’s theory” (1975, p. 82) – and thus upon
the objectification, expulsion, and fragmentation
of the feminine. The operative distinction is
between the “self-same” and the other, yet the
other cannot be theorized without being assimilated into dialectic. She argues that the (male)
Subject goes out into the Other in order to come
back to itself; thus desire for the other is really
desire for the self; an economy refuted by the feminine, which is plural in its drives and desires.
The difference of woman from man lies not
only in her status as repressed and “other,” but
also in her capacity for maternity, bisexuality,
and plurality. Moreover, each of these also
contains within it subversive and disruptive
potential. The relation designated by Cixous as
the “m/other relation” provides a model for the
overturning of the “Empire of the Selfsame”
(1975, p. 78): she argues that the sex-specific
role of nurturing and giving birth facilitates the
acceptance of disruptions to the self, characteristic of the encounter with the other (1975, pp. 74
and 90). This unregretful splitting apart of subjectivity marks her specific libidinal economy –
her jouissance. The maternal relation functions
without appropriation or the erasure of difference,
and thus enables plurality to come into play; the
“gift” economy where all is given, and nothing is
expected in return. This celebration of the revolutionary potential of mothering is one part of
Cixous’s project of (re)gaining power from the
male order; she argues that the maternal role has
been assimilated into the paternal, so that the
primary social and economic relation becomes that
between father and child (1975, p. 101).
However, the feminine is not only repressed for
women, but for men also, who have denied the
Femininity of male sexuality. Thus bisexuality
provides another model for disruption as it is
“the location within oneself of the presence of
both sexes . . . the nonexclusion of difference or

Binary oppositions upon which her exclusion
rests, draws upon much contemporary French
philosophy – the work of Derrida in particular.
Attention to the gaps and silences of language and
texts will unsettle the Hegemony of male
Discourse and culture. Her own writing provides
an example of this: her work resists definitions
such as fiction or theory, as she collapses generic
distinctions, and disrupts the linear logic of male
language, breaking up the Text and destabilizing
meaning. Often dismissed as utopian, Cixous
does offer a theory which enacts the possibility for
radical change, without simply reproducing the
Structures which oppress.

`class
 During the Industrial Revolution, the
term came to refer both to a group of persons
sharing common social or economic status and
to persons engaged in common economic activities. The political economists of the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries tied status more firmly
to economic role or function, with the discussion
of the three great classes (landlords, capitalists,
and laborers) in J.S. Mill and D. Ricardo. The
decisive step from taxonomy to teleology was
taken by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, whose
polemical writings divide humankind under
capitalism into two classes, wage-laborers who
produce surplus and capitalists who appropriate
it. The bourgeoisie and the proletariat, each with
its own consciousness and organization, form “two
great hostile camps,” locked in a class struggle
whose inevitable outcome is the demise of capitalism and the birth of socialism/communism.
Thus Marx and Engels wove together considerations of status, economic function, political
consciousness, and human destiny into the wellknown revolutionary claim in the Communist
Manifesto: “The history of all hitherto existing
society is the history of class struggles” (Marx,
Engels, 1848). Much of the twentieth-century
theorizing about class has since wrestled with the
two intertwined problematics of the taxonomy
of class and the teleology of class struggle. The taxonomic debate has tended to remain bounded
by the categories of political economy, focusing
on the functional classification of the new
middle classes, while scholars concerned with
the teleology of class have addressed issues of
agency, Culture, and consciousness, moving
rather far afield from Marxist political economy.
Still, no matter how far from Capital the debate
has strayed, Marx’s original conceptions continue
to define the shape and logic of the argument.
In fact, one could argue that the burden of
twentieth-century thought on class has been
the task of rehabilitation, elaboration, Deconstruction, and contestation of Marx’s original
construction of class, that to criticize Marxist
conceptions of class, one must stand in the space
that Marx cleared.
The earliest to claim the terrain was Max
Weber, who shifted the analysis of class from the
sphere of production to that of consumption,
focusing on conflicts among status groups who
share similar material standards of living, and

133
resting on political and ideological criteria alongside economic criteria. In placing this group on
the capitalist side of the “boundary problem,” however, Poulantzas destroyed the working class,
whose tiny numbers hardly seem adequate to the
task of building a revolution. Harry Braverman
(1974) saw the process of “deskilling” as proceeding at such a pace that the new middle class
would inevitably be proletarianized. Erik Olin
Wright (1985) took up the question of whitecollar work, seeking to retain the criteria of
exploitation and appropriation as essential in
any taxonomy of class. Wright introduced the
notion of contradictory class locations to explain
white-collar workers as simultaneously occupying
positions in both the capitalist and the working
class. Similarly, Wright defines mediated class
relations, where an individual might occupy one
class position as a result of her own class, but be
linked to another by marriage, and temporal
class locations, entailing changes in the nature
of an individual’s work over her career trajectory.
As both his critics and his supporters acknowledge, Wright’s theoretical moves are an attempt
to provide greater complexity to the starkness of
the picture painted by the Manifesto, while
retaining the privileged status of class relations
in the larger Marxist analysis (and project) of
historical change.
Responding to his critics, Wright (1989)
points out that the problem of understanding
the middle class presents neo-Marxists with a
“Weberian temptation” to abandon notions of
exploitation and appropriation; the Weberian
solution relieves Marxists of the theoretical
“burdens” on class analysis that are present in a
theory that must span historical modes of production and explain the logic of exploitation and
class antagonism. But for Wright, the choice of
Marxism over Weberian approaches is simultaneously the expression of a methodological
preference for systematic rather than ad hoc
specifications and a political decision to ally
himself with the Marxist tradition, which in
his view “remains the most comprehensive and
productive general framework for developing
macrostructural theory of large-scale emancipatory possibilities.”
Thus, the taxonomic question is simultaneously political and teleological. In seeking to
delimit class boundaries and to situate particular

class

are thus differentiated on the basis of market
relations and life chances, and also on the role of
political parties, especially those organized along
lines of ethnicity and nationality. Thus, the
subordinate place accorded to economic class
by Weber, whose antagonism to Marxism was
marked and well known, stands in contrast to the
privileged position accorded class by Marx and
later neo-Marxists. Still, one should not overstate
the distinctions between Marxist and Weberian
taxonomies of class: neo-Weberians acknowledge
the importance of class definitions based on economic production, while neo-Marxists recognize
the role played by status, party, and nation. Commenting on the extent to which neo-Marxists
have come to acknowledge the role of other forms
of group identification, Frank Parkin (1979)
noted, “Inside every neo-Marxist there seems to
be a Weberian struggling to get out.” Parkin
worked explicitly in the Weberian vein, focusing
on the notion of social closure as the key element
of exclusion by which classes are constructed.
In his view, ruling classes achieve closure by
monopolizing “exoteric” knowledge and armed
force, not only economic resources such as land
or capital. Anthony Giddens, standing simultaneously in the Weberian and Marxist traditions,
shifted the discussion from class boundaries to the
process of “class structuration,” which depends not
only on the degree of closure in “distributive
groupings,” but also on the division of labor
within organizations, and the mechanisms of control in the workplace. Pierre Bourdieu (1984)
further attenuated the link between economic
relations and class analysis in his notions of a class
“habitus” and the transmission of class capital,
neither of which is exclusively material or centered
on the workplace.
A substantial body of empirical and theoretical
work has sought to rescue Marxist class analysis
from the straitjacket of the two-class model.
Much of this work has been motivated by the
emergence of new middle groups of white-collar
workers such as clerical, managerial, and professional employees who do not fit neatly into
the simple polarities of polemical Marxism. For
Nicos Poulantzas (1975), white-collar workers,
whose work consists of the distribution and
circulation of commodities rather than their
production, constituted a new petty bourgeoisie
whose class position must be understood as

class

134
groups of workers, neo-Marxist theorists have
hoped to understand why the working classes
in Western industrialized countries have not
organized themselves to overthrow capitalism
and why other non-class axes of organization,
including religion or nationality, have proven so
potent in recent decades. Michele Barrett (1991),
writing about “Marxisant treatments of sociology,
politics and economics,” argues that “there has
been a potential for engagement with the actuality of non-class divisions, but (to express the
situation tactfully) this has remained in many
instances a potential rather than a nettle to be
grasped.”
A more promising avenue for analysis of the
role of class and nonclass divisions was opened
up with the critique of economism, reductionism,
and class essentialism that transformed Western
Marxism in the twentieth century. As early as the
1920s, authors such as Antonio Gramsci, Georg
Lukács, and members of the Frankfurt school
broke free of political economy to embrace
studies of psychology, philosophy, culture, and
politics. Focusing on class consciousness, most
likely in response to the emergence of new
middle classes and the reformist character of
working-class parties in Western Europe, these
authors developed a powerful critique of Soviet
Marxism’s Positivism, economism, and teleological leanings, and in the process began to
accord less pride of place to class analysis. While
the extent to which Gramsci’s analysis dethrones
class is in dispute, his work on Hegemony has
proven enormously influential in understanding political and cultural processes by which
dominating classes achieve the consent of the
dominated, and clearly contribute to the critique
of economism. Stuart Hall’s dissection of
Thatcherism in The Great Moving Right Show,
for instance, draws heavily on Gramsci to provide
important, if controversial, insights into workingclass support for Tory governments. Others
contributing to the critique of class essentialism
include Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe
(1985), whose work has been hailed for its definitive break with reductionism. Declaring themselves
to the “post-Marxist,” they reject all “normative
epistemologies” and “universal Discourses” in
Hegemony and Socialist Strategy. In their view, even
Gramsci remained tied to economistic definitions
of class and to necessary rather than contingent

views of the role of the working class in history.
Critics of class essentialism have pointed to
the rise in the latter half of the twentieth century
of radical social movements that contest limits
placed upon persons because of Gender, race,
nationality, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. The
class position of women had long posed problems
for Marxism, and led to a series of unsuccessful
attempts, such as the domestic labor debate, to
subsume gender into the terms of Marxist class
categories. Feminists have attacked such attempts
to restore the primacy of class, in analysis of
autonomous gender interests as an explanation
and motor for contemporary political and social
events. In the process, a debate formed around
the interaction of class and gender, or the systemic
relationship between capitalism and Patriarchy,
with one group of theorists arguing that these two
operate autonomously (dual systems theory),
while others seek to develop various versions of
a unified theory. The salience of nationalities as
motors of human history has also become ever
more clear with the rise of religious and nationalistic movements around the world, and analysis
of race, nationality, and ethnicity is proving to
be an enormously rich terrain for cultural and
political work.
The question that remains is whether class
analysis has been “superseded.” Certainly the
critiques of class essentialism have shifted the
focus away from class analysis in cultural studies,
but political economy continues to accord class
pride of place. Finally, it is perhaps ironic that
alternative explanations of politics have arisen
precisely at the moment when in both Britain and
the United States the class nature of contemporary politics has become even more glaring, and
at the moment when global capitalism and its
monoculture appear to be on a triumphal march
against cultural specificities of all types. As
Barrett (1991) points out, the very term “new social
movement” implies that a movement is new
because it is not class based; that is, the logic of
class continues to overshadow even the most
determined rejection of class analytics. When
standing in the space Marx has cleared, we continue to feel his presence.

`classical realism
 A term used mainly by
Marxist and poststructuralist critics to denote the
various generic conventions that (supposedly)
characterized fictional writing during the period
of high bourgeois aesthetic and sociopolitical
Hegemony. For some Marxists – Lukács among
them – such works still possessed a criticalemancipatory potential, a capacity to encompass
(to “concretely portray”) whole worlds of diverse
historical and social experience, and thus to
reveal the deep-laid conflicts of residual, dominant, and emergent ideologies. For others (for
example, Macherey and Eagleton) realism
often functions as a mode of false consciousness,
a smoothing-over of precisely those conflicts –
those stress points in its own ideological project
– which can emerge only through a reading
in the “symptomatic” mode. This antagonism
between rival schools of Marxist thought with
regard to the nature, status, and value of nineteenthcentury realism is reproduced in their respective
(sharply polarized) attitudes toward literary
Modernism and its programmatic break with
realist modes of writing. Thus, where Lukács
sees modernism as a symptom of late bourgeois
cultural decline, Eagleton and Macherey take a
modernizing lesson from Brecht in the various
techniques of critical reworking (Umfunktion-

ierung) which can draw out the ideological
subtexts – the latent contradictions of meaning
and structure – that inhabit the conventions of
classic bourgeois realism.
For poststructuralists like Roland Barthes
these conventions are likewise a mere artifice, a
ruse whereby the novel attempts to conceal or disavow all the signs of its own cultural production,
and thus masquerades as a window upon (or a
mirror held up to) reality. Worse still, it performs
this work of ideological recruitment by surreptitiously transforming culture into nature, or
passing off the values of its own time and place
as transcendent, ahistorical truths. Thus the rise
of the novel is seen as a cultural phenomenon that
reflects – and promotes – the emergence of a
dominant bourgeois ideology premised on those
same “commonsense” values of autonomous
selfhood, possessive individualism, transparent
access to “the real,” etc. The task of criticism,
conversely, is to analyze the various narrative
Codes and devices whereby such illusory values
are created and made to appear nothing less
than self-evident.
This project is carried through to most briliant
effect in Barthes’s S /Z, an exhaustive (almost
word-by-word) textual exegesis of Balzac’s
novella Sarrasine. Here we see the “classic realist
text” subjected to a process of disseminative
eading which begins by breaking it down into
561 fragments that Barthes calls “lexemes,” or
minimal distinctive units of narrative meaning, by
loose analogy with “phonemes” in the discourse
of structural linguistics. (See also Discourse,
Narratology, Structuralism.) Each of these
is then assigned to one or more of the five
“codes” – the proaieretic (code of actions and
events), Hermeneutic (code of puzzles and
enigmas), semic (code of character), cultural
(code of commonplace or received wisdom), and
symbolic (code of deep-laid collective unconscious (for example, gender-role) representation
– which traverse the narrative in a ceaseless
“polyphony” of intertextual echoes and allusions. Barthes’s purpose in all this is to foreground those moments of crosscode interference
or disruption which enable Sarrasine to figure as
an exemplary “limit-text,” that is, a work that
undermines the conventions of classic bourgeois
realism by exposing them to all manner of unresolved Paradox, Aporia, self-deconstructive

mise-en-abîme and suchlike obstacles to straightforward Readerly (lisible) consumption. To
this extent at least it is a Writerly (scriptible) text,
though one whose “parsimonious plurality” of
meaning is acknowledged as placing certain
constraints upon the range of possibilities thus
opened up.
There is much that is brilliant, provocative,
and liberating – as well as inspirational for the
jaded teacher of those “classic realist texts” – in
Barthes’s idiosyncratic commentary on Balzac’s
once neglected, now celebrated novella. Unfortunately, as often happens, his obiter dicta have
been turned by some poststructuralists into just
the kind of ironcast orthodoxy that Barthes was
so anxious to escape. At any rate there is more
to be said in defense of “naive” (or “bourgeois”)
realism, some of it said rather effectively by
old-school Marxists like Lukács.

characters): the Symbolic (plurality of meaning
as it is organized in the process of interpretation):
the proaieretic (sequences of actions, or plot);
and cultural (references to types of knowledge).
For Barthes, the interweaving of these five codes
is what constitutes the text, with no single code
achieving any kind of overall preponderance.
He reads through Balzac’s story, sorting it into
categories which are overdetermined by these
codes, interspersing it with his own critical text.
In so doing, he classifies pieces of text as elements
of the codes. Nevertheless, there are points at which
he invokes the reader as part of the production
of meaning, implying that codes do not completely
interpret the text. Since readers can vary, so too,
therefore, can the meanings produced, and this
problem threatens the provisional stability of his
structural codes.
Barthes himself moved on from this kind of
analysis into a concern with the multiplicity of
meaning. His cultural code became more and
more problematical, and was replaced with his
particular use of the concept of Intertextuality. In this respect he moves into the area
covered by Poststructuralism.

`comedy
 A form of dramatic or narrative plot
that emphasizes social integration. Whereas
tragedy typically leads to the isolation of a character by accentuating suffering or death, comedy
brings about the assimilation of characters into
a changed or renewed social order that celebrates marriage, new life, or communal stability.
Unlike the theory of tragedy, which has a long
tradition that extends back to Aristotle’s Poetics,
the theory of comedy is largely a product of
twentieth-century thought. Although it is commonly assumed that what is comic is the object
of laughter, this is not necessarily so. While
comic in the shape of its plot – because it traces
the journey of the lost soul through the terrors
of hell and the cleansing of purgatory in preparation for the union with God – the narrative
of Dante’s Divine Comedy is rarely humorous.
In his pioneering study “Laughter” (1900),
however, Henri Bergson emphasized the dependence of humor on social organization. The
typical object of laughter, he argued, is a human
manifestation of mechanical inelasticity, or a
rigidity of manner, belief, or personality. When
the exposure of such inelasticity leads to laughter, two groups are immediately formed: those
who laugh and those at whom the laughter is
directed. Laughter is thus a form of social criticism or a force for social conformity, in which
those who laugh see more or see differently from
those who are laughed at. The danger of laughter, for example, when it is directed against
Malvolio in Twelfth Night, is that the one against
whom it is directed may become permanently
alienated from the community that laughs. If the
laughter is generous and its object pliable, however, the result may be a release from rigidity and
an incorporation of the one who was formerly
excluded from the community into a new and
larger social order.
Writing independently of Bergson, Freud in
1905 published Jokes and Their Relation to the
Unconscious. An important function of jokes, he
argued, lies in their power to overcome a person’s
defenses against the content of a witicism, a

content that a person might ordinarily resist if it
were presented in another form. In this sense,
form becomes a verbal or artistic equivalent of a
psychological defense structure by making what
was threatening tolerable.
In 1948 Northrop Frye published his highly
influential essay “The argument of comedy,”
which he later expanded into a full comic theory
in Anatomy of Criticism. Frye noted that there are
two fundamentally different kinds of comedy:
one which descends from the “old comedy” of
Aristophanes and the other from the “new comedy” of Plautus and Terence. The basic assumption in the old comedy is that the structures of
society are immutable and that aberrations can
only be held up to ridicule. After a brief period
of festive holiday, life returns to normal and
conformity reasserts itself, or the deviant and
defiant are banished. But in the new comedy,
which had a profound influence on Shakespeare,
the basic assumption is that social structures can
be reshaped. Thus, what may begin as a rigidly
alienating social order, as at the beginning of
A Midsummer Night’s Dream or As You Like It,
can itself be transformed and made to conform
to individual human needs or desires. Such plots
often require a temporary escape from a rigid order
of law or custom, a sojourn into a natural place,
and then a return to a regenerated social world.
(Here the pattern is strikingly similar to that
outlined in the Bible in Isaiah 35–6.) Frye’s
account of old and new comedy historicizes the
tensions that Bergson and Freud detected in
laughter and jokes.
A common element in plots that include the
creation or regeneration of a vital social order is
that they depict or elicit a kind of ecstasy, literally a coming out of the self for the sake of
participation in a Ritual of artistic communion
that parallels or derives its power from religious
celebration.

magazine forms called comic books. The word
“comic” is a misnomer because, although many
are humorous, most comic books today relate
exciting adventure stories and drama. Despite
the efforts of many publishers and critics alike
to change the genre’s appellation to “sequential
art” or “graphic novels,” the term “comic”
appears to have stuck.
Comics have been praised as one of the few
uniquely American art forms. Although comic
art dates back to ancient times, such as cave
drawings, Egyptian hieroglyphics, and Greek
vases, the idea of putting words and pictures
together did not gain popularity until the 1700s.
In 1754 Benjamin Franklin urged the American
colonies to unite in his cartoon, “Join, or Die,”
depicting a segmented snake that represented
the disjointed colonies.
During the 1800s many American artists created
political cartoons, using such artforms as prints,
woodcuts, and lithographs. Harper’s Weekly regularly featured the extremely influential work of
Thomas Nast. In 1832 the French artist, Honoré
Daumier (known as the father of modern cartooning) served six months in prison for drawing a
caricature of King Louis Philippe entitled Gargantua. It would not be the last time the comic
artform would suffer such undue response.
In February 1896 the New York World newpaper tested its new yellow ink by printing it on
the main character in Richard F. Outcault’s
comic, “Hogan’s Alley.” It increased circulation
to such an extent that the future of the comic strip
was assured.
The basic idea of reprinting existing comic
strips into a tabloid did not originate until the early
1900s. That brainstorm can be attributed to
the famous journalist and publisher, William
Randolph Hearst, who gathered Outcault’s
“funnies” into a short-lived publication called
the Yellow Kid Magazine. It took more than three
decades before someone thought about collecting
new stories into the comic book form.
In 1933 Max Gaines published the first original
comic book, which was entitled Funnies on
Parade. Two years later Walt Disney entered the
industry, and the comics boom was under way.
By the end of the decade, many publishers who
had dealt with pulp fiction made the move to the
comics industry. The advent of these adventureoriented creators led to the birth of the pivotal

force that would define the future of comic
books for good or ill – the super hero. This super
hero was, of course, Superman, created by two
Cleveland college students, Jerry Siegel and Joe
Shuster. A year later, costumed characters such
as Batman, Captain America, the Sub-Mariner and
Captain Marvel proliferated in the printed page
of most comic magazines.
The 1939–45 war prompted the need for patriotic super heroes. Subtle propaganda for the war
effort depicted these heroes battling against the
villainy of the Third Reich. Several nonsuper
hero concepts emerged during this period, most
notably Archie in 1942.
After the war the popularity of the super hero
slowly declined, to be replaced with a growing
interest in humor, romance, science fiction, war,
and westerns. In 1950 William Gaines pioneered
several series of horror comics under the imprint
of Entertaining Comics (EC). Four years later,
however, a book entitled Seduction of the Innocent was published by Dr Frederic Wertham, a
longtime vociferous critic of comic books. Its
accusations led to public hearings by the US
Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile
Delinquency on the allegedly ill effects upon
children of reading comic books. These hearings
led to the institution of the self-regulatory
Comics Code Authority, which spelled the end for
EC’s horror line. Within a year, all EC books except
Mad were discontinued.
DC Comics, the publishers of Superman and
Batman, dominated the super hero market, or
what was left of it, for the next few years. Then
the creative team of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby at
Marvel Comics introduced The Fantastic Four
in 1961, followed by The Hulk and The Amazing
SpiderMan. Unlike their predecessors, these
characters were not perfect or godlike. They had
real human problems to which their audience
could relate.
Meanwhile, in 1967, the first “underground
comic,” Zap, was created by Robert Crumb.
Underground comics reflected the new freedom
of the late 1960s. They explored themes such
as sex, drugs, and the Counterculture movement through unique visual images.
The 1970s was a period of slight decline that
was turned around in the 1980s by the directdistribution market catering for comic book specialty
shops. This system nurtured the development of

139
(Pantheon, 1988) and the second volume, subtitled And Here My Troubles Began (Pantheon,
1991) a large number of general readers are for
the first time experiencing a new kind of adultoriented graphic storytelling. Maus has enjoyed
phenomenal success, including a long run on
the New York Times best-seller list and a welldeserved Pulitzer Prize. It dispenses with the
narrow conventions and existential confines
dictated by its comic predecessors.
At its most basic level, Maus is the story of
Vladek Spiegelman, a survivor of Auschwitz, as
told to his son, Artie. Spiegelman substitutes
animals for different types of humans. Jews are
portrayed as mice, Nazis as cats, and Americans
as dogs. This narrative device ironically casts the
human condition in a more harrowing light.
Spiegelman is acutely aware of the comic medium’s
power to make things very immediate, pushing
them into your mind in ways other media do not.
Unfortunately, most of the comics published
in the English-speaking world are still genrebound. This shortcoming is due to the fact that
most of the comic creators are those who grew up
reading comics. Thus it becomes a self-selecting
group. Until that mindset is challenged, comic
books, including ones like Maus, will continue to
be relegated to the juvenile section of your local
book store.

Nevertheless, many critics feel that creators

embraced comics as reading matter suitable for
adults, therefore their results have been a more
sophisticated product, both visually and thematically, than the super hero comics in the
United States. Recognizing an audience other

`communitarian ethics 
A currently influential movement of thought in Anglo-American
ethical and political philosophy, it holds that our
best – indeed our only – source of wisdom and
guidance in these matters is the appeal to what
counts as good, humane, responsible, or civilized
conduct according to the standards and values that
prevail within our own cultural community. This
means rejecting any “formalist” (for example,
Kantian) idea of ethical judgment as based on
abstract principles – or universal maxims – which
must then be somehow applied to particular
cases through the exercise of a faculty (“practical
reason”) that supposedly transcends all localized
differences of interest, custom, peer-group loyalty,
religious affiliation, political culture, etc. It is
simply not possible, these thinkers maintain, to
adopt such a standpoint above or beyond all
the values, beliefs, and social obligations that
constitute a shared way of life for the agents
concerned.
Alasdair MacIntyre’s controversial book After
Virtue (1980) provides the most elaborate statement of this communitarian position in ethics and
political theory. According to MacIntyre we live
in a world of fragmented beliefs and value systems which – as he describes them in the book’s
arresting first paragraph – resemble the wreckage
from some natural or manmade catastrophe,
some event that has left us with just bits and pieces
from which to reconstruct the science, the technology, and the entire lost Culture of Western
civilization. In ethical terms the catastrophe has
occurred through the loss of those organic values

– that sustaining sense of communal participation
and purpose – which once enabled a philosopher
like Aristotle to link the private with the public
virtues, or the conduct of a rich and fulfilling
individual life with the conduct of one’s affairs in
the wider (civic or sociopolitical) sphere. Thus the
history of Western post-Hellenic ethical thought
is the history of a long – indeed epochal –
decline into various forms of morally debilitating
dualism. Chief among these are the public/private
dichotomy, the split between “rational” and
“emotive” or “evaluative” orders of judgment,
and – equally disastrous in MacIntyre’s view – the
Kantian elevation of pure moral will into an
abstract (universal) set of maxims and imperatives. This produces the idea of morality as a law
whose very nature is to thwart all the pleasures
of a life lived in accordance with our best (most
humanly satisfying) forms of personal and collective endeavor.
Hence the predominantly somber cast of
MacIntyre’s historical reflections. What we have
lost, perhaps beyond recall, is that eudaimonic
(Aristotelian) conception of the virtues that saw
no need for any such conflict between moral
obligation and the natural desire to make the best
use of our innate dispositions, talents, and practical skills. This was a conception that equated
the good with a full and unimpeded exercise of
whatever activities conduced to our all-round
wellbeing as citizens, thinkers, artists, soldiers,
politicians, or creatures whose happiness is at
every point bound up with our role as members
of a flourishing cultural community. It also
included a certain narrative element, that is, a
capacity to view our own life-projects as contributing to a story whose meaning and significance derived from its enactment within that same
context of communally sanctioned purposes,
values, and beliefs. But again we have lived on,
as MacIntyre argues, into an epoch of splintered
value-spheres which set up a false dichotomy
between what is good for us as private individuals in quest of personal fulfillment and what is
good for “society” (or the public interest) conceived as imposing a stern moral check upon
our “lower,” self-seeking, unregenerate instincts
and desires. On occasion MacIntyre appears to be
suggesting that we might yet come up with some
replacement narrative, some revived sense of
communal meaning and purpose that would

141
deemed meaningful or worth a hearing by members of our communal peer group. So there is still
the question – as posed by MacIntyre – of what
could then count as an adequate reason or ethical
justification for opposing policies adopted in the
name of “liberal democracy” but serving to promote (say) the interests of US global Hegemony
or those of one particular well-placed socioeconomic group. Hence the very different senses of
the word “liberal” espoused on the one hand by
egalitarian thinkers like John Rawls, and on the
other by conservative defenders of a classical
free-market Liberalism such as Robert Nozick.
From Walzer’s communitarian standpoint one
would have to conclude simply that each way of
thinking had its place among the range of currently available options, and therefore that any
judgment between them could only be a matter
of private inclination or group loyalty.
This argument draws on various sources in
philosophy and Cultural theory. Hegel was
the first to criticize Kant for his abstract conception of morality and his failure to reckon
with the range of diverse value-commitments –
political, social, civic, and familial – that made up
the realm of Hegelian ethical Sittlichkeit. From
the later work of Wittgenstein it takes the idea
that we can go no further in explaining or
justifying certain “language games” or “forms of
life” than simply to remark that they make good
sense – and have no need of such justification –
when viewed in the context of our cultural traditions, linguistic practices, and so forth. There is
also a marked elective affinity between communitarian ethics and certain strains of postmodernist
thinking, not least on account of their shared
antipathy toward the truth claims and values of
Enlightenment critique. This kinship emerges
most clearly in the narrative turn – or the appeal
to “first-order natural pragmatic” story-telling
modes – which Jean-François Lyotard offers
as a postmodern substitute for those old (now
defunct) “meta-narrative” absolutes of freedom,
progress, justice, truth-at-the-end-of-inquiry, etc.
It is also evident in Richard Rorty’s neopragmatist
idea that truth is nothing more than what is
(currently and contingently) “good in the way of
belief.” On this view philosophy is best employed
in devising new narratives, metaphors, styles of
creative self-description, etc., by which to promote
the ongoing cultural “conversation of mankind.”

communitarian ethics

mend this chronically disabling condition of
divided moral identity. Elsewhere he writes more
in the gloomily diagnostic mode of one who
believes that the sickness is so far advanced that
no such salvation is any longer possible.
MacIntyre’s arguments are open to various
criticisms. One is that his ethical and political
values are deeply conservative, not only in their
backward-looking attachment to ancient Greek
notions of social virtue but also in their failure
to register – and criticize – the massive (indeed
structural) injustices that went along with the
Greek way of life. Thus he, like Aristotle, appears
oddly blind to the flagrant partiality (not to say
hypocrisy) of an ethics that on the one hand
cherishes this human need for enhanced selffulfillment through the exercise of everyone’s
innate gifts and talents, while on the other condoning the existence of a slave and female population defined (in effect) as subhuman and hence
proscribed from exerting any claim to possession
of those same gifts and talents. Another, more
generalized version of this criticism has to do
with the incapacity of communitarian ethics to
explain (or justify) the dissident stance of those
who on principle – or in good conscience – feel
obliged to reject the prevailing beliefs, customs,
values, or social mores of their own cultural
community. According to MacIntyre there is
just no way that such justification can be had,
requiring as it does an appeal to alternative
(extra-communal) grounds, reasons, or principles
which signal the lapse into yet another version of
those baneful Kantian antinomies.
This is not to suggest that all thinkers of a
communitarian persuasion adopt so deeply
conservative a view of the goods that we have lost
through our agelong slide into a medley of diverse,
competing ethical values. Some others – Michael
Walzer among them – adopt a pluralist outlook
which appears far removed from MacIntyre’s
position. Thus Walzer takes it as the chief virtue
of our present way of life in the Western Liberal
democracies that they are able to support such a
range of diverse creeds, ideologies, and lifestyles
without giving rise to fundamental conflicts that
would tear society apart. However, this pluralism
turns out to have certain limits, namely those
defined by our belonging to a given cultural
community within which some (and not other)
modes of speech, thought, and conduct are

Some critics – myself included – hold that this
amounts to nothing more than a handy pretext
for postmodern attitudes of uncritical acquiescence
in the current self-images of the age.

`comparative literature
 The study of literatures across frontiers. Originally coined in the
early nineteenth century, the term became highly
controversial in the twentieth century owing
to differing usages and interpretations. Some
scholars have seen it as essentially literary
history, following Goethe’s concept of Weltliteratur; some have seen it as a field of study
comparing the “soul” or “spirit” of different
Cultures; others have sought to demonstrate
the certainty or otherwise of “influence” between
writers. The so-called French school promoted
binary study between two authors or literary
Systems, in contrast to the American school
which argued for wide cross-disciplinary comparison. These two approaches were often
reflected in a terminological distinction that
sought to demonstrate a difference between

“comparative” and “general” literature. Emphasis
on the relationship between literature and
national culture in the nineteenth century led
to reaction in the twentieth century when comparative literature came under the dominance
of Formalism, and the focus was on belief in
the myth of the universal civilizing power of
literature regardless of cultural context.
Since the 1970s comparative literature has
moved away from the debates on what or how
to compare that had so concerned formalist
scholars. There has also been a move away from
the earlier focus on canonical Texts and prioritization of European and North American
literature in favour of a much broader systemic
approach that compares and contrasts means of
literary production, changing cultural contexts,
and the role of literary texts in different national
traditions. It is possible to argue that a great deal
of exciting, innovative work in comparative literature today is taking place in programs defined
variously as gender studies, Postcolonial
studies, intercultural studies. This tendency
reflects the abandonment of attempts to demonstrate that comparative literature is a discipline
in its own right in favor of an approach that sees
comparative literature as it was originally conceived
in the 1820s, that is, as a methodology.
Comparative literature today is a term used to
describe programs of study that cross national
or linguistic boundaries (for example, European
studies, African studies, Caribbean studies)
and to describe research that considers the transmission of texts across cultures. It draws upon
comparative anthropology, Discourse theory,
reception theory, Translation studies, Cultural materialism, and a range of other
approaches. In Europe and North America it is
primarily a term used to describe an approach to
literary study that is not restricted to a single
system and is in the process of shaking off its
formalist legacy. In other parts of the world it is
a term used to discuss the relationship between
national literature and other literary Systems
and is therefore an intensely politicized form of
literary study.
There is an international comparative literature
association and a large number of separate
national associations, many of which publish
their own journals and hold interdisciplinary
seminars and conferences.

social, economic, political, and cultural relations
requires comparative perspectives across time
and space. Race becomes a term of value, negative or positive, only when comparisons are
made, because comparisons produce differences
between us and them, between the self and the
other. Racialization is therefore also a psychological
mechanism and process. While race never stands
alone from other categories of difference such as
gender and class, its instrumentalization through
negative comparisons is at the core of the European colonial project that began towards the end
of the fifteenth century. Each instance of racialization in different historical periods and geographical contexts may be unique, but Western
colonialism, the event that heralded race as a
structuring principle, provides historical coherence
to the globalization of racial thinking and racism.
As a research method, to think racialization comparatively therefore means not only to analyze
specificities of each instance of racialization in
different historical periods and geographical
locations, but also to examine how the worldwide
colonial turn informs these specific instances to

be potentially related to one another. To think
comparatively therefore is to think about the
world where the colonial turn has left indelible
marks; that is, to think the worldliness of race.
The Matter of Comparison “The black man is
comparaison.” When Franz Fanon wrote this
enigmatic statement in chapter 7 of Peau noire,
masques blancs (1952; Black Skin, White Masks) he
meant comparison of two types, which he called
Adlerian and Antillean, respectively. In Alfred
Adler’s psychology of behavioral disorder, the ego
is supposed to want to be always greater than the
other to compensate for the injustice it has
suffered and inferiority it has been made to feel.
Adlerian comparison juxtaposes the ego and the
other and is a two-term relation. The black man,
who suffers an extreme case of this disorder,
always compares himself to other blacks, inferiorizing them to the point of wishing for their
“collapse,” turning them into objects who are
denied individuality and liberty, with the narcissism of “Me, me, me” hoisting up his painfully
constructed superiority (Fanon, 2008, pp. 185–7).
The fact that comparaison can be both French and
Creole and as a creolism is an adjective meaning “contemptuous” or “contemptible” further
emphasizes the disdain the black man feels
towards other blacks. Comparison is an enactment
of contempt onto others. In Adlerian comparison
the governing fiction is therefore personal; it is
about the comparison of one black man against
other black men, the contempt of one black men
for other black men.
The Antillean black man’s comparison obsession adds a layer of complexity to the Adlerian
model. For Fanon, the Antillean likely sees himself as white, and so when he compares himself
to other blacks, he does so “under the patronage
of the white man.” He judges other blacks with
white eyes. Comparison therefore involves three
terms here – the ego, the other, and the ideology
of whiteness – and changes the governing fiction
from the personal to the social. Fanon explains
that the source of the black man’s neurosis is not
other black men but the colonial society that has
educated the black man to see the world from
white perspectives. This is why the black man’s
neurosis is not an individual but a social symptom,
as the entire Antillean society is a “neurotic
society, a comparaison society.” This tripartite

relationship characterizes the Antillean comparison (Fanon, 2008, pp. 185–91).
Fanon’s astute movement from the individual
to the social brings the social – what he earlier in
the book called “the lived experience of the black
man” (2008, p. 89) – into psychoanalysis. Race is
a psychological experience, because it is a social
one, thanks to the Antillean’s ideological induction to whiteness through education or lived
experience of space. As a concrete example,
Fanon describes what it is like to walk down
different streets in Fort-de-France, where one
can determine which street is the “most comparaison,” depending on the degree to which the
black man feels “exposed” – that is, inferiorized
by other blacks (2008, p. 186). The street and
the classroom, like other spaces in the colony,
embody the material social where the whitederived, contempt-filled comparative consciousness is produced and activated, and then applied
to other blacks.
Comparison, as Fanon conceptualized it,
indexes the psychic and the social condition of
being colonized. In the colony, the black man’s
contempt is directed towards other black men,
while the subject himself lives the lie of his fictive
whiteness, as do the other black men. But when
the Antillean goes to the metropole, something
dramatic happens. Very simply, he becomes a
negro. No longer in the majority and now having direct encounters with the actual white gaze
– condescending, scornful, or phobic – the black
man is forced to give up his narcissism. He
himself becomes the object of contempt and
comparison, not only by the white people but
by himself, since he now also judges himself
from white perspectives. For the negro, this
metropolitan comparison and contempt is now
directed at the self, rather than at the others.
The self becomes its own object.
Two points about comparison can be drawn
from this reading of Fanon. First, the differences between the dynamics of racialization in
the colony and those in the metropole evince the
particularity of each instance as place-based (the
colony and the metropole) and time-specific
(the before and after of arrival in the metropole),
but in each instance, comparison is constitutive
of the process of racialization. Second, the black
man from the colony is the same man that goes
to the metropole, which shows that the two

different processes of racialization are contiguous.
This contiguity is not accidental, but is a historical consequence of the colonial turn. Comparison between the colony and the metropole,
this case shows, is about relationality, not relativism. If racialization is inherently comparative,
a psychosocial and historical process, then we
are working against the meaning of comparison
as the arbitrary juxtaposition of two terms in
difference and similarity, replacing it with comparison as the recognition and activation of
relations that entail two or more terms. This
second form of comparison brings submerged or
displaced relationalities into view and reveals
these relationalities as the starting point of a
fuller understanding of racialization as a comparative process.
In the United States, the call to go beyond the
black–white racial binary has motivated various
scholars to consider more nuanced relational
models for comparative racialization. One useful
example is Claire Jean Kim’s notion of racial
triangulation, which proposes that in the USA
there is a distinct triangulation process in the relationship among blacks, Asian Americans, and
whites. In this triangulation, Asian Americans
are granted “relative valorization” over blacks
but suffer from “civic ostracism” by the dominant
white society. Kim argues that racialization does
not take the form of either a single hierarchy
or separate trajectories for different peoples of
color but occurs in a “field of racial positions,”
and that these positions are also produced in
relation to each other. The model minoritization
of Asian Americans keeps black demands for
racial justice at bay and the civic ostracization of
Asian Americans ensures that they will never
gain equal footing with whites (Kim, 1999; also
see Lye, 2008).
Racial triangulation, in this usage, is an
effective heuristic device to bring into view
relationalities that conventional binary models
obscure or displace. If one places three related
terms under the pressure of triangulation, new
insights emerge. The ethical question, however,
pivots on the choice of what three terms to place
under pressure, on the selective valorization of
these three terms over others, and the possible
consequence of diminishing returns in regard to
interracial solidarities. The calls to go beyond the
black–white binary in American race studies are

Fanon has been credited as having been the
earliest in the twentieth century to theorize the
term “racialization” in Les damnés de la terre
(1961; The Wretched of the Earth) before sociologist Michael Banton took it up and gave the term
a detailed analysis in his 1977 book The Idea of
Race (see Murji and Solomos, 2007, p. 7). Fanon
ties racialization to comparison in a sense different from what has been discussed above. What
concerns Fanon is something he calls the racialisation de la pensée (“racialization of thought”) on
the part of the native intellectuals in Africa who
replicate the European colonizer’s tendency to
think of Africa as a single unit. Even though they
intend to use negritude and other positive constructions of Africanness to refute Eurocentric
condemnation of Africa, their pattern of thinking mimics that of the colonizer; hence their
thought is racialized.
According to Fanon, this tendency to think
of Africa as a single unit, whether cultural or
political, and not as an aggregate of geopolitically
specific nations and national cultures, led native
intellectuals to a “dead end.” The invention of
“African” culture as a unified “cultural matrix”
cannot overturn the presumed prestige of the
colonizers’ civilization and instead traps native
intellectuals in a reactive, non-transformative
act, which Fanon bitingly describes as mired in
“terribly sterile clichés,” engaging in a “banal
quest for the exotic,” or clinging to “a nucleus that
is increasingly shriveled, increasingly inert, and
increasingly hollow.” This cultural matrix, an
essentialized culturalism or culturalized essentialism recuperated through fossilized tradition,
is cut off from the real events of the day and the
need for concrete anticolonial political work that
must occur on the national level. For culture to
make a difference, it cannot be continental but
must first and foremost be national. In opposition to essentialized tradition, national culture
is a culture of becoming created by the people
who partake of it. Instead of perpetuating the
racialization of thought, which is an inverted
replication of colonial thinking, native intellectuals
must take objective comparisons among the
different nations and their histories in Africa
seriously and carefully, so that they are not just
comparing between old “coins” or “sarcophagi”
(Fanon, 2004, pp. 145–80). Racialized thought produces useless comparisons that serve no purpose

comparative racialization

more likely to result in new insights on Asian
Americans and Latinas/os (see Alcoff, 2000)
than on other people of color, especially Native
Americans. In other words, some terms may
appear more readily triangulatable than others,
while some may just disappear or fade into the
background, as happens with the binary model.
For instance, the call to transcend the binary has
not brought the case of Native Americans into
sustained triangulation; instead, a sanctioned
ignorance persists regarding how issues of Native
American rights, land, and cultural preservation
must unsettle the framing and articulation of
minority issues. Intellectual and political efforts
to join the causes of indigenous peoples with
those of minority groups have at best been
anemic, just as the racial state intentionally stalls
resolution of indigenous issues. Scholars suggested that W.E.B. Du Bois’s famous “colorline” statement, first published in 1897 and then
included in The Souls of Black Folk in 1903,
marked the moment that redness disappeared
from US racial imagination (Conn, 2004),
prompting Yael Ben-Zvi to ask, not without a tint
of sarcasm, “Where did red go?” Ben-Zvi argues
that Native Americans are viewed as the “vanishing
ancestors” of white America through which
redness is made to disappear into whiteness,
Native American culture and history becoming
a property inherited by the white national community. The disappearance of redness coincided
with the increased visibility of other colors in
different historical periods – black, yellow,
brown – and, after 9/11, the rise of Islamophobia
in search of a color and a race. The settler
colonialism of Asians in Hawaii vis-à-vis native
Hawaiians is another historical instance of triangulation among whites (haoles), Asians, and the
indigenous people that requires sustained analysis, but studies on this subject remain limited
(Fujikane, 2000; Trask, 2000).
Lest comparative racialization ends up displacing yet another marginalized group and
constructing yet another implicit hierarchy in a
contradiction of insight and blindness, empowerment and disempowerment, it must at each
instance be critical of its own assumptions and
conclusions. Here we may turn to Fanon again,
to his insistence on the specificity of a given
situation of racialization, and on the necessity to
demarcate the boundary of this situation rigorously.

146
but to reinforce the reification of culture and the
alienation of native intellectuals from their people.
From racialization as a comparative psychosocial process to the need to decolonize thought
by making useful comparisons and by thinking
culture nationally and creatively, Fanon clearly
links racialization to colonialism’s project as simultaneously psychological, socioeconomic, and
epistemological, and proposes that decolonization
has to be not only about politics but also about
psychology and epistemology. Decolonization
must also be a multidisciplinary, if not an
interdisciplinary, project, since the beginning of
racial thinking during the colonial turn was also
the advent of disciplinarity in more than one
sense of the word.
The Colonial Turn The sociologist Michael
Banton identifies racialization broadly, as a historical process “whereby a mode of categorization
was developed, applied tentatively in European
historical writing and then, more confidently, to
the populations of the world” (Banton, 1977,
pp. 18–19). The origin of racial discourse can be
traced back to the dawn of European colonialism
in the fifteenth century, the historical moment theorized by Emmanuel Wallerstein as the beginning
of the capitalist world system, heralding a process
of globalization that has intensified over the
centuries (Wallerstein, 2000). Race becomes a
concept around this time and it emerges contemporaneously with Spanish and Portuguese
colonialism in West Africa and the Americas
(Goldberg, 1993, pp. 21–4). The Spanish and
Portuguese empires having been on the wane
and replaced by French, German, and British
empires by the eighteenth century, scholars tie the
rise of the discourse of race more assuredly with
Enlightenment thought. Emmanuel Eze’s reader,
Race and the Enlightenment, gathers excerpts of
primary documents on race from the period,
showing how Enlightenment thinkers justified
racial hierarchy using arguments that could be
characterized as belonging to such disciplines as
natural history, climatology, evolutionary biology,
ethics, metaphysics, philosophy of history,
anthropology, and cultural geography.
David Theo Goldberg and Charles Mills offer
trenchant critiques of European philosophy from
classical liberalism and Enlightenment thought
to contemporary American pragmatism and

neoliberalism as having contributed to producing
historically specific forms of racial thinking.
For Goldberg, classical liberalism’s utilitarian
justification for colonialism, fictive construction
of morality, narrow and self-serving definition
of rationality, selective granting of rights, and
production of the “savage” formed a well rationalized and thorough set of arguments justifying
racisms of that time and after (Goldberg, 1993,
pp. 14–40). For Mills, the political theory of social
contract as elaborated by Hobbs, Rousseau,
Locke, and Kant, from the mid-seventeenth century to roughly the end of the eighteenth century,
is fundamentally informed by racial thinking.
It propagates a white supremacist political subjectivity, epistemology, and understanding and
practice of morality; it is supported by European
colonialism, American genocide, and the exploitation of slave labor – that is, through violence
and economic exploitation, as well as ideological
domination. The theory races non-white individuals into subpersons, and races non-white
spaces into spaces of ignorance and immorality;
in sum, it produces white supremacist values.
Moral and ethical philosophy has a racial underside, and the philosophers, suffering from a
“moral cognitive dysfunction,” exercise a sanctioned ignorance via evasion and self-deception
(Mills, 1997, p. 95). The social contract, according to Mills, is therefore the racial contract,
by which Enlightenment humanism determines
who qualifies as human. He then further extends
this argument to a critique of American pragmatism as, in effect, a form of racial liberalism,
which has unswervingly displaced the material and
social experience of the racialized (Mills, 2008).
In the neoliberal twenty-first century, the supermacy of the color-blind discourse is a continuance
of such displacement: it is not that racism has disappeared, but that it is supposed to have outlasted
its usefulness as a category, to have outlived its
meanings, and to have lost its social purchase
(Goldberg, 2008; Mills, 2008). Sociologists
Michael Omi and Howard Winant (1994) had earlier historicized the rise of color-blind ideology
as part of the long neoconservative reaction to the
gains of civil rights movement within the USA,
which was also aided by liberals themselves,
including the policies of Bill Clinton. Goldberg
(1993, pp. 136–8) further exposed that the
neoliberal theory of rational choice would presume

147

Race and Discipline As an outcome of the
Enlightenment, the production of race as a discourse coincided with the production of new disciplines and with a finer taxonomy of disciplines.
Kant was one of the most famous occasional
anthropologists; in his various lectures and articles, especially those posthumously collected
as Physische Geographie (Physical Geography), he
presents racial categorization in terms of natural
history and inscribes values to races from different geographic and climate zones. While we
associate Kant with the early phase of the discipline of anthropology, discipline in these articles
refers to the disciplining of indigenous people.
In characterizing different kinds of black people,
for instance, he describes how “The Moors, like
all inhabitants of the hot zones have a thick skin;
when one disciplines them, one cannot hit with
sticks but rather whip with split canes, so that the
blood finds a way out and does not suppurate
under the skin” (Kant, 1995, p. 61). The description of a physical characteristic (thick skin) transitions quickly to how to discipline the bearer
of this skin, as if one implies the other naturally
or inevitably, indicating a consensus between
author and reader, a community to which both

belong. According to the author’s pseudoscience,
drawing blood is more considerate or even more
humane for this skin type, so one must whip with
sharp split canes. In one breath, Kant weds a
physical characteristic to colonial labor exploitation and the right way of doing it – how to whip
morally, so to speak. When Kant does justify this
“discipline,” he notes that the inhabitants in the
hottest zones of the world are so “exceptionally
lethargic” that “rule and force” are needed to
mitigate their laziness (Kant, 1995, p. 64). The
equivalences established between industriousness,
rationality, and virtue typical of Enlightenment
philosophy clearly operate here.
Kant the anthropologist was simultaneous with
Kant the philosopher, but in the former role he
has been judged to be not only “unsystematic and
incoherent” but also, rightly, “prejudicial to the
extreme.” This prejudice throws doubt on his
otherwise consistent championing of ethical universalism and cosmopolitan principles. When put
under the pressure of his anthropological thinking, Kant’s philosophical universalism becomes an
“intensely discriminatory code masquerading as
the universal good” (Harvey, 2001, pp. 210–11;
see also Eze, 1995; Bernasconi, 2001). Even
scholars who try to analyze Kant’s racism in
more complex ways cannot but admit the “undeniable ugliness of this aspect of his thought”
(Hedrick, 2008, p. 268). But this is not for want
of universalism in Kant’s anthropological work –
Kant founded his universalism on a belief in
monogenism and the indivisibility of the human
species, according to which differences arise not
among species but in the same (human) species;
hence differences are determined by geography and
climate. This is what Etienne Balibar (2008) calls
the anthropological paradigm that is in a state
of “decomposition.” Challenges from political
philosophy, sociology, and other disciplines supplanted anthropology as more able to deal with
the question of race in its varying social and
political realities. How to expose the dark underside of Enlightenment thinking and its offspring
while making them fulfill their promise of universal
humanism continues to be a challenge today,
a challenge that Franz Fanon also considered
worthy. A belief in a universal humanism where
“genuine communication” is possible and universal
freedom is achievable supported Fanon’s analysis
of the psychopathologies of colonialism (Fanon,

comparative racialization

that even racism is economically rational, the
choice one makes as a self-interested social actor.
Rational-choice theory may be the contemporary
mode of extreme utilitarianism, another offspring of classical liberalism and Enlightenment
thought (Palumbo-Liu, 2005).
The contemporary phase of globalization
throws up new racisms – what David Goldberg,
Michael Omi, Howard Winant, Etienne Balibar,
and many others have variously called “color-blind
racism,” “racism without races,” “raceless racism,”
or “racisms without racism.” In the case of
France, due to the legacy of Republican liberalism,
race has largely been disavowed as an analytic
and a social category, while realities of racial
inequality have been largely ignored. The postcivil rights American ideology of color-blindness
mimics the same disavowal under the sign of
neoliberalism. Globalization of racial thinking
since the colonial turn has led to this conjuncture of color-blind ideologies in different parts of
the world, constantly producing different forms
of disavowels to better manage changing historical realities of racialized peoples.

comparative racialization

148
2008, p. 206). His choice of disciplines in this
endeavor included psychoanalysis, philosophy,
and literature.
The disciplining of race was also at the foundation of the all of these three disciplines. Ranjana
Khana has critiqued the racialized construction
of the “dark continent,” Celia Brickman the primitivizing of the natives, and Jacques Derrida
the “apoliticism” and Eurocentrism of psychoanalysis. Others, like Edward Said, have analyzed
literature’s complicity with racial thinking, colonialism, and orientalism (Said, 1979, 1993). In
addition, photography, often in conjunction
with anthropology, was a prominent colonial
technology used to produce certain images of the
natives in order to better manage them (Poole,
1997), not unlike philosophy, history, law, education, and indeed most other disciplines as we
know them. Colonial racism and its modern day
variants were by all means a multidisciplinary
effort.
Knowing the embeddedness of these disciplines
within colonial ideology, the decolonial, postcolonial, or minority intellectual has perhaps
two choices. One choice is to express endless
anxiety over the racialization of thought through
an infinite critique of the derivative nature of disciplines and their theories. For a time, several postcolonial scholars made this choice, and some of
the most significant conceptual breakthroughs in
Anglophone postcolonial theory were arguably
in this vein. Anthropology as the colonial discipline par excellence has for the past decades
led a soul-searching critique of itself, with very
mixed results (Said, 2003). Fanon (2008, p. 197)
would have called these “reactional” rather than
“actional” measures. The other choice is Fanon’s:
he appropriates and synthesizes disciplines, especially psychoanalysis, with great confidence and
poise, as Du Bois did with sociology. When
scholars are so busy learning the disciplines that
they have no time left to unlearn them, the confident use, revision, and extension of psychoanalysis by Fanon and sociology by Du Bois offer
inspiring lessons on how to race these disciplines.
Max Weber considered Du Bois the “most
important sociological scholar in the Southern
states in America,” having noticed the centrality
of race in American reality during his visit there
in 1904, when he met with Du Bois (Nelson and
Gittleman, 1973, p. 312). With Fanon and Du Bois

as inspiration, comparative racialization as a
method is also an attempt to race the disciplines
by involving as many conversations from different
disciplinary locations as possible and by insisting
that these conversations be not an option but a
necessity. “Disciplinary boundaries allow counterevidence to belong to someone else’s story,”
Susan Buck-Morss wrote (2000, p. 822); to keep
the disciplines honest, we need, for instance, to
bring into critical dialogues the classic sociological work such as The Racial Formation in the
United States and the classic literary work such
as“Race,” Writing, and Difference.
The works of Fanon and Du Bois serve as
eloquent examples of how disciplines can be
raced to do the work of race studies, and how race
itself constitutes a kind of epistemology: it is a way
of living in the world and a way of looking at the
world. The racialized might have the epistemological privilege of the oppressed – they see racially
based oppression more clearly than others – but
the moment the entire society notices race and
shares in this epistemology is when race itself
has become theory. When Hegel was sensitized to
the slave revolts in Saint-Domingue and incorporated this awareness into his dialectic of lordship
and bondage, he was, for a flashing moment
in 1805–6, the truly universal humanist that he
could have been (Buck-Morss, 2000). This is the
Hegel of The Phenomenology of Mind (1807) that
Fanon admires; and while Hegel does not directly
mention the slave revolts, Fanon does so in the
last pages of Black Skin, White Masks (p. 201).
Fanon sees the flashing moment when Hegel
raced philosophy and seizes it to emphasize that
the “absolute reciprocity” (p. 191) at the basis
of the Hegelian dialectic is the foundation and
hope for a truly universal humanism. To use
race as theory or to race disciplines is then to
imagine a way of looking at the world from such
genuinely reciprocal perspectives, which is, ultimately, an ethical practice of comparison.

`competence
A term introduced into linguistics by Noam Chomsky (1965, p. 3) to refer
to the knowledge that a native speaker has of
a language. The term was contrasted with performance, the actual use of language in concrete
situations.
The distinction between competence and
performance has been bitterly criticized, but the
criticisms are groundless, since the distinction
underlies virtually all work in linguistics,
Chomskyan or otherwise.
Recent work such as Chomsky (1986) uses
other terms such as “System of knowledge” or
“l-language” instead of competence. A wider
notion of communicative competence, proposed by
Dell Hymes (1972), has been influential in
applied linguistics.

`condensation/displacement
Essential aspects
of the workings of unconscious processes, and
especially of symptoms and the Dream-work, as
analyzed by Freud (1900). Thanks to the mechanism of condensation, a single unconscious
idea can express the content of several chains of
association; the mechanism comes into play at the
nodal point at which they intersect. Condensation explains the apparently laconic nature of
the Manifest content of the dream, as compared
with the richness of the Latent Content. The
term displacement refers to the process whereby
the emphasis or intensity of an unconscious idea
is detached from that idea and transferred to a
second and less intense idea to which it is linked
by chains of association. The effect or emotional
charge attached to a highly sexualized idea may,
for instance, be displaced on to a more neutral
image or idea. In such cases displacement is an
effect of censorship.

by Lacan (1957), for whom the Unconscious is

`conjuring
The system of magic and medicine that forms part of the black folk religion of
vodun, which was practiced in black slave communities across the Diaspora and which continued to flourish well into the twentieth century.
Often regarded as a descendant of the African
priest or healer, the conjurer performed various
social functions for the black community, including fortune-telling, avenging wrongs, curing psychological and physical ailments, and interpreting
natural and supernatural Signs. A practice largely
discredited as superstitious in the West, conjuring
has been celebrated by numerous black writers as
a system of alternative folk knowledge that has

enabled an oppressed group to exercise psychological control over an unjust social environment.
The term “conjuring” has recently acquired an
increased metaphorical currency in black feminist
criticism, with the publication of Marjorie Pryse’s
essay, “Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, and the
‘ancient power’ of black women” (1985), which
claims that the black women’s fictional tradition
derives its unique literary authority from its
recovery of black folk cultural practices such as
conjuring.

`connotation/denotation
The denotation of a word is its literal meaning or “dictionary
definition.” Its connotations are the additional
meanings, such as implications or associations,
which it takes on when used in specific contexts.
The word “pig” denotes a particular kind of
animal, but if used as an insult it has a connotation of greediness.
The distinction took on a special role in
modern criticism, first in I.A. Richards and
C.K. Ogden’s The Meaning of Meaning (1923), and
later in New Criticism. More recent, poststructuralist criticism, by contrast, “contests the hierarchy of denotated and connotated” and refuses
to “privilege” denotation as the primary meaning
(Barthes, 1973).

`consumer culture
A rather loose term which began to be used by revisionist Marxists in the
1980s to signal their new approach to the
marketplace. They wanted to rethink consumers’
previously assumed “irrationality,” whether this
irrationality was defined in terms of Marx’s

151
however, to be more useful as a rhetorical than
an analytical device. To use the term was to
gesture slyly at one’s own joy in shopping (and
to signal one’s agreement that “Class” was a
limited concept); it was not, though, a concept that
was properly tested in research, and by the end
of the 1980s it seemed as dated an idea as an old
Levi’s 501 advertisement.

`content analysis
Content analysis was developed as a research tool by early sociologists
of the mass media, primarily for comparative
purposes – its first use seems to have been in pre1914 American studies of newspaper coverage of
foreign affairs. It is a quantitative methodology
which depends on two problematic assumptions:
first, that one can readily distinguish verbal (or
other) Signs in a Text from the reading “context”; second, that such content can be measured
“objectively” – that different readers faced with
the same text would “measure” the same content.
That said, media “content” may take a variety
of forms, and content analysis was influentially
used, for example, in Frankfurt school studies of American popular songs and magazines (see
Peatman and Lowenthal, 1942–3). While this
quantitative approach has been discredited (cultural theorists are now much more attuned to the
active and subjective interpretation of pop texts)
the underlying assumption about standardization
has not, and content analysis is still employed
in most arguments about media bias and media
effects (see, for example, the work of the Glasgow
University Media Group or the debate on television violence).

concept of commodity fetishism or in the psychoanalytically inflected approach of the Frankfurt
school. Consumption, in Martyn Lee’s words, was
still taken to be the moment when economic
activity and cultural practice combined, but it
was now argued (in the pages of the British
Communist Party magazine, Marxism Today, for
example) that as a cultural practice it could not
be understood as entirely determined either by
the circulation of capital or by individual psychopathology. Consuming is, rather, a social practice,
which has two theoretical implications. First,
consumer culture can only be understood by
reference to the institutions of consumption, to
shops and shopping malls, consumer magazines,
and advertisements. The pleasures of consumption are, in fact, social pleasures. This was particularly important for feminists, who could thus
rescue the woman’s activity of shopping – and
window shopping – from the condescension of cultural theorists, and for Subculture theorists, who
argued that consumption was the site on which
the “active” consumer transformed a commodity
into a Symbol of “resistance.” This related to the
second argument: as culture, consumption is a
symbolic practice; it has to be interpreted. Its aesthetic value is not, as Frankfurt scholars would have
it (see W.F. Haug, 1986) simply the effect of a
manipulative advertising industry, but also
depends on consumers’ ability to read and enjoy
aesthetic Signs. For consumer culture, the form,
the packaging, is as meaningful as the content,
what is packaged.
This argument reflected the influence of
Postmodernism and, in particular, Jean
Baudrillard’s critique of the Marxist theory of
use value, and marked, in political terms, a shift
of focus from the social relations of production
to the social relations of consumption. This is turn
reflected the impact of the New right on the
theoretical agenda. The implication of the term
“consumer culture” was the social identity articulated in the marketplace, in the organization
of taste, and not, as Marx had argued, in the workplace, in the organization of labor. “Consumer
culture” was thus an attempt to conceptualize
from the left the new social map being drawn by
advertisers and market researchers in terms of
demographics and “lifestyle.” People are what
they eat, and the critical task was to understand
consumption. “Consumer culture” turned out,

or the simultaneous assertion and negation of any
proposition; (ii) dialectical contradiction, variously conceived within the Hegelian and Marxist

(for example, between the forces and relations of

`counterculture
 A term developed in the 1960s
(see Roszak, 1970) to make sense of the spectacular new youth and student subcultures and,
in particular, the American hippie. The term,
as Musgrove (1974) points out, had two uses.
On the one hand, it described what Richard
Neville (1970) called “play power,” a set of ideas,
beliefs, and values that opposed the dominant
culture (which, in this context, meant capitalism,
protestantism, and militarism); counterculturalists valued the spiritual over the material,
hedonism over prudence, tolerance over prejudice.
“Counterculture” referred, on the other hand, to
a group of people, those people who because of
their different ideas refused to live in “straight”
society and “dropped out” of it. The counterculture thus described both new social practices – drug
use, “free” sex, nondirective education, etc. –
and the institutions that supported these practices
– communes, alternative newspapers and magazines, free schools, “underground” festivals, etc.
The counterculture is usually thought to have
dissolved in the 1970s, the victim of its own

`Critical Inquiry
 In 1974 Sheldon Sacks
founded Critical Inquiry, a quarterly publication
from the University of Chicago Press, and gave
it the subtitle: “a voice for reasoned inquiry into
significant creations of the human spirit.” Later
issues omit this subtitle, but the journal’s goal
remains the same; Critical Inquiry is a pluralistic
journal concerned with Critical theories of
vastly diverse range and origin. As the current
editor W.J.T. Mitchell wrote in 1982, Critical
Inquiry should not be considered “aimless eclecticism;” the journal blends its own brand of
pluralism in an attempt to provoke and mediate
arguments in numerous areas of critical thought.
Mitchell labels the practice “dialectical pluralism,”
which “insists on pushing divergent theories and
practices toward confrontation and dialogue.”
The goal, by Mitchell’s admission, is idealistic and
never actually realized. In practice, however,
Critical Inquiry provides the next best alternative:
an intriguing sequence of debates among distinguished scholars. Its one downfall is that the
writing is often distractingly intellectual and
plagued with academic jargon.
Every issue contains essays by internationally known writers: Frank Kermode, Jacques
Derrida, Stanley Fish, and Michel Foucault
appear alongside M.H. Abrams, Donald
Davidson, and Catherine Stimpson. While the

critical theory In the strict sense, critical
theory is the interdisciplinary project announced
by Max Horkheimer and practiced by members
of the Frankfurt school and their successors,
whereby the Enlightenment ideal of a Civil
society might be achieved by bringing scientific
research to bear on Marx’s theory of social

change. In a looser sense, critical theory is now a
more general term, under which research projects
in the social sciences and/or humanities attempt
to bring truth and political engagement into
alignment. In both senses, critical theory is an
offspring of the Kantian tradition of thought
that prizes self-knowledge (see Kant and NeoKantianism).
The most useful, succinct elaboration of these
definitions of critical theory has been proposed
by Raymond Geuss (1981, pp. 1–2):
1.

Critical theories have special standing as
guides for human action in that:
(a) they are aimed at producing enlightenment in the agents who hold them, i.e.
at enabling those agents to determine
what their true interests are;
(b) they are inherently emancipatory, i.e.
they free agents from a kind of coercion
which is at least partly self-imposed. . . .
2. Critical theories have cognitive content, i.e.
they are forms of knowledge.
3. Critical theories differ epistemologically in
essential ways from theories in the natural
sciences. Theories in natural science are
objectifying; critical theories are reflective.
Critical theory bravely, but perhaps quixotically,
persists in confronting a recurring chain of
skeptical epistemological questions: Do truth
and goodness relate to each other and if so how?
Do the fruits of knowledge embody a desire for
moral action or a temptation to ethical and legal
violation? If knowledge of the good does not
lead to the good, what good, then, is knowledge?
A tempting, facile escape from these perennial
questions is simply to bracket them and set them
aside by claiming that a particular research
project is not designed to deal with the ethical
and/or political implications of its results. However uncertain and tentative its achievements,
critical theory, nevertheless, gives the highest importance to self-criticism; to marking the ethical/
political position from which one works in order
that such a position can be available for examination by critical readers or other reflective
audiences; to the recognition that knowledge
constitutes power; and to the conviction that
the supposedly amoral and apolitical position
is also a position that requires critical reflection.

critical theory

editors of Critical Inquiry are always pleased to
discover unknown, younger contributors, ultimately the journal reflects the current work of its
elite contributors. In his 1982 piece on critical
inquiry and the state of criticism, Mitchell offers
a “confession:” “because we regard their work
as barometric, we sometimes print essays by
famous writers which do not come up to our normal standards.” In other words, in an attempt to
accurately convey the current scene of criticism,
the editors often print articles by well-known
writers, “even when we do not think that they are
up to much good.”
Critical Inquiry has responded to the evolution
of critical theory by devoting issues, either in
part or in full, to Psychoanalysis, feminism,
and the politics of interpretation (to name a few)
and by printing papers from conferences on
metaphor and narrative. Occasionally the editors
publish a group of articles under a common
heading; for example, Seamus Heaney and Joyce
Carol Oates have contributed to the “Artists on
Art” sections of separate issues. In 1986 Mitchell
added a section called “Books of Critical
Interest.” Perhaps the most interesting section of
the journal is one labeled “Critical Response,”
which appears in nearly every issue. Here writers
respond to previous articles, and the resulting
debates can span several issues. But dialogue
between critics is not restricted to this section.
One of the long-running debates began in the
Summer 1982 issue with Steven Knapp and
Walter Benn Michael’s article “Against theory”
and ended in March 1985 with a special section
(three articles) on “Pragmatism and literary
theory”; the entire dialog has been collected and
published in a book, Against Theory: Literary
Studies and the New Pragmatism.
Now part its twentieth anniversary, Critical
Inquiry continues its distinguished reputation
for its attention to critical thought.

`cultural anthropology
 Although the following generalization will be modified further on, at
the outset one can say that cultural anthropology
is that branch of anthropology devoted to the study
of Culture. What is culture? Although there
are legions of definitions (as a beginning, see
Kroeber and Kluckhohn, 1950), culture is what
makes, for example, Navajos similar to each
other and different from Cherokees. We humans
are not the only species that engages in cultural
behavior, but ours is the only species that has come
to depend on culture as the principal means by
which we adapt to our environment, get along with
each other, and survive.
All species other than humans base their adaptation on a genetic inheritance of programmed
behavior and capabilities. Although the human
capability for culture is also biologically founded,
humans pass down their lifeways – strategies for
collective survival – not through the genes, but
through teaching each new generation of children
the lifeway of parents. Is it important that humans
have chosen a system based on teaching rather than
genes for adaptation? Yes. Culture is the reason
why our single species occupies more niches – from
tundra to the tropics, the forest to the desert, the
mountains to the plains – than any other species.
(There is an exception to this: certain species, such
as fleas and body lice have made the human
body their habitat. Where we go, they go, so their
geographic distribution is as extensive as ours.)

155
pology, archaeology, and linguistics. In Europe
cultural anthropology comprises the direct field
study of living societies and the analysis of the data
gathered in those field studies. There it is usually
called “social anthropology” and maintains little
contact with the other subfields, seeing itself as
more akin to sociology. In the United States,
however, four-field collaboration achieved a
kind of orthodoxy that dominated the enterprise
until about 1960 and still enjoys substantial
loyalty today.
The specific subject matter of cultural anthropology seems to be as diverse as human behavior
and interest. Specialized groups, often with their
own publications and computer networks, cover
such widely focused cultural domains as kinship,
Education, medicine, psychological issues,
economics, work, Ecology, language, feminist
studies, innumerable regional and cultural zones,
computers, tourism, migration, herding societies, fishing societies, human rights, indigenous
knowledge, and on and on. There is too a family
of efforts focused on how indigenous societies
classify and organize domains of knowledge,
such as botanical resources (“ethnobotany”),
medicinal remedies (“ethnomedicine”), and
astronomical phenomena (“ethnoastronomy”).
Cultural Anthropology as a Science Cultural
anthropology has, since the time of Boas,
understood itself as a would-be science. Thus the
stated goals of cultural anthropologists were to
gather and rely on primary data collected in a
rigorous and system-atic manner, to test hypotheses against the data, to assume that cultural
behavior was the product of discoverable cause
and effect relationships, and to seek reliable,
nonobvious predictions about culture. Yet a
fully scientific study of culture has never been
achieved. Mainly this is due to the intangible
nature of culture, the ethical framework that
constrains experimentation with a people’s lives,
and the fact that cultures are, to a significant
degree, one of a kind.
Further realities constrain the goal as a science.
Field research in cultural anthropology relies heavily on what can be called “the rapport bridge.”
Quality data on much of culture has to come from
the people who practice it. That information is
only made available when trusting relationships
exist between them and the ethnographer.

cultural anthropology

The reason why the same species that lives in
sweltering heat can also live in subzero climates
is that humans in cold climates have cultures
that teach them how to make warm clothes and
tightly sealed, well-insulated houses. Simply put,
culture has been, for humans, an adaptational
breakthrough of unparalleled magnitude. It is the
most successful means of biological adaptation the
earth has ever witnessed; it is why humans put
other species in zoos, aquaria, and conservatories
and not the other way around.
The basis of cultural anthropolgy is a question
that has very likely intrigued every human
society, past and present: why do peoples behave
differently from one group to another? To the
observing group, the cultural ways of alien
peoples look at least strange, and perhaps illogical, perhaps primitive, perhaps morally wrong.
In the mid-nineteenth century the confluence of
Positivism, the spreading belief that the natural
world is the product of orderly, discoverable
forces, and the emergence of systematic investigative methods became the preconditions on
which an anthropology could be invented.
In order to answer this question (why do
peoples behave differently) a concept was needed
which could serve as a tool for thinking about these
behavioral differences. The concept was culture,
which came together in a workable form around
1860 (see Lowie, 1937). Three critical aspects of
culture were identified: (i) that culture was manifested in behaviors – customs – that are patterned
and shared, (ii) that cultural behaviors are learned
from society, not biologically inherited, and (iii)
that cultural behaviors are arranged into what E.B.
Tylor called “a complex whole.” A fourth feature,
adopted more slowly, is that culture consists of
“shared ideas”; thus, behaviors and artifacts are
not culture themselves, but are reflections and
products of those shared ideas. Cultural anthropology emerged as the enterprise for studying
culture, conducted by professionals who identify
themselves and each other as anthropologists,
who maintain ways to communicate and debate,
and who are conversant with a common toolkit
of concepts, terms, and methods.
By 1900, especially under the influence of
Franz Boas, anthropology in the United States
had adopted the view that culture could be best
researched by approaching it within four general
subfields, only one of which was cultural anthro-

cultural anthropology

156
Usually this takes the form of mutual friendship.
In any other science, personal relationships interposed between investigator and data are anathema, casting doubt on the objectivity of the
data obtained. The “double-blind” experimental
technique that is insisted upon in much research
physiology and psychology illustrates the efforts
made to eliminate the personal linkage. In cultural anthropology, however, eliminating personal
relationships blocks access to the data.
Another unusual feature of cultural anthropology has been the conviction that a culture
can most thoroughly be understood when the
anthropologist sees the society not only as an
outside observer, but also from the “inside” –
through the world view of a native. These two
viewpoints are commonly referred to as the
“emic” (external) and “etic” (inside) systems. In
this author’s view, how one explains epistemologically the need for the emic view has always been
somewhat vague. Perhaps it is because most cultural behaviors make little sense until one know
the (emic) meaning to the participants. Just why
the chicken is killed is not very clear until one has
heard the people doing the killing, and, moreover,
understood the way in which the chicken and the
killing look within their larger scheme of things.
This seems to be true even when you conclude
that although people say the chicken dies to obey
the gods, you find it is because there are too
many chickens.
Thus the discipline’s claim to be a science is
compromised. Cultural anthropologists do not
design experiments, most field researches cannot
be replicated elsewhere, each culture as a unit
of study is substantially unique, one consciously
seeks to build a personal, value-laden relationship
between the investigator and the data, and the
emic, inside view is usually sought. Mostly these
divergences are necessary entailments for the
study of culture, but they also mean that cultural
anthropology’s claim to be a science falls somewhat short.
Nonscience Models Cultural anthropology’s selfimage as a science has, in recent decades, come
to be joined by alternative self-images. For
example, the humanist anthropologists have
argued that there is no way to be certain that the
anthropologist’s rendition of a culture depicts
something objectively real. Consequently the

humanists appear to argue that culture is better
experienced than analyzed. Sociobiology,
Materialism, Structuralism, feminism, and
other bounded frameworks also tend to modify
in their own ways an exclusively scientific model
of cultural anthropology.
The association of anthropology with the
humanities has always been important. The
study of cultural symbolism and its expression in
Ritual and Art has a lineage that moves from
Frazer’s Golden Bough to Lévi-Strauss’s Raw
and the Cooked, to Turner’s Anthropology of
Performance. The common ground with the
humanities lies not only with the narrative and
performance, but also with the essentially introspective mode of discovery that characterizes
much of both endeavors.
Another, newer variety of cultural anthropology responds to a widening change in the
anthropologist’s relationship to indigenous
societies, where much of the fieldwork is done.
With the flourishing of ethnic pride, these societies typically insist on having a deciding and
often managerial role in what information will
be gathered and what will be done with it.
Advancing a science of culture is not usually
high on their agenda. Cultural anthropologists
find that the indigenous society is now a full
partner in the venture. In these circumstances the
criterion for research is not theory testing, but its
usefulness to the host society. As a result, primary fieldwork among today’s indigenous societies
is increasingly a collaborative matter, and the old
division between “pure” and “applied” cultural
anthropology is no longer clear.
It is important not to leave the impression that
all cultural anthropology entails a field study of
an indigenous society. That is false. Particularly
since the 1930s, cultural anthropologists have
studied a steadily widening range of societies
and social groupings, including peasant villages,
towns, cities, factories, schools, hospitals, work
groups, impoverished urbanites, comfortable suburbanites, and countless others. On the whole,
groups remain as accessible as ever. Thus cultural
theory testing will have ample research sites,
though interpretation is more difficult when
only a part of a larger culture is in view.
In addition, a major part of cultural anthropology’s work does not depend on new field data.
Much analysis is done using cultural examples

157

Findings Those seeking to look at specific
findings and questions being pursued by cultural
and other types of anthropologists may find the
well-indexed Annual Review of Anthropology,
now in its twenty-third year, a rewarding place
to start. Periodicals, such as the British journal,
Man, the French journal, L’Homme, the Swiss journal, Anthropos, the Mexican journal, America
Indigena, and the American journals, American
Anthropologist and American Ethnologist, will be
found to be sources of current cultural research
and debate, and entry-points to the vastly larger
intellectual endeavor called cultural anthropology.
After some 130 years of professional work,
anthropologists have found that the cultural concept remains a central anchorage to the discipline.
The working definitions of culture continue to
be diverse and not always mutually compatible,
reflecting the intrinsic difficulty which human
social behavior poses for those who would explain
and predict it. Some anthropologists eschew the
concept altogether. Yet the question that founded
the discipline (why do peoples behave differently?)
remains as relevant today as it did in the discipline’s infancy, and culture remains the most
productive concept for answering it. Beyond that
question, culture is important in its own right: it
remains the singular attribute that has accorded
our species an unrivaled success among the
earth’s biological populace. Culture also presents
us with unique dangers, giving our species the
capability to destroy each other at genocidal
levels, to inflict cruelty with satisfaction, and to
limit the life chances of vast numbers of our
fellow humans. Culture remains arguably the
most important aspect for us to know more
about. Central to that investigation is cultural
anthropology.

cultural landscape in a globalizing world
The cultural landscape is the geographic unit of
human experience. For the human actor it is
the locus of shared geographic experience. For the
scholarly observer it is a way to conceptualize
the spaces of human productive, symbolic, and
social activity. Cultural landscape studies bring
space and environment into cultural discourses
where they have often been missing. In particular, the cultural landscape is a powerful way to
show the effects of globalization upon the environment in their cultural context.
Cultural Landscape The cultural landscape is
the world as human groups have altered it by their
activities and for their goals. The cultural landscape delimits individual humans’ interactions
with the world. The cultural landscape displays
three complementary aspects. It is an altered
natural system – how human cultures have
adapted the environment, as the cultures adapted
to the environment. It is also a set of physical
constructions, the infrastructural machinery that
supports human lives. And the cultural landscape is a symbol system, a series of messages
encoded, consciously or not, into the artifacts of
the built environment.
As an altered natural system, the cultural
landscape demonstrates the ways in which environmental practices are culturally determined.
This aspect of the cultural landscape developed
from the ideas of Carl Sauer as he sought to
understand the range of human adaptations to
the natural environment in the New World over
the millennia. Natural landscapes are modified
in different ways by different groups, which is
an important fact about the cultures and also
about landscapes. The expression on the physical landscape of a particular subsistence or
extraction system is a cultural artifact, just as the

cultural landscape in a globalizing world

already in hand. Over the past 130 years anthropologists have documented to a large extent perhaps 3,000 cultural cases whose information lies
in library volumes, data bases, and other sorts of
reports. The analysis of cultural principles using
multiple cases simultaneously is called ethnology,
and given the accumulation of cultural data
already in hand, ethnology would have a long
future even were no further data gathered.

cultural landscape in a globalizing world

158
manifestations of ritual, kinship, or exchange
are cultural artifacts. For example, the Balinese
communal peasant rice farming system differs
significantly in scale, form, and structure from
expansive Argentine cattle ranching, or from
industrialized vegetable production in California.
The differences reflect fundamental aspects of
the cultures in which the practices are embedded,
differences in higher-level values about harmony
and stability, the value of labor, obligations to the
non-human world, and landscape aesthetics.
And the different extraction practices have fundamentally different levels and types of impact
on the natural world. Environmental impact is
a direct manifestation of cultural practice in the
landscape.
Seen as an instrumental component of the built
environment, the cultural landscape describes
the practical machinery of the world that supports
the culture. This approach lies within the concerns
of urban studies, landscape architecture, and
much of historical geography. J.B. Jackson and Jane
Jacobs were pioneers of this view of the world,
describing the instrumentality of the landscape
in the ways that the constructed world provides
a people a living, creates livable spaces, or offers
impediments to the lives of its inhabitants. The
subject of such study is often finally economic
activity, but the strength of the cultural landscape
approach lies in the emphasis on the human
scale, the scale of a person moving though the
world. The contours of the cultural landscape
shape people’s ordinary behavior in space, and thus
provide the observer with a blueprint of that
behavior.
The third perspective, landscape as symbol,
emphasizes the culture in cultural landscapes.
This approach seeks to harvest meaning from
the world by explicitly regarding the landscape
as a series of cultural messages written in human
spatial activity. Study of the cultural landscape
extracts meaning from, or imposes meaning on,
a wide range of human constructions – a town
plan, a house type, a shrine, a business district.
The landscape is seen to have the characteristics
of a text: a set of individually meaningful objects
arranged into patterns that add more layers of
meaning. Cultural landscapes offer diverse ranges
of meaning. Some messages are explicit –
monuments, literal signs, or overtly sacred and
ceremonial spaces. Other messages are more

subtle – the nuance of an architectural style, the
rhetoric of fences, or the ideological hierarchy in
the arrangement of monuments within a park.
In fact, all landscapes should be thought of as
symbolic. Even the most utilitarian object – a
parking lot, perhaps – symbolizes its own functions and the cultural values supported by those
functions. This symbolic approach to cultural
landscape has strong affinities with cultural studies, and with the study of cultures. It is supported
in the writings of Yi-Fu Tuan, Dennis Cosgrove,
and others within humanistic geography.
Globalization Throughout most of the world
cultural landscapes have been undergoing changes
of unprecedented magnitude and rapidity. The
word “globalization” summarizes the major
processes underlying these changes. In brief, the
situation is that globalization removes barriers
between parts of the world, but those barriers were
what supported the diversity and robustness that
define the cultural landscape for its owners. Thus
the utility of the landscapes is degraded.
Globalization is a set of economic and cultural
processes that increase the movement of material
and ideas between distant parts of the world.
Globalization accounts for a number of social
impacts, including increasingly centralized decisions about economic activities, a concomitant
decrease in the power and well-being of smaller
economic actors, and a growing cultural hegemony
caused by the wide dissemination of a small
range of political and commercial ideologies.
The economic aspects of globalization are
easiest to quantify. International trade rates have
increased throughout the past several centuries,
primarily under the influence of capitalism and
proto-capitalism from the West. Over recent
decades, firms’ continual efforts to obtain new
markets, new resource pools, and new supplies
of pliant labor have met willing support from
states, and international barriers to trade have been
lowered through the abolition of tariffs and improvements in externally oriented transportation
facilities. The effects are familiar: capital flight,
closed plants, and unemployment in wealthy
countries; and rising foreign debt, falling economic
well-being, and erosion of labor and environmental standards in poor countries.
The cultural components of globalization follow
the economic. The power of corporations often

Globalization and the Cultural Landscape
Erosion of the cultural landscape is a central
effect of globalization upon individual humans.
The cultural landscape is degrading more rapidly
each year, in more different ways, over more
of the world than ever before. We use different
names for the parts of the changes, matching the
three aspects of the cultural landscape. Pollution
and land degradation describe the changes in the
human environment; sprawl and urbanization are
ways to describe the changes in the built world;
and cultural hegemonization describes the evolution of the symbolic landscape. These changes
in the cultural landscape have a shared origin,
which is the elimination of barriers to the movement of products, people, ideas, and organisms.
The character of the landscape is defined by its
boundaries. Over earth history, landscape complexity has been possible because landscape components developed in isolation from each other.
Spatial barriers account for the fundamental
nature of the human landscape as a diverse and
constructively chaotic mosaic. Barriers separate
one landscape’s diseases, cultural influences,
economic control, threatening organisms, and
pollution from other landscapes. Isolation has
been a critical creative factor in shaping the
world around us. Removing the barriers between

parts of the world – speeding the flow of ideas and
products – also permanently degrades the cultural
landscape.
Isolation is what creates diversity. Environmentally, barriers and isolation nurtured the
near infinite landscape mosaic of habitats and
topographies that is the natural world. Species
evolve to create diverse ecosystems when they are
separated from each other. This is illustrated
most famously by the diversification of Darwin’s
finch species on the several Galapagos Islands,
separated from each other by reaches of ocean.
Economically valuable resources of the physical
world can exist only as isolated reservoirs, in the
few places where natural barriers have resisted
the universal trend toward homogenization that
physicists call entropy. Cultures differentiate
when the people are isolated, creating diverse
cultural landscapes, and they meld when they
are joined. The ancient languages of western
Europe differentiated in isolation during the
Neolithic and the Bronze Age; many of those
languages disappeared when much of Europe was
linguistically unified by the Romans, whose army
and roads leveled the barriers on the land. When
Roman authority fell and barriers returned, language complexity also returned in the differentiated
set of Latin-derived Romance languages.
Diversity and stability are crucial to the
functions of the cultural landscape. As an environmental phenomenon, the cultural landscape
represents a specific cultural adaptation within
a particular habitat towards a particular set of
cultural values; there is no conceivable universal
solution to environmental adaptation. As an economic tool, the cultural landscape is a particular
way to provide value, as value is perceived by
the members of one culture. As a symbol system,
a given cultural landscape supplies the daily
stability of an understandable world, as it is
interpreted by one cultural group. The cultural
landscape is the scale at which humans experience the world, but it is also the scale at which
humans experience the degradation of their
worlds through globalization. And the contemporary cultural landscape has been thoroughly and
permanently degraded by the loss of barriers
between its parts.
Environmental effects of globalization are well
described, but they are typically seen as a sideeffect of the economic effectiveness of wealthy

cultural landscape in a globalizing world

exceeds the influence of other cultural actors,
and even governments. Cultural hegemony grows
with the intrusion of Western entertainment,
commercial messages, economic ideology, and
social values, which overwhelm local ones. Disney,
McDonald’s, and Coca-Cola are often named as
villains in this regard, but the cultural influences
of globalization are more numerous and more
subtle.
The economic results of globalization have
lifted billions of people out of poverty. The trade
machinery of globalization has distributed medicines and technology that have saved millions
of lives and relieved suffering for billions more.
Political ideas spread by globalization have encouraged millions to challenge oppressive governments and permitted large populations to attain
political autonomy unheard of through most of
world history. And the landscape-scale impacts
of globalization have been more destructive of
human culture and the natural environment
than any other sequence of events in history.

consumers in overexploiting unseen, distant
environments. Instead, much of the cause of
the negative effects of globalization on the
environment is simply globalization. Interaction
between parts of the world is, in itself, one of the
most significant environmental agents at work,
altering the natural world by eliminating the
divisions that had prevented the flow of damaging agents out across the land. Without barriers
the diversity of the environmental system starts
to compress. Essentially all large-scale humaninduced environmental challenges are caused by
breakdown of the barriers between parts of the
landscape. An example of the serious damage
humans create by removing barriers is the
introduction of invasive exotic organisms into new
environments where they eat or outcompete
pre-existing species that lack resistance to them.
Exotic organisms are the most permanent single
anthropogenic change in the biosphere. While
global warming may linger for a thousand years,
and nuclear wastes might be dangerous for
100,000 years, the European rabbits introduced
into Australia should remain there in some form
for millions of years – forever, in ecological
terms. The effects of exotics is greatest for those
with the least previous interaction – those for
whom the barriers had been strongest – so island
species are most threatened, with roughly half the
avian diversity of Hawaii gone already. Many of
the “emerging diseases” that have become serious
threats to significant parts of the world, like
Ebola virus, SARS, HIV, and West Nile virus,
had been endemic in small areas for centuries with
no effect beyond that locale. The breakdown of
geographic barriers by travel – and of interspecies barriers in zoos, pet shops, and farms to
let the pathogens out of their animal reservoirs –
permitted the diseases to become widespread
human problems. The great epidemic diseases of
early modern times – plague, cholera, syphilis,
smallpox, influenza – represented similar barrier
breaches, the escape of pathogens from spatially
constrained landscapes.
The whole suite of global geochemical effects
on the environment, of which anthropogenic
global warming is the most dramatic, represent
the breaching of natural barriers. Global warming is mostly a product of fossil fuel consumption, the rapid extraction of geological carbon
reserves from the isolated pools they had lain in.

Biological carbon reserves released by plowing
and by burning vegetation, and methane pools
released by disturbing wetlands, add to the problem. The list of environmental problems that
are essentially barrier breaches is long. Natural
vegetation is removed because it is a barrier to use
of the environment. As vegetation is removed
other flows expand. Rapid surface runoff of rain
depletes the natural reservoir of groundwater,
erodes the soil, and floods valleys. Now humans
must invest in their own barriers – dams and
floodwalls – to replace the natural protection
and to offset the lost natural storage.
Some of the greatest losses to humanity from
globalization are cultural, the absorption of the
traditional lifeways of local cultural units into more
dominant regional and global cultures, at the cost
of lost wisdom, lost modes of expression and discourse, and lost adaptations to nature, to society,
and to the supernatural. The Americas had hundreds of peoples and languages when Columbus
arrived, and many of them disappeared before
they were even seen by Europeans. The diseases
that Europeans brought across the oceanic barrier killed more native peoples than weapons
ever did, and killed them hundreds of miles
away from the European settlements. The universalizing religions – Confucianism, Islam, and
Christianity – displaced local spiritual diversity
from much of the world over the past two thousand years. Television and other mass media are
now displacing local narrative, music, and performance traditions throughout the developing
world, as they did in the developed world two generations ago. The human impacts are the loss of
familiar modes of interacting, loss of local values,
loss of traditional valuations of the individual, loss
of ways to understand the exact world those
people lived in, as well as displacement of discourses that might solve problems we all have.
The End of Globalization There is an end to
globalization, because it is inherently unsustainable. It is like a pyramid scheme, predicated on a
false model of ever-expanding pools of resources
to consume, endless supplies of human power
asymmetries, and infinite new populations to
exploit. The millennia-long processes of consolidation that drove globalization have fed on ever
larger reservoirs of value. Where once a bank of
clay could support a pottery industry integrated

161
Europe. But the inevitably parochial and muted
voices that support local action face, perhaps,
an insurmountable challenge to being heard
over the global, commercial rhetoric espousing
efficiency as an ultimate goal. The expanding
valuation of cultural landscapes is reliant on a more
nuanced understanding of human lives than
the commercialized mass media generally support.
But the outcome of this conflict over landscape
scale may have a fundamental impact on the
future of humanity.
For now, most barriers are getting lower,
and this is consuming the natural, material, and
symbolic diversity in the world’s landscapes. The
central crisis creating the cultural and environmental costs of globalization lies in the conflict
between the crudely economic “good” of trade and
interaction and movement, as compared to the
subtle human value of cultural and environmental stability that is supported by isolating the
local components of the world. Humans continue to unthinkingly forgo the permanent
advantage of a diverse cultural landscape for the
immediate benefits of rapid interchange.

`cultural materialism 
A critical approach
which developed in Britain during the late 1970s
and 1980s, cultural materialism is difficult to pin
down as a theoretical and analytical concept.
This is partly because it is often used in a polemical or descriptive rather than conceptual
way. There is clearly a link between “cultural,”
“dialectical,” and “historical” materialism, and

cultural materialism

into a particular local landscape and production
tradition, now excavations the size of national
parks are needed to feed global markets. Where
once a village was the labor supply to a local industry making a distinctly local product, now a factory complex employs a city’s worth of people to
make products designed half a world away for
a lifestyle alien to the workers.
But someday there will be no “bigger” to grow
to. Someday the largest will have been consumed, and the newest horizon will be old, just
as someday the capacity of the air and water to
support human life may be depleted, as well.
Then globalization must end, for better or
worse. Until that dismal time, it is very likely
that the present trends will continue, as will the
ongoing cultural homogenization and environmental degradation of the landscape. Humans will
continue to revel in the benefits of the shrinking world around them, and thus continue to
overlook the connection of globalization to their
evolving problems.
The globalizing forces that have been
unleashed so far – the flows of ideas, diseases,
chemical pollutants, weapons, crops, exotic
species, resources, and greenhouse gases – are
far from through working their effects. It will be
centuries before even the forces at work now will
equilibrate with the cultural landscape and stop
driving more changes. At a more indirect level,
the loss of diversity that globalization has
brought to ecosystems, cultural units, and economic structures will decrease the capacity of
those systems to respond to future stresses, thus
making the effects of globalization increasingly
worse. A threshold has been passed and the
problems accelerate.
Hope remains. A wisdom is emerging that may
help – a growing public awareness that spatial
isolation and protection may be beneficial. This
awareness is, in part, a natural affirmative reaction to the familiarity and reliability of the
known, the particular. The emerging academic
importance of place now reinforces the “local” in
numerous disciplines, including literature, sociology, and history. Local food, local exchange, and
local autonomy are newly rediscovered as basic
human values. The writings of Wendell Berry
and Michael Pollan, for example, support a
regional-based approach to food production in the
USA, parallel to the “slow food” movement of

cultural materialism

162
“cultural materialism” is allied to Marxism,
although often implicitly rather than explicitly.
It is also hard to define because the concept itself
depends on both the tension between and the
breakdown of its constituent terms – “culture”
and “materialism,” or rather, material forces – in
ways which change the meanings of both. Thus
the concept is materialist in that it suggests that
cultural artifacts, institutions, and practices are in
some sense determined by “material” processes;
culturalist in its insistence that there is no crude
material reality beyond culture – that culture is
itself a material practice. To a certain extent,
then, cultural materialism hangs on a Paradox:
culture is itself material, yet there is always a further, shadowy, material reality that lies beyond it,
and from which it derives its meaning. In this way
cultural materialism runs the risk of mimicking
the very idealism it seeks to repudiate. Moreover,
as Raymond Williams pointed out in “Problems of materialism” (repr. in Williams, 1980),
“materialism” is itself an implicitly metaphysical
abstraction, and the concept of “the material” itself
is constantly shifting. In its repudiation of mysticism and idealism, materialism has tended to
be connected with radical political projects, but
it is not inherently radical and there are clearly
dangers in linking “frozen material laws” with
particular political strategies.
Cultural materialism was first developed as
a description of his own method as much as a
critical term by Raymond Williams, who clearly
placed his work within a Marxist political and intellectual tradition in his later writings, although
wishing to avoid the rigid and formulaic concepts of materialism mentioned above. Cultural
materialism develops out of historical materialism,
but, like other critiques of “classic” Marxism,
is critical of its economic determinism, and in
particular of the hierarchical division between
“Base” and “Superstructure,” whereby political institutions, cultural forms, and social practices are seen as reflecting and being ultimately
governed by economic forces and relationships.
In his essay “Base and superstructure in Marxist
cultural theory” (repr. in Williams, 1980),
Williams emphasized the need to see the “base”
as much as the “superstructure” as a process
embodying different kinds of relationships
rather than as an unchanging structure. He
stressed the importance of developing a theory of

power and Ideology that can encompass a
range of forms of production and reproduction.
Why, he suggests, should the pianist be seen as
less productive than the piano maker?
Cultural materialism maintains that any theory
of culture (not only Marxist) that presumes a distinction between “art” and “society” or “literature”
and “background” is denying that culture – its
methods of production, its forms, institutions, and
kinds of consumption – is central to society.
Cultural forms should never be seen as isolated
texts but as embedded within the historical and
material relationships and processes which
formed them, and within which they play an
essential part. Williams’s argument, that means
of communication are themselves means of production rather than subordinate to some more
“real” primary process, is crucial to this analysis.
Human communication (whether it be “natural”
forms such as speech, song, dance, drama, or the
technological media) is itself socially productive
as much as reproductive; moreover, it parallels
other kinds of productive processes. These technologies of cultural production play a crucial
part in shaping cultural forms and institutions,
but do not determine them. A more nuanced and
intricate theory of power is necessary to understand the ways in which dominant meanings
and identities are produced, by state institutions,
religious beliefs, education, and the media,
and how they are contested or assimilated by
subordinate and appositional groups. Williams
developed his analysis of both the selective tradition and Dominant, residual, and emergent
cultures to encompass this.
Cultural materialist analysis developing from
Williams’s work has tended to elaborate the
latter aspects of his theories, and to emphasize
processes of institutional cultural power in the
shaping of identities rather than focusing on
material production in the narrower sense,
drawing on Althusser’s theory of Ideology,
Gramsci’s conception of Hegemony, and
Foucault’s definition of power. It has, moreover,
tended to move again toward interpretation of
specific Texts, concentrating on the role they play
in forming an English literary tradition and a dominant English national identity. This is partly
because of the institutional conditions within
which this work is taking place – within English
literature departments of universities. Cultural

Although many of the most explicit examples
of cultural materialist criticism have been in
Renaissance studies, there is also a substantial
body of work on eighteenth and nineteenthcentury writing which develops a much longer
history of Marxist and materialist criticism of
the novel: the work of Georg Lukács, Ralph
Fox, and Arnold Kettle, as well as Raymond
Williams and contemporary literary theory. Ian
Watt’s important work on the rise of the novel
has been developed by critics such as Michael
McKeon and Terry Lovell, while John Goode
and Peter Widdowson have analyzed the ways in
which Thomas Hardy and George Gissing were
both situated in and contesting late nineteenthcentury ideologies and forms of Literary production. Feminist criticism, too, has taken
up and expanded Virginia Woolf’s argument in
A Room of One’s Own (1926) that it is material
conditions which enable women to write, and that
the development of the novel is dependent on this
gendered material and ideological possibilities
and constraints.

`cultural studies 
A diverse body of work from
different locations concerned with the critical
analysis of cultural forms and processes in contemporary and near-contemporary societies.
There is no stable or single version of “cultural
studies,” any more than there is of “English”
or the other familiar self-proclaimed academic
“subjects.” Instead the provenance and purposes
of work in cultural studies have in important
ways been various and context-specific. Currently,
work is being initiated and carried forward in

cultural studies

materialism has recently been self-consciously
developed in Britain to denote a more “political”
counterpoint to New historicism in the United
States, both tendencies focusing on Shakespeare
and the Renaissance. In fact there is a considerable degree of overlap between the two tendencies,
and although they have been developed in distinct
institutional conditions, it is artificial to draw
too firm a line between them. During the late 1980s
and early 1990s a spate of debates on “the
Shakespeare industry” appeared in British journals and more widely in the press, exploring
the role that “Shakespeare” played not as an
individual but as a cultural institution, continually
produced and reproduced from a Canonical
selective tradition as the centerpiece of the
English literary heritage and in the light of contemporary notions of political legitimacy. Critics
of this work complained that its account of
cultural power was too monolithic, that it did
not adequately address the contradictions in
Shakespeare, but saw his plays as the passive
bearers of the dominant ideology.
In fact most cultural materialist criticism has
stressed the ways in which Texts contain the
seeds of opposition to the dominant structures they
embody; they certainly do not see all canonical
texts as straightforwardly complicit with the
powers of the state, then or now. The analysis of
cultural power depends on acknowledging its
potency, its ability to speak to audiences in
different historical situations, though not in a
timeless way. Many of Shakespeare’s plays, particularly those set in historical and Roman times,
have been reframed in various specific situations
to legitimize the exercise of state violence. However this does not mean that the inherent meaning of all his work is to condone such violence
or that it cannot form a part of very different
agendas or inspire oppositional and alternative
meanings: the British trade union leader Tom
Mann was much given to quoting Henry V.
Indeed, as Jonathan Dollimore, Alan Sinfield,
Catherine Belsey, and Kathleen McCluskie have
maintained, the stress has increasingly been on the
subversive and dissident power of oppositional and
marginal groups to reread and remake texts,
shifting the emphasis from Writing and production in the original situation to reproduction
and reading and the ideological contexts in
which this takes place now.

cultural studies

164
disparate locations and academic circumstances
despite the increased visibility of work grouped
together as cultural studies in globalized academic publishing. Consequently any narrative of
the “development” of cultural studies (particularly
if it stresses founding “fathers” or places) tends
to be misleadingly overcoherent, though since
new ventures require myths of origins, references to, for example, a “Birmingham school”
have acquired their own momentum and significance. In fact, despite the plethora of such
narratives (which this version will not escape),
self-questioning about intellectual and political
purposes and appropriate academic (or extraacademic) locations for the work have been
among the few consistent features of analyses
now widely recognized for their intellectual
vitality and their questioning of existing frames
– even though the term “cultural studies” itself
was first used only in the 1960s. Of the various
attempts to regroup intellectual fields since then
(Women’s, black and peace Studies are other
examples), cultural studies, drawing on the
polysemy attached to “Culture” itself, has been
a notable survivor, attractive for many and perhaps contradictory reasons.
One set of circumstances for work later called
cultural studies arose in Britain and some other
countries during the 1950s and after. They included the personal experiences of various people
whose own lifetimes and education entailed
migrations across different cultural borders and
worlds; developments in postwar societies resulting in considerable cultural change and innovation;
and the inadequacy of existing academic disciplines
to take account of either. Little work was being
done on marked and visible cultural differences
which (despite predictions of “embourgoisement”) included class and regional differences, new
forms of Popular culture, youth cultures,
“Counterculture”; little either on the pervasive
newer forms of media, advertising, and music put
into circulation through the “cultural” or “consciousness” industries. Sociology in its prevailing
British and North American versions was typically
policy-led, quantitative and positivist. The study
of literatures and languages was engaged with
the close reading of particular Texts but little
with work outside the “Canon,” with what later
became known as “theory,” or with contemporary developments. Wider intellectual engagements

were unusual so that Marxism, for example, was
known only in easily devalued “economistic”
terms.
New intellectual interests were thus marked out
with difficulty. A generation of quite different
writers (compare for instance Barthes in France
with Hoggart in England) had to discover a
new way of working as they moved, unevenly and
in stages, away from the hostile and despairing
treatment of contemporary culture found in the
ahistorical work of American New criticism, in
the comprehensive but later embittered questioning of F.R. Leavis, or in the only partly known
and rigorously bleak work of the Frankfurt
school. Raymond Williams produced in a
variety of articles, books, and journalism wideranging analyses of culture and cultural history,
which were guardedly optimistic about new forms
of media, while making astute political connections from his position as a founder of the New
Left and self-described Welsh European socialist.
Richard Hoggart wrote about the threatened
strengths of working-class culture in Yorkshire
and established at Birmingham the Centre for
contemporary cultural studies, whose members, including Stuart Hall and many others,
began to publish on youth culture, media, education, and on theories and methods in the new
areas. By the 1980s much energy, in difficult conditions, had produced a body of material which
in Britain, and increasingly in some former
countries of the Commonwealth and the USA,
could be seen to have marked out a distinctive
space and way of working for cultural studies.
The phrase “culture is ordinary” used by
Williams in 1958 (see Gray and McGuigan,
1993) made a political claim against the exclusions
of “selective traditions” of culture. His writing
suggested that culture understood as meanings
in negotiation is found in all kinds of “texts,” across
different sites and institutions and throughout
everyday life. If Adorno and others had observed
the fractures between High and Popular culture (Schoenberg and Hollywood film as the
“torn halves of an integral freedom” to which they
did not add up), Williams recalled that culture
could mean cultivation and growth, and argued
for the democratic extension of culture as a
shared work and common space. The agenda set
for the study of culture thus became extremely
wide, challenging the restrictions implicit in the

165
and decisions. Close study of cultural forms went
alongside and contributed decisively to a larger
account of contemporary societies, informed by
social theories any by the perceptions of a political stance. Various forms of Marxism, with a particular stress on class divisions, the state, domination, and the workings of Ideology, underpinned much important work (for example, that
of Stuart Hall). However, since Marxism, though
concerned with struggle, typically did not
recognize a category of culture (beyond that of
class consciousness) the work of later Marxists,
Voloshinov for his theory of language, semiotic
struggle, and “multiaccentuality,” and Gramsci
for his account of Hegemony, have been highly
influential.
Later work from the women’s movement
delivered a critique of the gender-blindness of
Marxism, forcefully establishing the centrality of
Patriarchy and gender divisions within cultural
analysis (see, for example, Franklin et al., 1991).
By the 1980s, in both Britain and North America,
questions of racism and anti-racism, migration and
diaspora were also profoundly important politically and in the political analysis of culture
(CCCS, 1982). At present a heightened attention
to issues arising from globalization, reinforced
by Postmodernism, further extends an already
complex social analysis whose key terms (ideology, the state, gender, class, “race”) have to be both
thought and used alongside each other and carefully questioned.
Cultural forms have themselves been studied
within a giddying acceleration of theoretical and
“methodological” Paradigms. While some semiological work has seemed to remain text-bound
and perhaps spuriously scientific, it has drawn
attention to languages and procedures of representation. That meaning is constructed through
language is illuminated powerfully both in
work on discourse in critical linguistics and in
Foucault’s work on forms of knowledge and
power. Quite other dimensions of culture such
as subjectivity, fantasy, and sexuality have been
broached through the difficult terrain of psychoanalytic thought. Even so, there are other areas of
culture where an adequate language of analysis is
still to be found (for example, music) or where
work has hardly begun (for example, religion).
The characteristic object of cultural studies
is, however, neither a theoretical commentary

cultural studies

divisions of academic organization and knowledge
production. It also became contentious in both
questioning judgments of cultural quality and its
political engagement. By the end of the 1960s many
different political events and movements led to a
view of culture not as outside politics, nor as part
of an organic (Leavis) or functionalist (Parsons)
view of society, but as a site of conflict and struggle. Contemporary initiatives (for example, from
the black and women’s movements) in “cultural
politics” claimed political possibilities in cultural
activity in ways unrecognized by the labor movement and either the social democratic or communist left. Because cultural analysis would
include social and political dimensions, making
connections across academic boundaries, the
way was quickly opened for challenges offered by
rediscovered traditions of Marxist thought.
The impulses behind cultural analysis were
thus and have remained a mixture of the intellectual, the personal, and the political. Typical work
(for example, Williams, 1961; Hall et al., 1978;
Coward, 1984; Gilroy, 1987) was exploratory and
eclectic, addressing new objects of study and creating new kinds of analyses. While very different
sites of culture were examined (from working-class
or youth culture to political Discourses, from
the cultures of schools and workplaces to those
of shopping and consumerism, from versions of
the national culture to “Enterprise culture,”
from the cultural forms of Diaspora to those of
lesbian sexuality), their analysis has often been
explicitly committed, with distinctively personal, autobiographical, evaluative, and political
dimensions, rather than laying claim to canons of
science or objectivity. Studies have also unevenly
combined various drawings or raids upon disparate
bodies of theoretical work with a grounded,
concrete attention to particular cultural forms and
situations.
If any one theme can be distinguished in the
first phase of cultural studies, it is that of culture
as the site of negotiation, conflict, innovation, and
resistance within the social relations of societies
dominated by power and fractured by divisions
of Gender, Class, and “race.” Though specific
analyses gave different weight to moments of
domination or subordination, cultural forms and
processes were seen as dynamic forces and not
as secondary to or predictable from institutional
forms or political and economic organization

strengthened by cultural references nor a particular form of culture, but a cultural process or
moment, analyzed for particular purposes and
in a specific place and time. Culture is located
neither in texts, nor as the outcome of its production, nor only in the cultural resources,
appropriations, and innovations of lived everyday
worlds, but in different forms of sense making,
within various settings, in societies incessantly
marked by change and conflict. Culture is neither
institutions nor genres nor behavior but complex
interactions between all of these. It has been
the decisive contribution to cultural studies of
ethnographies, participant observation, interviewing, and the study of lived worlds to show,
for example, that however sophisticated may be
the cultural study of a text, a policy, an ideology,
or discourse, a form is used, reworked, and
transformed by different groups in ways unpredictable from formal analysis. This is true of
how media are taken up, selectively used, and
explained (see Encoding/Decoding), the ways
in which school pupils or a workforce construct
their experiences, the selective appropriations or
innovations which people make of discourses,
ideologies, and various cultural forms in their daily
lives. In this important area work has differed
in both approach and interpretation. There are
various kinds of subtle and theoretically informed
textual analysis, and other studies dealing with the
complexities and challenges of observation and
interviews. By either route, stress has been laid differently upon, say, the degree of closure brought
about through ideologies disseminated through
dominant forces of production or upon the
potentiality of spaces for creativity and resistance
(itself a problematic but important term in cultural studies work). The work of Willis, Radway,
and Fiske typifies a divergence of empirical focus,
the theoretical working of material, and in the
complex mix of resources brought to bear on what
is done and how it is written, including questions
about the intended audience or constituencies
for such work.
There issues are inextricably linked with the
locations in and from which cultural studies can
be carried out. The new work necessarily sustained
a critique of the “disciplines” whose limits brought
the exploration and innovation into being. If the
now professionalized disciplines of higher education valuably included a concentration upon

distinctive objects of knoweldge, core concepts and
productive ways of working, they also erected
hierarchies and boundaries. Issues may be first considered from a disciplinary background but their
pursuit may lead elsewhere. One model for this
work has been that of collaboration between
those trained in different disciplines, producing
(as in the Birmingham Centre) group work and
joint authorship which proved to be supportive,
valuable in its outcomes, and a challenge to the
competitive individualism of some parts of the
academy. Some of the best-known texts in this field
have resulted from joint work, and in future this
may include collaboration between teaching and
research staff and students working in different
parts of the world. There has also been some
debate and ambivalence about whether universities are the only or best place in which to pursue
cultural studies. Williams saw the work as rooted
in the adult education wing of the labor movement,
others have tried to develop networks, alliances,
and dialogs with other groups. While 30 years ago
academics were sometimes found commenting and
writing in the media, there has now been some
lessening of the possibilities in the West for
debates in a public sphere. All this forms part of
a contradiction, of which those working in cultural studies are aware, between the development
of a critical space, open as wide as possible, and
the necessity to work somewhere in the university while developing connections and dialogues
elsewhere as circumstances permit.
The characteristic divide between humanities
and social sciences is particularly obstructive to
cultural studies, which seeks to understand
meanings as they are made, exchanged, and
developed within wider social relations. Cultural
studies within literature departments, instead of
questioning the whole disciplinary formation,
run some danger of being appropriated within
schools of “theory” or, perversely, of being confined to “popular” and extracanonical Writing.
Opportunities seem to be wider in the study of
foreign cultures, or in area studies (including
American and Russian studies, while the British
Council appears to see cultural studies in Britain
as part of “British” studies) where the restrictions
of literature, language, and institutions may be
remapped in cultural studies. Meanwhile in the
social sciences it has always been clear that cultural
studies are wider and other than media studies,

167
and awareness of its implications, may serve to
decenter the West in cultural studies in the
future. Postmodernist Paradigms are active in cultural studies as everywhere else, but postcolonial
approaches may question them in significant
ways. There will be a more informed awareness
of international movements, cross-cultural issues,
cultural migrations, and hybridities. Characteristic models of cultural domination and subordination will need to become more complex,
and no longer exclude more mainstream cultural
forms – say the cultures of the suburbs. The
study of cultural policy and the application of
cultural studies to policy issues, or to take a different instance the cultural study of science or
religion, have scarcely begun.
The current situation is, as before, paradoxical.
“Cultural studies” has become a widely recognized
and referenced body of work, of interest to many
kinds of students but at times also outside education, characterized by a rich (and not yet
absorbed) diversity of approaches and interests
and also by a degree of (possibly cherished)
marginality. There are few working in this area
and with few resources. A space has been made,
with difficulty, for the registration of important
issues outside the existing educational agenda, but
the previous disciplines are changing (deceptively
fracturing) while cultural studies now has its own
languages and institutional presence, not always
conducive to participation in a wider and public
debate. Work in cultural studies is likely to
remain volatile, self-reflexive, and alert to new
questions, but may need now to help contribute
toward more of a common agenda with attached
priorities, across the specialist interests of the
humanities and social sciences, and to respond to
a new period in which the hegemony of the New
Right, and also of the West, is fast breaking up.

cultural studies

but there are important moves in both media and
communication studies towards a dialog with
more qualitative work in which media cannot be
separated from many other social and cultural
developments. Sociology too shows signs of
giving cultural issues greater weight, sometimes
confined to a subspecialism called “the sociology
of culture” and sometimes with greater or lesser
unease about the credentials of a newcomer.
Elsewhere cultural studies forms the basis for
analytical work and debates within such practicebased subjects as fine art, textiles, photography,
and music.
At one level all this is part of a debate about
whether cultural studies (and much other recent
work) are of necessity cross-disciplinary, interdisciplinary or (Clarke) “undisciplined,” or is
part of a shift into a “postdisciplinary” period in
academic work, perhaps linked to other postmodern developments. New convergences arise
with work in geography or critical linguistics.
Cultural studies in many parts of the world
offered a third way between empiricisms and
the abstractions of neo-Marxist (for example,
Habermas) and other forms of theory, and also
a space in which to deal with urgent contemporary and political questions running across existing divisions of intellectual labor. That space has
to be found and developed, although its location
and form will vary from one setting to another,
at times within (and questioning) a discipline,
at others a program across departments or a
shared arena with different memberships. These
are equally issues about the construction of a
course or curriculum in cultural studies, and ways
of working, learning, and teaching most appropriate to students bringing their own agendas
and for whom equally the personal, political,
and intellectual are present at once.
Thus there can be no single agenda or best place
for cultural studies if proper account is taken
of changing and also particular circumstances.
That is why work so far exemplifies Gramsci’s
comment on culture itself, that it represents
an infinity of traces without an inventory, given
the impact of divergent paradigms, formations, and
political movements and situations. However,
while this account has concentrated on the “First
World,” it seems likely that interests in cultural
studies from many other parts of the world, combined with the heightened speed of globalization

cultural theory

See Introduction

`culture
 A term of virtually limitless application, which initially may be understood to refer
to everything that is produced by human beings
as distinct from all that is a part of nature.
However, it has often been observed that since
nature is itself a human abstraction, it too has
a history, which in turn means that it is part of
culture. In his efforts to deal with the apparently
universal occurrence of incest prohibitions in
human societies, Claude Lévi-Strauss candidly
admits that the distinction between culture and
nature is an instance of theoretical Bricolage, in
the sense that the distinction is simultaneously
inadequate and indispensable. Two extreme
attempts to limit the meaning of the term can be
found in its technical use by North American
anthropologists to refer to the primary data of
anthropology, and in its honorific use, from the
seventeenth to the nineteenth century (for example,
by Matthew Arnold) to refer to the finest products of civilization. In a bold effort to avoid
these extremes, Clifford Geertz defines culture by
way of Semiotics as the “webs of significance”
spun by human beings (1973, p. 5). Yet even
such an open definition as this presupposes an

extraordinarily powerful (but perhaps justifiable)
role for the semiotic in human life.
Raymond Williams begins his famous essay on
“culture” by admitting that it is “one of the two
or three most complicated words in the English
language” (1988, p. 87). The complexity, however,
is not just a matter of the utility of a term or the
efficacy of a concept. For those who confront the
living reality of cultural conflict, the issue may be
one of having – or not having – oneself or one’s
relations recognized by another culture’s definition of the human. Homi Bhabha, accordingly,
concludes that “there can be no ethically or epistemologically commensurate subject of culture.”
If it is not possible to identify a transcendent
humanity that is not itself based on a particular
culture’s sense of value, then all that is left is what
Bhabha calls “culture’s archaic undecidability”
(1994, p. 135). If one ethnic or national group can
define another as nonhuman or subhuman, then
culture becomes suddenly and tribally specific
and exclusive. The definition itself is an act of
violence and an invitation to potential if not
actualized genocide. When one culture eliminates
what it considers not human, it identifies itself,
according to its own definition, as human.
Cultural identification in such a context takes on
ultimate power.
Although some of the initial violence of cultural
definition has been recognized as an instance of
Orientalism, or a Western effort to define and
specify Asian culture as the alien – or idealized –
other, more recent politically active efforts have
been exerted to draw cultural definitions within
what were once unified nation states in Eastern
Europe or Africa. Just as Nazi definitions of the
human required efforts to exclude Jews and just
as southern American definitions of humanity once
excluded blacks, so now in South Asia, Africa,
and elsewhere in the world cultural definitions are
instruments of the political power of identity
exclusion. To define “culture” is to define the
human; to be excluded from the definition can
have an ultimate cost.
Since the middle of the nineteenth century, culture has been subjected to a range of definitions
that extend from Arnold’s all-embracing sense of
the possibility of human perfection to Pierre
Bourdieu’s systems of symbolic violence. In
Culture and Anarchy (1869) Arnold thought of culture as a redemptive pursuit through a principally

`culture industries 
Culture industries can be
defined, simply enough, as those industries which
produce cultural goods. Or, to put it the other way
round:
Generally speaking, a cultural industry is held to
exist when cultural goods and services are produced and reproduced, stored and distributed on
industrial and commercial lines, that is to say on
a large scale and in accordance with a strategy
based on economic considerations rather than any
concern for cultural development. (UNESCO,
1982)

This definition applies both to cultural forms
which depend on “craft production” and “mass
reproduction” (as in the publishing industry and,
to some extent, the music business) and to media
which depend on large-scale capital investment and
collective technological production with an elaborate division of labor (such as the film and television industries). There is by now, indeed, a
large body of sociological and business studies
literature on “the production of culture,” studies
which examine in detail the industrial “valueadding” process through which songs, novels,
television programmes, films, etc. must these
days pass (see, for example, Peterson, 1976).
The use of the term “culture” in such descriptions means, however, that the analysis of the
culture industries is never, in fact, a simple
matter of economics or management theory. To
describe the film, music, publishing, or television
industries as culture industries (rather than as, say,
Entertainment industries) is to imply critical
questions about both their creative practices and
social effects.

culture industries

literary education of the best that human beings
had thought and said. In his view, culture in this
sense has the potential of harmoniously unifying all of human society. In part transmitted by
T.S. Eliot, this mission for literary culture has
been very influential in Britain and the United
States. Not surprisingly, the intellectual revolutions brought about by the thought of Charles
Darwin, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Friedrich
Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud have had profound effects on post-Arnoldian theories of culture. In a perverse version of Darwin’s theory
of evolution, the American anthropologist Lewis
Henry Morgan in 1877, despite his humanitarianism and efforts on behalf of native American
culture (See Native American studies), developed
a system for hierarchically classifying cultures
according to evolutionary stages. Other early
cultural evolutionists included Edward Burnett
Tylor (1832–1917), who founded the British
school of social anthropology. Engels too had an
evolutionary (or perhaps de-evolutionary) view
of culture, most clearly expressed in his Origin of
the Family, Private Property and the State, where
he sees the emergence of civilization as not only
magnifying previously existing systems of labor
but also creating the merchant class, “a class that
makes itself the indispensable intermediary
between any two producers and exploits them
both” (Marx and Engels, 1968, p. 548). While
suspicious of progressivist ideas and uses of history, Nietzsche (1983, p. 123) thought he saw “true
culture” emerging from a recovery of the “moral
nature” of the classical Greeks in repudiation
of the legacy of Rome. For Freud, especially in
Civilization and Its Discontents (1930), culture
provides not only a bulwark against nature but
also as such an unrelenting source of opposition
to instinct, which leads in turn to a continuous
discontent by human beings with that structure
of defense that they have created out of their always
divided subjectivity.

culture industries

170
The first systematic, analytic use of the term
“culture industry” can thus be found in the
Frankfurt school critique of mass culture (see,
for example, Horkheimer and Adorno, 1947
(1972) and Adorno, 1991). For Horkheimer
and his German colleagues, the point of the term
“culture industry” was its implication that the
Marxist critique of commodity production in
general could (and should) be applied to the
production of symbolic goods in particular, to the
production of goods whose “use value” was
aesthetic, diverting, and ideological. The culture
industries were thus like any other capitalist
industry: they used “alienated” labor; they pursued profit; they looked to technology – to
machinery – to provide a competitive edge; they
were primarily in the business of producing
“consumers.”
The implications of this approach to mass culture are familiar: the mode of cultural production
determines cultural value; the formal qualities of
mass cultural goods are an effect of production
techniques and the management of competition;
the “pleasures” of mass culture are essentially
irrational, the effect of the efficient commercial
manipulation of desire. Ironically, the first
argument (given a Romantic gloss) became
commonplace within the cultural industries
themselves, where a distinction came to be made
between cultural goods produced for “commercial” and “artistic” reasons (this was the basis of
the late 1960s distinction between “rock” and
“pop” music, for example). And if, in practice,
it is difficult to find any form of contemporary
culture that is not, somewhere along the line,
implicated in the process of industrial production
(even Schoenberg’s music is primarily heard on
record), the Frankfurt argument was now turned
on its head: to assign a cultural commodity
aesthetic value is to imply that it is, somehow, produced “autonomously” (for “artistic purposes”).
And this is, in turn, indicated by its challenge
to or denial of the usual technical conventions
and sales formulas of mass cultural production.
It is claimed, in other words, that some goods
(some films, some records, some books) really
are different, individual, or unique; this is not
just the appearance of “difference” within that
standardization of the mass cultural product which
was, for Adorno, the essence of the industrial process. The distinction can then be drawn, similarly,

between serious appreciation (of the songs of
Bob Dylan, the films of Martin Scorsese, the
books of Stephen King) and mindless consumption (of Kylie Minogue records, Elvis Presley
movies, and Jeffrey Archer bestsellers). Even
within the Discourse of the cultural industries
themselves, in short, a distinction is drawn
between goods produced (and consumed) for
purely “commercial reasons” (and thus worthless)
and goods which exist for “artistic reasons,”
which cannot therefore really be understood as part
of the industrial process at all!
For the Frankfurt scholars, though (Adorno
found this sort of argument – about jazz, for
instance – ludicrous), the analytic significance of
the term “culture industry” was that it described
a production system, a system in which cultural
forms were determined by the logic of capital accumulation and not by any particular creative or
political decisions taken by any particular artists
or entrepreneurs. Detailed textual analysis or
comparison was unnecessary; all that mattered
was to understand the basic production process
(Adorno wrote about “popular music,” not
about specific songs), and so, whatever radical
or critical claims they may make, the effect of
cultural commodities is always the same: the
manipulation of desire in the pursuit of profit.
The Frankfurt school, in other words, treated
cultural consumption as pathological, as something to be explained in psychological and psychoanalytic terms (there was, significantly, a
clear overlap in its thinking here with that of
the advertising business, which was, of course,
precisely interested in the problems of consumer
control), and, in the end, Horkheimer and
Adorno used the term “culture industry” very
broadly, to describe the way in which a capitalist economy depends on the production not of
goods but of needs:
The stronger the position of the culture industry, the more summarily it can deal with consumers’ needs, producing them, controlling
them, disciplining them, and even withdrawing
amusement; no limits are set to cultural progress of this kind. (Adorno and Horkheimer,
1972, p. 144)

From this critical perspective, entertainment
(“amusement”) is crucial to social reproduction,

171
attention to all citizens’ interests, to assemble
audiences rather than to service markets.
In the context of analysis of the culture industries, though, the important point about public
service broadcasting is the evidence it provides that
the organization of cultural production is an
effect of state policies and legislative frameworks
and not just of market forces; in broadcasting
practice, therefore, the question is not either
public service or commerce, but rather the state
regulation, more or less detailed, of the cultural
marketplace. Regulation here is not just an
economic matter (a question of ownership and
control) but an ideological and a moral issue. Libel,
secrecy, and obscenity laws, for example, have
an effect on both what is (or is not) produced and
on who may consume it.
In the 1980s, partly as a result of technological changes that meant that the nation was no
longer the “natural” market boundary for cultural
goods (as satellite and cable operators began to
compete with broadcasters, so television became,
like the cinema, records, and print, an essentially
international medium), and partly as an effect
of the political emphasis on the use of market
rather than state forces to determine investment
and production decisions, there was across
North America and Western (and then Eastern)
Europe a general “deregulation” which had a
marked impact on the culture industries. The
decline of public service broadcasting in particular meant, at least in the short run, new opportunities for “independent” program makers and
producers (and technological changes, particularly
digitalization, made possible the decentralization
of even high-quality audiovisual production in
all sectors of the mass media). This was the context for a new use of the term “culture industries,”
with reference to their contribution (in comparison with other industries) to wealth creation
and employment. This was, to begin with, a
national response to the globalization of cultural
production. Governments began to ask themselves a question that was simultaneously economic
and political: does a country need a television
industry? A music industry? A sports industry?
(Any more than it needs a car industry? A computer industry?) What was the balance of economic
and political profit and loss in cultural investment?
These questions had a different resonance at the
local level. Regions and cities which were facing

culture industries

and Frankfurt studies in the 1930s and 1940s
tended to focus on the culture of entertainment,
on music, film, radio, and magazines (and
besides, as Adorno pointed out, fascism was a particularly “entertaining” form of mass political
mobilization, preoccupied with symbol and style
and the use of the unconscious).
Critical British and American cultural theorists
have customarily approached the mass media
from a different position, and for them the term
“culture industry” has therefore had a different
significance and focused different concerns (see
Williams, 1961). Here the political questions are
about ownership and control; the issue is the
ownership of knowledge and the control of
information (and the key culture industries are
thus taken to be the press and broadcasting rather
than, say, pop music and the cinema). From this
perspective, the specific policies of specific individuals do matter; texts (newspapers, magazines,
television programs) can be compared and
studied – they reveal the effects of different
owners, producers, and organizations.
This is to raise the question of whether or not
a culture industry is necessarily a capitalist form,
whether its practices are inevitably the effect of
commercial logic: can the state not influence or
control or regulate cultural production? These
questions have been addressed, in particular, to
broadcasting, and answered through the concept
of public service: “public service broadcasting” is
thus defined as an alternative to “commercial
broadcasting,” a way of funding program production and organizing radio and television
audiences which is determined by neither market
forces nor advertiser needs. Public service broadcasting (and, in principle, other culture industries
could be organized along similar lines), is thus
financed by taxes or license fees and is not subject to the ideological or political views of any particular property owner – its problem is, rather, to
negotiate the tricky relationship between state
and government, between political and professional
control. Similarly, public service broadcasters are
answerable to the needs of the “public” rather than
to those of advertisers or sponsors or shareholders,
and the “public” in this context is a composite,
made up of numerous “minorities.” A public
service broadcaster like the BBC is, in short,
expected to present news and information in an
“unbiased” and “balanced” way, but also to pay

economic decline as a result of the collapse of the
old heavy industries (steel, coal, shipbuilding,
etc.) looked to the “service sector,” to culture
industries, as a possible source of new investment,
new jobs, a new municipal profile. In the United
States Baltimore was the influential pioneer of this
economic strategy, which meant, among other
things, repackaging the now dead industries
as culture, as “heritage,” as an attraction for
tourists. In Britain “cultural industries policy”
was first developed at the end of the 1970s by the
left-wing Greater London Council, and although
its strategy reflected London’s importance as
a media and culture centre, the GLC’s treatment
of the cultural sector as an industrial sector
was taken up by most large Labour-controlled
municipal councils in Britain in the 1980s.
There are clearly contradictions between these
various accounts of culture as industry (even
though they all derive in one way or another
from a socialist critique of liberal economics)
and they have rather different political implications (Adorno, for example, and Raymond
Williams too, would surely find it bizarre that
a left-wing socialist council should invest in, say,
a video promotion studio). When they originally
used the term “culture industry,” Horkheimer and
Adorno were deliberately creating a little frisson,
putting together two terms that were meant to be
kept apart: “culture” was usually seen as quite independent of the economy. And even now, when
we are much more accustomed to the argument
that the market is the best guarantor of quality
and choice in this economic sector as in any
other, there remains a residual belief that the
production of culture is not quite like (or should
not be quite like) the production of other goods,
that it has an ideological and ethical significance
that cannot be entrusted to market forces. It is
striking, for example, that the politicians most
committed in the 1970s and 1980s to the deregulation of the media in ownership terms
(Thatcher and Reagan, for example) were also
committed to increased regulation in moral
terms (with reference to “video nasties,” the
“promotion” of homosexuality, etc.).
In short, culture industries are both like and
unlike other industries; and they are always therefore going to be the subject of intense political and
theoretical debate. Culture is too important for
the life and meaning of a nation for its produc-

tion to be left to private enterprise; and culture
is too valuable as a source of power and profit for
private entepreneurs to leave it alone.

`cultures and minds 
Cultures are seductive.
Have you ever been on holiday abroad and
watched, with a tourist’s yearning distance, the
“locals” in smooth concert with one another,
playing the lyra, the flute, the fiddle – laughing,
talking, knowing each other? I remember an
occasion in a village in southern Crete where
a group of conference attendees had emerged
from a long evening of intellectual discussion
in Kostas’s icon-filled cafeneon into the dark and
mostly deserted village square. Just one other
cafeneon was open. And a group of shepherds
had come down from the hills and were singing
together in it with a powerful camaraderie.
Occasional words were evident to us – the ubiquitous “Aman, aman,” the inevitable “kardia
mou,” and a few others. All we knew was the
mournful music and that they all knew what
they were singing. They were probably as curious
about us as we of them, eyes met even as they sang,
and renewed while we shared yet another raki, and
then moved reluctantly on. But that passing contact stays with me. I remember their enviable
togetherness and wanting to join them, to talk,
to understand, to belong to their secret community. “Other” cultures attract, they beckon, draw
us in, seduce. Rather like people really!
I am going to argue that cultures and minds
share a common history in some ways. They are

173

Common Problems The philosopher’s tormented
battle with the “problem of other minds” – now
dumped onto the methodical and systematically
confused shoulders of psychology – has not yet
ended. The problem lives in the impossible tension between feeling that we know that other
minds exist and deciding that we cannot prove
that they do. Try exploring with students the
certainty of their conviction that other minds
exist in conjunction with their equal certainty that
minds cannot be “known,” and something of the
frustration of this problem becomes apparent.
The problem takes different guises in different
hands – either it is only other minds that are seen
as opaque, with our own giving us privileged
access (the Cartesian analysis), or it is all minds
that are opaque, our own included (the theory
analysis). Within each account, however, other
minds are occluded from perception. They
become mysterious, occult, closed to the knower.
In the case of cultures much the same problem
has had a hold. “How can we get into the
native’s skin without actually being a native?” it
has been asked (see Geertz, 1995). The assumptions of opacity are almost entirely the same:
perceptual opacity is caused by the barrier of the
skin. We might think we can as little know, with
the kind of certainty we reserve for the word
“know,” the mysterious “culture” of the Greek
shepherds as we can the “mind” of the man
across the street, and we can be frustrated in the
extreme by our incomprehension of other cultures’
strangenesses. Yet we travel to see far away
peoples, despite distressing differences in diet or
temperature or habits of politeness and morality, and manage somehow to engage with them,
understand them, and even love them. Once
again, we could see the difficulty as lying with our
ability to understand other cultures while assuming that our own is transparent to us, or we
could see all culture as only being accessible to
conceptual understanding, to theorizing. In both

cases the assumption is that cultures are closed
and fundamentally inaccessible to the outsider.
Conceptualizing Minds and Cultures Has the
category mistake that Ryle (1958) accused psychology of making – in terms of separating the
kind of thing bodies are from the kind of thing
mind is, and thus leading to the odd conclusion
that if we can’t see minds therefore they are hidden – also been made by social anthropology in
relation to culture? Is culture similarly conceived
as a hidden determinant of actions, unavailable
to perception, but existing somehow in another
dimension similar to the Cartesian res cogitans?
Psychology has struggled hard with the consequences of this dualism. It has veered between
two unsatisfactory solutions to the impossible
situation of being a science of the unknowable.
The “argument from analogy” has led to what can
broadly be called first-person solutions, convincing up to a point, but presupposing the
very knowledge they claim to be uncovering
(Merleau-Ponty, 1961) and dependent on a
strikingly insecure solitary knowledge base for
their analogical inferences (Malcolm, 1962).
The theory or best-fitting hypothesis solution
(Hammond et al., 1991), what might be called
a third-person solution, is also convincing in
parts, but as a fundamental solution, holding
sternly to a blindness to all mentality, it is
fraught with absurdity (Costall, 2007; Leudar
and Costall, 2009).
The emic–etic debate within social anthropology offers not quite a parallel but something
close. It pits, in opposition to each other, two
angles on “other” cultures: we can describe or
understand them in terms of our own cultures,
or we can do so in their own terms, which we cannot quite relate to ours. Both of these angles
assume a necessary division between the “terms”
of each culture, they accept a difference that
cannot be bridged. For the scientist, more recent
solutions are on offer where the knower alternates
his or her position from one perspective to the
other and back again. Each “view” of the other is
informed and amended by the next view (Segall
et al., 1999).
But the very existence of the debate could be
seen to be postulating a Gap (like the presumed
Gap between Minds) that makes all bridges
inherently unsatisfactory. On the face of it this may

similarly and powerfully attractors of the outsider
and the uninitiated. They have been approached
academically with the same problems of apparent opacity, and they have been offered the same
unsatisfactory solutions. I will also suggest that the
same route – engagement – is the only one that
gets us access to either minds or cultures, and that,
in fact makes them what they are.

cultures and minds

seem a very strange argument. After all it is the
very fact of cultural differences, of our awareness
of different ways of thinking, speaking, categorizing, or responding, that leads us to ask: how
do we get across to each other despite the differences? No, I am not saying that all cultures are
“the same really,” as little as I am saying that all
minds are the same. But the Gap is problematic
because it imposes a top-down problem on a
very real difference. It posits a fundamental
separation (between minds or between cultures)
and assumes an essential lack of relation and
relatability. Identity is not the only route to
transparency.
Engagement, Participation and Knowing Many
writers have identified a difference between a
theoretical or inferential way of knowing and
something more direct. Sometimes the difference
is expressed in terms of “objective” rather than
“intersubjective” knowing; sometimes in terms of
an unreflective emotional engagement or genuine
dialogue rather than a reflective, more distant dialogue; sometimes in terms of participation and
involvement rather than observation or spectatorship. Whenever this distinction is drawn the
epistemological emphasis is on the engagement,
the relation, the involvement. And the route it
offers to knowing other minds is necessarily
applicable to knowing other cultures.
There is, for instance, John Macmurray’s
identification of relation as the key: “I can know
another person as a person only by entering into
personal relation with him. Without this I can
know him only by observation and inference;
only objectively” (Macmurray, 1961, p. 28). Or
there is Martin Buber’s distinction between the
I–Thou and the I–It as two forms of relating and
knowing, with the primary form, the I–Thou,
involving unreflective openness to the other in
emotional engagement (Buber, 1937). What if
we don’t enter into personal relation or open
ourselves in dialogue? Is there any way in which
we can observe from the outside and know? Yes.
We can. But our knowledge is necessarily that of
the bystander. Theoretical, indirect, inferential.
A third person knowledge. Useful sometimes.
Invaluable sometimes. But ultimately inadequate
on its own. It would be rather like the kind of
understanding that aliens observing earthlings
from afar might be expected to construct!

There are three key points that are necessary
consequences of accepting the primacy of
engagement. First, unless it is to be distorted
beyond recognition, personal relation or I–Thou
engagement demands a momentary transparency
of the one to the other. We engage not with the
other’s behavior but with the other as an intentional person and, however unreflectively and
unconsciously, we know the other as such. Their
minds are open to us within the engagement
because we feel a response to their intentionality
in relation to us. In other words, the Gap as
normally constituted disappears. Second, “the
other” that we have been talking about – whether
in relation to minds or cultures – has to disappear. If relation or engagement is primary
there can be no “the” before “other”; there is a
necessary plurality of others. “The other” is
limited to specific relations and there are as
many “others” as there are relations. Third, if
engagement or dialogue requires being open to the
other in emotional terms, then this openness or
unscriptedness (even if it is not mutual) must lead
to conversational or relational “products” that are
not knowable at the start. In other words, if
engagement or relation or dialogue is open, then
it takes you to places that you do not necessarily
anticipate – it creates the very things that you could
then try to understand reflectively. With regard
both to mind and to cultures, it is only in the process of emotional engagement that others can be
felt by us, and us by them, and that demands
the creation of new twists in being, new mental
or cultural elements, and that in this way allows
participation with them to turn into becoming
a part of them. In some small way at least our
involvement with other minds and other cultures includes us into their being.
How Engagement Begins A look at early
engagement in infancy can be informative. The
nature and processes of these engagements seem
to point to the constitutive nature of dialogue in
the early creation of minds and cultures.
Human neonates show from minutes after
birth not only an interest in things human (such
as faces and voices: Fantz, 1963; Goren et al.,
1975; DeCasper and Fifer, 1980; Johnson and
Morton, 1991) but an interest in engaging
with them to the extent that they imitate facial
and manual gestures (Meltzoff and Moore, 1977;

175
encourage in the infants those actions that the
culture values. Emotional engagements such as
clowning and showing off are vital for maintaining culture.
Even more crucial, however, is teasing. Culture cannot survive simply on the basis of the
affirmation of its practices by new members.
Arguably, it needs challenge and extension to its
boundaries and its practices in order to thrive.
Infant teasing is a fascinating example of how, even
in the first year of life, such challenge to boundaries can occur (Reddy, 1991). From as early as
nine months of age teasing by infants can typically be seen in the reversal of newly mastered
social gestures (for instance, having just learned
to give objects on request, infants often play
with these social routines, offering then cheekily
withdrawing objects when others reach out for
them), or in the deliberate and playful disruptions
of others’ actions (for instance, pushing cushions
back onto the floor as fast as the mother is clearing them up in order to vacuum the floor), or
in provocative noncompliance with others’ commands (for instance, deliberately reaching out to
“almost touch” the plug sockets, interested in
seeing how far they can push the parental reaction rather than in actually touching the socket).
Teasing can be seen as the archetypal creator of
cultural boundaries (see for instance, Groos,
1976). It is the essence of dialogue – where the
unexpected and the unplanned enter to keep
relations fresh and alive.
Engagement, ultimately, is the route we are on,
a route that latter day psychology had turned
away from, though anthropology (especially
since Malinowski) appears to have embraced it.
And it matters: it matters whether we see other
minds and other cultures as opaque or open, as
relatable to or as needing interpretation. It matters because how we think about this question
influences (although fortunately never entirely)
how we act towards them. If we think that other
people – take infants – have little in the way of
thoughts and feelings and sensitivities, we are
unlikely to take care in terms of protecting their
thoughts and feelings and sensitivities – much like
the belief in their lack of pain led to intrusive
practices like surgery without anesthesia, or the
skepticism about their emotional reactions to
conversations led to desperate experiments to
demonstrate it in the form of still face studies.

cultures and minds

Kugiumutzakis, 1998) and, watching intently,
even seek to provoke them in their absence (Nagy
and Molnar, 2004). Debates still rage about the
intentionality and communicative function of
neonatal imitation, but the phenomenon involves
an immediate responsiveness to the actions of
others that reveals a very early openness to cultural involvement. Within two months of birth
infants are involved in what has been called
proto-conversation, with reciprocal exchanges of
vocalizations, facial expressions, and arm movements (Bateson, 1979; Trevarthen, 1980; Stern,
1985). Infants during this period respond to adult
conversational initiatives with varieties of affect:
smiles (Wolff, 1987), distress, unemotional gaze
avoidance (Brazelton, 1986) or coyness (Reddy,
2000). The issue of whether these conversations
are actually intersubjective (Trevarthen, 2001,
2007) or merely involve the illusion of conversational turn-taking (Kaye, 1984) has been
extensively tested with the use of “still face”
and “double video replay” studies, which have
shown that a lack of contingent and appropriate
responses from their conversational partners
matters to infants (Murray and Trevarthen,
1985; Cohn and Tronick, 1989; Nadel and
Tremblay-Leveau, 1999), and that the previous
sensitivity and attunement of their mothers
affects the extent to which they are perturbed
(Legerstee and Varghese, 2001). Even at this
early age, infants develop expectations about
other people’s responsiveness and styles of
responding (including what one might see as
disturbed expectations when their experience
is problematic; Field, 1984), and carry these
expectations forward to new people they meet –
evidence of their involvement in culture even by
the age of two months.
Infants in the second half of the first year of
life not only tune into the habits and styles of the
people around them, but, interestingly, actively
contribute to the development of new cultural patterns. Developing an awareness of other people’s
reactions to specific acts and expressions they
happen to perform, they often deliberately repeat
these actions to re-elicit laughter, displaying the
motivation and sensitivity to humor of clowns,
or as showing off to elicit attention and praise
(Reddy, 1991, 2001, 2005, 2008). Their interest in
others’ emotional reactions to their own actions
serves to validate these reactions as well as to

cultures and minds

176
Perhaps even more seriously, if we see infants
as knowing little about our minds, we will make
little effort to express our thoughts and feelings
(perhaps when positive) or to disguise them
(perhaps when negative). We will create the
kinds of interactions appropriate for an infant who
cannot understand us – observing them, training
them, keeping them happy, but not really
engaging with them. But engagement is vital. Its
consequences are immediate in terms of affording or denying the baby the experiences that
could emerge from them, and also, of course,
for affording or denying the parent the experience
of the baby that comes from those engagements.
The way in which we allow ourselves to engage
with others circumscribes the way in which we
can know them: you might say, the more we
engage with others, the more we can engage with
them.
The same can be said about our engagements
with other cultures. If we shut doors on dialogue
– by assuming either our own blindness to their
thoughts and feelings or theirs to ours – we
would be at risk of creating the very reality we
assume. By not engaging we neither feel them, nor
constitute a shared reality, nor create the contexts
within which engagement can recover. The
seductiveness of other minds and other cultures
is worth giving in to.

 US radical lesbian
feminist philosopher. Daly’s first major books,
The Church and the Second Sex (1968) and Beyond
God the Father (1973), criticized misogyny in
the Christian churches and argued that men’s
spiritual authority over women is a major component of Patriarchy and must be rejected. Her
third and most controversial book, Gyn/Ecology
(1978), initiated new formal and thematic directions in Daly’s work. Arguing that patriarchy
constructs reality primarily through language,
Daly deconstructs patriarchal Texts as she seeks
a new language with which to realize radical
feminist consciousness and spirituality. Gyn/
Ecology, while excitedly praised, was also criticized
in an “Open letter” by Audre Lorde as racist
in its rhetorical strategies, falsely universalizing,
and exclusive. Although Daly never responded
to Lorde in print, the subsequent debate among
feminists productively clarified arguments for
and against radical feminism, Essentialism, and
separatism. Academic feminists in the United
States rarely cite Daly’s later work, including Pure
Lust (1984), Webster’s First New Intergalactic
Wickedary of the English Language (1987), and
Outercourse (1992), but Daly remains popular
and influential among radicals, especially those
influenced by French feminism, who value
Daly’s increasingly bold experimentation with
language.

 Departing from the ordinary German
use of the word, the German philosopher Martin
Heidegger used it to stand for the mode of
being of man, as distinguished from the mode of
being of tools and that of things. Dasein is characterized by being-in-the-world, and the latter
is characterized by the fundamental “moods”
of care and anxiety. Dasein is also essentially
temporal, it is oriented towards the future and
is being-towards-death. With this concept of
Dasein, Heidegger rejects the understanding of
the nature of man in traditional metaphysics
and religion.

philosophers, Davidson is best known for his
work in the theory of meaning. The key problem
here is the “creativity” of language, the ability of
speakers to understand a potential infinity of
sentences on the basis of a finite stock of words
and constructions. Davidson takes his cue from
the logician Tarski, who showed how to devise a
semantics for an artificial language, enabling the
determination of the truth conditions for each of
the language’s sentences. In “Truth and meaning”
(Davidson, 1984b, Essay 2), Davidson indicates
how this may be done for natural languages and,
crucially, claims that such a theory of truth is also
a theory of meaning. Roughly, to understand a
language is to grasp how its elements contribute
to the truth conditions of the sentences in which
they occur.
This approach has interesting results for
Cultural and Critical theory. First, it rules
out any cultural relativism according to which
peoples differ radically as to how the world is.
This is because translation of a foreign language
presupposes not only our ability to recognize the
conditions under which its speakers hold their
sentences to be true, but also the “charitable”
assumption that they succeed, by and large, in
holding to be true what actually is (by our own
lights) true (Davidson, 1984b, Essay 9). Second,
because the meaning (that is, truth-conditions) of
a sentence is independent of individual uses of it,
there is no such thing as non-literal meaning,
since metaphors etc. are phenomena of use. A
metaphorical utterance of “X” differs from a literal one, not in meaning, but in its aim of, say,
evoking images (Davidson, 1984b, Essay 17).
Recently (“A nice derangement of epitaphs,” in
LePore, 1986) Davidson has rejected the common
assumption that communication requires shared
conventions among speakers. It proceeds, rather,
by speakers making ad hoc adjustments in their
individual theories of meaning so as to match
them temporarily and to the degree required by
the particular verbal exchange.

metonymy.

`de Man, Paul (1919–83)
 American deconstructionist. Born in Antwerp, de Man was educated in Belgian universities in the years leading
up to the Nazi occupation. He began his writing
career in an anti-Nazi journal, Les Cahiers du
Libre Examen, which he edited for a short while.
Unable to escape into France during the Belgian
occupation, de Man obtained a job through the
offices of his uncle, Hendrik de Man, in a French
journal, Le Soir. He also wrote at this time for the
Flemish journal Het Vlaamsche Land. De Man’s
pieces in these journals were discovered after his
death by the Belgian scholar Ortwin de Graef.
At least some of the pieces were deemed to be
antisemitic even by de Man’s followers. An essay
singled out for attention is entitled “Jews in
contemporary literature” (1941), where de Man
focused on the contribution of Jews to the
European intellectual tradition. De Man suggested that the isolation of the Jewish race from
the European intellectual mainstream would not
adveresly affect European culture. Though this may
be charitably understood as staving off vulgar
antisemitism, the matter gets more complicated
when de Man suggests that Jews could be resettled in an “island colony.” It should, however,
be stated in de Man’s defence that he quit his job
with Le Soir in late 1942 when the true extent of
the Nazi persecution of Belgian Jews began to come
to light.
De Man’s early writings can be retrospectively
understood as offering us a valuable clue to his
lifelong suspicion of aesthetic Ideology and his
insistence on the ethical necessity of its Deconstruction. De Man was not the only European
intellectual to be bewitched by the lure of the
nationalist aesthetic, as is evident from the history of modernism. The disenchantment with
Liberal democracy was a widespread problem
in Europe during the interwar years. The call for
decisive action over endless bouts of rationalism
in political theory afflicted the political climate
with an intensity that is difficult for a postwar
intelligentsia to appreciate. In the choice between
cosmopolitanism and nationalism, the latter
seemed to offer something more concrete than the

179
Man became the most influential literary theorist in America. His best-known books, Blindness
and Insight (1971) and Allegories of Reading
(1979), were fruits of that period. De Man’s
influence over a whole generation of theorists
resulted from a rare combination of pedagogical,
philological, and philosophical skills. His originality lay in discovering the “method” of reading
that was to shake up academia under the rubric
“deconstruction” independently of the French
philosopher, Jacques Derrida. De Man is also
credited by the literary historian Frank Lentricchia
with having anticipated the central theoretical
insights of Harold Bloom, Geoffrey Hartman,
and J. Hillis Miller. De Man’s tenure as the eminence grise of deconstruction at Yale also saw
the advent of Derrida’s annual summer sessions
there in the 1970s.
Since the success of the Yale “school” is often
diagnosed as a shrewd mixture of American New
Criticism with continental esoterica, it will be
important to ask what exactly de Man borrowed
from the New Critics. The primary virtue of the
New Critics was a willingness to read closely
without being distracted by grandiose schemes of
thought. The promotion of its favourite Tropes,
Irony and Paradox, was at least based on a
willingness to read the Text “literally.” But this
does not mean that de Man was willing to buy
all the theoretical claims of the new criticism. An
important exception was the question of symbolism. Both romanticism and the New Criticism
had bought into the mythical therapeutics of the
Symbol. T.S. Eliot had famously referred to
the dangers of the “dissociation of sensibility”
that resulted from the poet’s inability to find an
“objective correlative.” This disjunction between
imagination and reason was understood to be
the result of a historical rupture, viz., the English
Civil War. This historical myth had its political
counterpart in the ideology of the Aesthetic.
De Man’s problematization of the symbol and
its deconstruction into allegory marks a decisive
shift in the fortunes of what a political criticism informed by deconstruction might be. The
literary equivalent of this is the deconstruction
of Metaphor into Metonymy, nature into
Culture, etc. It is at this point that de Man’s
work resonates with Derrida’s more systematic
questioning of the binarization of modes of consciousness in the Western metaphysical tradition.

de Man, Paul

by now empty universal ideals of the Enlightenment. Leading socialists like Hendrik de
Man began to believe that National Socialism,
by effecting change, might lead to a better alternative than the slow pace of reform in a liberal
democracy; hence the temptation to collaborate.
The Nazi aestheticization of the nation-state also
seemed to offer a solution to the age-old problem of Alienation. Cultural despair gave way to
the politics of soil, race, and blood. The Nazis
encouraged the belief that European nations
could piggyback their way into nationhood on
Germany. De Man went along with this idea. He
began to write in praise of the German nation and
its aesthetic ideals. With this went a devalorization of French literature: whereas the Germanic
spirit manifested itself in a penchant for organization, the French were trapped in the endless
analysis of the self. De Man also appears to have
been a historicist at this time. The Third Reich
promoted a teleological vision of history; in de
Man this is translated into the question of an
unconscious aesthetic determinism as it manifests
itself in literary history. Of course, there was not
a perfect alignment between his aesthetic and
political ideology, but the interimplication of
these two theoretical categories was to dominate
his later work as a deconstructionist.
De Man’s skepticism about the efficacy of
political action, in his later career, can then
be understood as a response to the naive
enchantment and subsequent despair of his early
journalistic career. Again and again he would
announce programmatically that the problems
of language (reading) had made it impossible to
attend to the questions of history. The preface to
his magnum opus, Allegories of Reading (1979),
begins with the famous words: “I began to read
Rousseau seriously in preparation for a historical reflection on Romanticism and found myself
unable to progress beyond local difficulties of
interpretation.” De Man’s interest in the “local
difficulties of interpretation” was forged initially by his encounter with the new criticism of
Reuben Brower, his mentor at Harvard, where
he earned a doctorate in the 1950s. After an early
stint at Harvard, de Man went on to teach at
Cornell, Zurich, Johns Hopkins, and finally at Yale,
where he became, in Frank Lentricchia’s words,
the Godfather of the “Yale Mafia.” As the head
of the so-called Yale school of deconstruction, de

`decentered structure
 A category introduced
by Althusser to distinguish between the Marxist
and Hegelian concepts of totality (see Marxism
and Hegelianism). According to him, the
Hegelian totality was an “expressive totality,”
whose parts were so many appearances of an
original essence which is the demiurge of history.
Transposed to historical Materialism, this conception generated an economic Essentialism
which abolished the Relative autonomy and
“specific effectivity” of the superstructural levels
of the Social formation.
By contrast, the Marxist concept of totality
was a complex one, to which neither “expressive”
nor “mechanical” models did justice. The Marxist
whole was inseparable from the parts or elements
of which it was constituted. It was characterized by
irreducible states of Overdetermination, since
each social practice or contradiction formed the
“conditions of existence” of the others. Accordingly, it contained no essence to be expressed,
or center to be reflected: it was a “decentered
structure.” Nevertheless, it was a “structure in
dominance,” unified by a dominant structure and
by economic “determination in the last instance.”
In his Lacanian-influenced work on Ideology,
Althusser likewise maintained that the human
subject was “decentered,” for it was “constituted
by a structure which has no ‘center’ either,
except in the imaginary misrecognition of the
‘ego’ ” (1964, pp. 170–1).

`deconstruction
 School of philosophy and
literary criticism forged in the writings of the
French philosopher Jacques Derrida and the
Belgian/North American literary critic Paul De
Man.
Deconstruction can perhaps best be described
as a theory of reading which aims to undermine the logic of opposition within Texts (see
Binary opposition). For Derrida this requires
a scrutiny of the essential distinctions and conceptual orderings which have been constructed by
the dominant tradition of Western philosophy.
In a series of engagements with thinkers as diverse
as Plato, Hegel, Rousseau, Kant, Husserl,
Austin, and Lévi-strauss, Derrida adopts a
strategy of reading which questions the assumptions and limitations of textual meaning by
revealing how the polarities and certainties a text
has proposed have actually been constructed
through a series of preferences and repressions
which have privileged certain ideas, values,
and arguments above others. Derrida’s point is
that what has been presented as a dichotomy in
Western thought, such as man/woman, is in
fact merely a difference which has been manipulated into a hierarchy. However, contrary to
some literary and postmodern appropriations of
his writings, Derrida’s thought does not aim at
the dissolution of analytic distinctions altogether,
nor is he concerned with a simple reversal of
hierarchical oppositions. As Derrida and some
of his more subtle acolytes are well aware, positing difference against identity succeeds only
in falling back within the very logic of binary
opposition their deconstructive enterprise tries
to resist. Instead Derrida works to displace and
reinscribe concepts into larger and more encompassing contexts. His typical practice includes
applying the meaning and potential of a concept against the limits within which it has
been constructed. Hence his questioning of the
“structurality of Structure,” the cause of the
cause, or the context of the context attempts to

181
An immanent expressive consciousness would
remain imprisoned in the subject’s head without
the conditional intervention of indicative signs. The
very necessity of such an intervention renders consciousness nonself-identical, opening it out into
the realm of the social, historical, and conventional.
By a curious reversal of logic, Derrida shows
how what has been relegated to a secondary
status in Husserl’s argument (indicative signs)
actually conditions any conscious expression.
Derrida’s critique aims not at a reversal of the
opposition, but rather an articulation of the
Paradoxes, Ambiguities, and Contradictions which destabilize the initial opposition.
So, in the case of Husserl, Derrida exposes how
what has been posited as the source of meaning
(expressive consciousness) remains dependent
on, and therefore affected by, what has been
constructed as of secondary importance, therefore
deconstructing the initial opposition.
Deconstruction not only scrutinizes the primary
texts of Western culture, it also reflects on the
readings and interpretations which have produced the status of these dominant works.
Deconstruction is therefore a reflection on the act
of reading, examining how interpretations have
been produced, and what these interpretations
have marginalized, presupposed, or ignored.
Derrida’s readings require a meticulous attention to textual evidence and logical contradiction
where the movement of writing may subvert the
interpreter’s quest for a unified meaning. This
search for incoherences and points of resistance
marks Derrida’s poststructuralist break with the
unifying and systematizing methodologies of
theoretical Structuralism.
Derrida’s critique of conceptual oppositions
is often facilitated by his focus on what has been
relegated to the margins of a text’s argument. His
typical practice often demonstrates how footnotes, metaphors, elisions, and other details an
author has deemed to be of little importance to
the task at hand, actually condition the explicit
argument of a text. It is this always implicit
subtext which Derrida attempts to reveal as a
determining force, a textual unconscious which
can always be read against the grain of what a text
intends to say. Importantly, Derrida’s critique of
intentionality does not simply abandon it in favor
of a limitless textual freeplay of interpretation.
Rather, it explores the structural constraints

deconstruction

prise open the metaphysical closures of Western
philosophy.
At its best, Derridean deconstruction lays bare
the logic, presuppositions, and structures which
constitute the dominant tradition of Western
thought. As Barbara Johnson observes, deconstruction is a form of immanent critique which
situates itself inside a text in order to tease out the
“Warring forces of signification within the text”
(Johnson, 1984, p. 5). Deconstructive criticism
does not claim to resolve such textual conflicts
and contradictions in some ideal Hegelian synthesis. Rather, it believes there to be something
intrinsic to the structure of language (for Derrida
– writing) which complicates any attempted
textual unity. Derrida’s terms “differance” and
“dissemination” articulate both the possibility
and the impossibility of pinning down a coherent,
unproblematic meaning of a text (see Writing).
Derrida’s modified concept of writing functions
as a metaphor for the absence of both a unitary
subject and a stable referent in any text, whether
spoken or written. Such absences (he claims) are
the unavoidable consequence of using Signs to
make and communicate meaning. The intervention of the linguistic sign divides the subject
and the referent from themselves, and it is
these divisions and absences which open up the
possibility of textual misinterpretations and
misunderstandings. It is the search for these
systematic contradictions and uncontrollable
ambiguities in meaning which perhaps best
characterizes deconstructive criticism.
Derrida’s deconstructionist method entails
highlighting a pair of oppositions with a text and
then demonstrating, via a close attention to the
logical contradictions, repressions, and limitations
of the argument, how the opposition ceases to hold
up under analytic critique. For example, in Speech
and Phenomena (1967c) Derrida deconstructs
the “essential distinction” Husserl makes between
expressive and indicative signs. Derrida places
under scrutiny the possibility of maintaining a pure
realm of expressive signs which transmit the
voice of consciousness independently of their
articulation in an indicative language. This quest
for an unmediated expressive consciousness
breaks down (Derrida maintains) at those points
where Husserl must recognize the necessity of
language and the indicative as being inseparable from the very possibility of any expression.

which always render explicitly stated intentions
liable to deconstruction. Such a deconstruction
often proceeds by illustrating how authorial arguments undermine themselves by falling victim to
the very ideologies or methodological procedures
they have diagnosed as deficient or outdated in
other theorists’ work, or by demonstrating how
the metaphysical aspects of a thinker’s philosophy may actually be undone by some of his most
radical theoretical notions. This point is evident
in Derrida’s reading of Saussure in Of Grammatology (1967a) where Derrida reveals how
Saussure’s most radical principles (the arbitrariness of the Sign and meaning through difference)
undo his metaphysical belief in the existence
of a “natural bond” between spoken words and
true meaning.
What Derrida seeks to elucidate in his readings
of Western philosophy is the necessary “logic
of supplementarity” which is inscribed in every
pretence towards clear-cut conceptual distinctions. For Derrida, there is always something
which eludes the grasp of conceptual self-identity.
There is a necessary lack present in every identifying moment, a lack which is inherent in the very
Structure of language which must be used to
define and articulate concepts. Importantly, the
supplement is not simply the result of an error
or slip on the part of the author. Rather, it is
something systematic which can be most easily
identified in the texts of those thinkers who are
most rigorous in their conceptual work.
In a manner strikingly similar to the strategy
of Negative dialectics developed by the
German philosopher Theodor Adorno, Derrida
attempts to include within thought all that
has been considered heterogeneous to it. The
supplement is always there as the nonidentity
within identity which undermines the distinction between the two. Like Adorno’s, Derrida’s
thought is anti-foundationalist in its belief that any
first principle, or privileged starting point for a
coherent philosophical system, is already split by
the differential and supplementary structure of
language (see Saussure). To understand concepts, origins, and centers as “always already”
different from themselves in their very inception
in language is to question the whole practice
of constructing stable identities between terms.
Once it is acknowledged that concepts do not
exist in their own solitary space with a clear,

unambiguous, unitary meaning attached to them,
any opposition based on identity becomes difficult to sustain. Deconstruction elucidates both
the differences within and the differences between
supposedly stable identities.
Deconstruction has had an impact on numerous disciplines within cultural criticism, the
humanities, and the social sciences. In sociology,
Anthony Giddens has integrated Derrida’s insights
into a theory of structuration which attempts to
articulate the at once constraining and enabling dialectic of structure and Subject, while in
historical scholarship New Historicists and
cultural materialists have utilized deconstructive
arguments in order to uncouple classical oppositions between cause and effect, text and context,
and primary and secondary sources.
Despite Derrida’s academic training in philosophy, his writings have exerted their greatest
influence in literature departments, particularly in
the United States, where critics such as J. Hillis
Miller, Geoffrey Hartman, and Allan Bloom
have assimilated Derrida’s insights in order to
break with many of the traditional assumptions
of literary criticism.
Perhaps the most articulate of the North
American deconstructors was Paul de Man.
For de Man, deconstruction required a thorough
reading of a text’s rhetorical constitution. De
Man’s usual deconstructive maneuvers focus
on those moments in a text where the logic of an
argument becomes complicated and undermined
by the figural language of the text. For de Man
this conflict of meaning between the literal and
the figural is a persistent occurrence in the
texts of Western philosophy. His readings of the
central texts of Western Culture demonstrate
how philosophy cannot escape the dimension
of figural language, no matter how far it presses
its claims to communicate clear and distinct
conceptual meanings. De Man maintains that
the task of theory (that is, deconstruction) is not
to impose itself upon a text but rather to follow
through the literal and figural textual logic in order
to spot the places where a text self-deconstructs
and resists theoretical reduction, by slipping
away from its own stated intentions as well as
the critic’s best attempts to explain it. For a de
Manian there is something inevitable about a
text’s deconstruction and it is the responsibility
of the astute critic to elucidate these moments.

183
political potential of deconstruction. Marxists,
feminists, and postcolonial critics such as Michael
Ryan (1982), Barbara Johnson (1990), and Gayatri
Spivak (1994) have all harnessed deconstructive
methods to challenge many of the ideological
and institutional structures of Western culture. To
affirm a politics of deconstruction would perhaps
be premature, but its potential may reside in
its persistent questioning of the ideologies, dogmatisms, and hierarchies of existing political
thought. This impulse may not spark a revolution,
but it might ensure a democratic vigilance towards
postrevolutionary complacencies.

`defamiliarization 
(also “baring the device”)
A term used mainly by formalist literary
critics, among them Viktor Shklovski, Roman
Jakobson, and other members of the Soviet and
Czech formalist circles of the 1920s and 1930s.
In their view the chief function of poetic language
was to defamiliarize our normal (everyday or
prosaic) modes of perception. This it achieved
by deploying a wide range of linguistically
“deviant” devices – Metaphor and metonymy,
Symbolism, rhyme, rhythm, meter, complex
patternings of sound and sense – in order to

defamiliarization

The direct challenge posed to the philosophical
tradition by deconstructionists such as de Man
and Derrida has led to many Anglo-American
philosophers adopting a position of cautionary
skepticism toward the value of deconstruction’s
claims. Clearly, any theory which appears so
radically to challenge many of the cherished
beliefs of philosophers will be treated with due
caution. However, the reaction of many philosophers to the project of deconstruction has
often been based on summary readings of Derrida
(for example, Habermas) or, even worse, the
rhetoric of some of Derrida’s less philosophically responsible literary acolytes. The important
point to grasp is that deconstruction, at least that
form of critique practiced by Derrida and de
Man, aims less to turn the tables on philosophy,
by privileging rhetoric above reason or fiction
above truth, and more to developing a philosophically accountable theory of the workings of
rhetoric, Metaphor, and language.
As Derrida explains in his essay “White
mythology,” which appears in his book Margins
of Philosophy (1972b), concepts may indeed be
regarded as sublimated metaphors, lacking any
secure referential gound in their functioning
as substitutes for other words; however, at the
same time the notion of metaphor itself can only
be understood and developed by the resources
of philosophy which conceptualizes metaphor,
rhetoric, and figuration. Hence Derrida’s point is
not that deconstruction enables a reversal of the
opposition between philosophy and literature,
concepts and metaphors, but rather it allows a
rethinking of the conditions of possibility of
both philosophy and literature, and how the two
may in fact be articulated together. Deconstruction’s strongest claim is that the two must be
thought together if theorists are to produce the
most rigorous account of both philosophy and
literature.
The alleged political radicalism of deconstruction has been challenged by Marxist critics (see
Marxism). Pointing to deconstruction’s lack of
explicit political commitment and its neglect of
social and economic reference, these critics, Terry
Eagleton (1981) and Peter Dews (1987) most
prominent among them, argue that undermining political and institutional antagonisms cannot be reduced to an exposé of textual conflicts.
Other critics have been less keen to close off the

deictics

184
focus our attention more sharply on those
devices themselves and also on the new-found
possibilities of experience which they serve to
evoke. The idea is captured most precisely in the
Russian word ostranenie (or “making strange”).
Shelley had advanced a similar claim when he
spoke of Poetry’s power to create the world
anew by stripping away the “veil of familiarity”
– the routine, automatized habits of response –
which exert such a deadening effect upon our
minds and sensibilities. For Schklovski this idea
had ethical as well as aesthetic or literary implications. The familiar was that which consumed
and destroyed all our most vital experiences,
from the reading of poems and novels to our
food, clothing, friendships, marriages, political
involvements, and indeed the very sense of ourselves – and others – as living particulars not
to be subsumed under general (custom-made)
categories. Poetry could help to resist this process
by “baring the device,” that is to say, through
its capacity to Foreground and renovate the
resources of a language worn smooth by conventional usage.
There is a parallel here with the Alienation
effect (Verfremdungseffekt) which the dramatist
Bertolt Brecht proposed as a means of jolting theater audiences out of their passive, complacent,
or “bourgeois” habits of mind. It also finds a
close – if less fashionable – analogue in the work
of an overtly moralizing critic like F.R. Leavis.
For in his essays on poetry – especially on
Shakespeare, Donne, and Keats – Leavis constantly stresses the link between language in its
“creative–exploratory” aspect and those modes
of heightened or revivified perception that constitute an adequate (“mature” and “sensitive”)
response. That Leavis rejected literary theory as
a pernicious distraction from the critic’s proper
business may offer one clue as to why some
theorists – Paul de Man among them – for their
part regard this whole way of thinking as a
species of naïve mimetic delusion or wholesale
“aesthetic ideology.”

`Deleuze, Gilles (1925–95) 
and Guattari,
Félix (1936–92) French philosopher and French
psychoanalyst respectively. Much of modern
European thought, especially in France since the
1939–45 war, has actively been in search of a
means to bring philosophy and psychoanalysis
– particularly Marx and Freud – into fruitful contact with each other. The extraordinary partnership of Deleuze and Guattari had been more
successful than any other such attempt to
achieve this contact. In the final book they wrote
together – What is Philosophy? (1991) – they
arrived at an elegant summary of their common
project, which had been previously launched in
The Anti-Oedipus (1972). The question asked in
the title of their last book is promptly answered.
Philosophy, they say, is “the art of forming,
inventing, and fabricating concepts” (Deleuze
and Guattari, 1991 (1994), p. 2). Realizing, however, the incompleteness of this answer, they
proceed to supply an agent who forms, invents,
and fabricates. Philosophy requires “conceptual
personae” who are friends. Here the gap that
Aristotle opened up between himself and Plato,
the divide he marked between truth and friendship, is brought to closure. “With the creation
of philosophy, the Greeks violently force the
friend into a relationship that is no longer a
relationship with an other but one with an
Entity” (p. 3). Although they do not name this
an Aristotelian violence, Deleuze and Guattari
quickly move to subdue it and to reaffirm friendship and agency. While acknowledging that two
friends inevitably assume positions of “claimant
and rival,” they proceed, nevertheless, to affirm
that “the philosopher is the concept’s friend” in
the sense that he is the “potentiality of the concept.” They thus want to embrace Nietzsche’s
claim that concepts do not wait, like heavenly
bodies, but they must be invented with “their
creator’s signature.” What should not be missed
here, however, is their unique combination of

`Derrida, Jacques (1930–2004)
French philosopher. Educated at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, Derrida is best known in the
anglophone world for forging the critical practice
of Deconstruction. His earliest philosophical
influences came from the tradition of Phenomenology as represented by Hegel, Husserl,
and Heidegger, with a book-length introduction
to Husserl’s Origin of Geometry (1962) marking
Derrida’s first published work.
Derrida’s broad defense of Husserlian phenomenology in his earliest writing placed him
outside the dominant theoretical Structuralism
which hegemonized French intellectual Culture
during the 1960s. However, the first glimmerings
of Derrida’s deconstructive method and structuralist sympathies, later to accord him widespread
acclaim, are evident in his reading of Husserl’s
philosophical idealism. Derrida’s critique of
Husserl demonstrates how any notion of an
immanent consciousness, able to glean an objective knowledge of ideal objects, breaks down at
those points in Husserl’s argument where language
and Writing are recognized as unavoidable
means of communication and knowledge. The
ideal of a pure and immanent perception becomes
problematized when the tools of such a consciousness must come from a social, historical,
and conventional language produced independently of both the object and the Subject. The
intervention of the structural sign as a necessary
medium of representation, dividing and deferring
the possibility of a pure self-consciousness, is
a persistent theme in Derrida’s readings of the
dominant tradition in Western philosophy.
Critical attention to Derrida’s work increased
during the mid-1960s, particularly in the United
States, where in 1966 Derrida delivered his
seminal paper, “Structure, sign and play in the discourse of the human sciences,” at Johns Hopkins
University (later to be published in Writing and

`Della Volpe, Galvano (1895–1968) 
Marxist
theorist. Included in the empirical or neo-Kantian
school of Western Marxism, Della Volpe’s central aim is to rescue Marxism from the humanists, such as Lukács and Korsch, who reject
the materialism of the natural sciences, and to
reestablish Marxism as a materialist sociology. In
his Text Logic as a Positive Science (1950), Della
Volpe draws out the positivist themes inherent
in Marxism, as he discusses Marx’s revision of the
circle of the Hegelian dialectic from Abstract–
Concrete–Abstract (A–C–A) to Concrete–
Abstract–Concrete (C–A–C), or the circle of
materialist epistemology. What has become
known as the Della Volpean reconstruction is an
attempt to prove the scientificity of Marxism.
Della Volpe argues that the reconstruction of
the Hegelian dialectic effects a transition from
“a priori assertions to experimental forecasts”
(Della Volpe, 1980, p. 198). Critics of the Della
Volpean school, most notably one of the theorist’s
own pupils Lucio Colletti, argue that his hypernaturalistic approach to Marx ignores the themes
of Reification and Alienation.
Though Della Volpe joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) relatively late in 1944, he
exercised a formative influence on an emerging
group of theorists which included – apart from
Coletti – Pietranera, Rossi, and Cerroni, who
pursued the scientific and deterministic implications of his work in analyzing Italian society.

Difference (1967b)). The occasion, a conference
celebrating structuralism, saw Derrida scrutinizing the very history and theoretical constitution
of the concept of structure via a detailed exposé
of the presuppositions and limitations of Lévistrauss’s structural anthropology. Focusing on
the metaphorical construction of the notion of
structure and its privileging of central explanatory
terms, Derrida sought to provoke a questioning
of the “structurality of structure”: a reflection on
the constructedness of what have been presumed
in structuralist Discourse as unconditioned
centers and origins which supposedly provide
grounds for objective accounts of diverse phenomena. These foundations (Derrida claims) are
assumed to have a fixed meaning, a “transcendental
signified,” which functions as an unmovable
limit on the “play” of structure, thereby closing
off the possibilities of structural instability and
change.
Derrida’s argument did not aim to transcend
structuralism. Rather, it turned structuralist
arguments against their own limits and presuppositions. His acute observation that the
supposition of stable structures depends on the
privileging of a fixed center or given origin,
posited independently of structural determination,
enabled him to become more rigorously structuralist than the structuralists themselves. The
poststructuralist moment Derrida’s arguments
were supposed to initiate refers less to a break
with structuralism and more to an expansion of
structuralism to its logical self-undermining conclusions (see Poststructuralism). By drawing
predominantly on the resources of structural
linguistics (see Saussure), Derrida attempted
to show how any ground for a structuralist
science is “always already” divided from itself
via its constitution in the differential structure
of language. First principles and master concepts
(on this account) tend less to be naturally
important explanatory tools and more to be
arbitrary constructs designed to privilege a certain way of thinking and reasoning above other
possibilities.
The year 1967 was to prove the most important
in terms of Derrida’s publishing and reception
history. Three major books: Writing and Difference, Speech and Phenomena, and Of Grammatology witnessed Derrida following Nietzsche and
Heidegger in elaborating a critique of “Western

metaphysics.” Western thought, Derrida claimed,
had been structured in terms of hierarchical
oppositions where one of the terms had been
given a qualitative and/or temporal priority over
a supposedly derivative, inferior, or undesirable
Other (see Binary opposition). For Derrida
such dichotomies tend to privilege identity,
immediacy, and presence over difference, deferral, and absence.
Many of Derrida’s encounters with the tradition of Western thought attempt to reveal and
undermine what he sees as the fundamental
binarism which betrays this “Western metaphysics
of presence,” that of speech over writing. Western
philosophy from Plato onwards (Derrida says)
has classed writing as a parasitic and imperfect
representation of the pure ideas contained in the
living voice of speech. This hierarchy, he argues,
is produced by a logocentric culture which privileges the thinking, speaking subject who knows
his own mind, says what he means, and means
what he says. In opposition, Derrida’s critique
attempts to subvert the belief in the “voice of consciousness” – that is speech seemingly dependent
on a subject’s pure spontaneity of thought;
an expression of ideas freely independent and
undetermined by any supplementary structures,
Codes, and conventions taken from the world
outside the mind.
In opposition to this, Derrida proposes that
speech is in fact a form of writing, where the
speaker’s meanings and intentions are always
deferred. The very structural possibility of spoken
words being transcribed into a written form
reveals speech to have the same general characteristics as writing, and the consequence of this
recognition (Derrida maintains) is that speech
should not be regarded as an unambiguous transmission of clear and intended meaning from
person to person, but must instead be studied
as a form of writing, a dissemination, where
meaning is continually being reinscribed and
reinterpeted in different contexts. By writing,
Derrida does not mean merely the inscriptional
mark of the signifier; rather he means the system
of spatial distinctions and temporal deferrals
which are inscribed in any system of Signs.
Derrida destabilizes the dichotomy between
speech and writing with his notion of a general
or “arche-writing,” at once reversing the opposition and reassessing the respective elements by

187
which can then be remedied. It is rather that
there is something structural in the very nature
of writing which necessitates contradiction and
interdependence. It is this structural logic which
Derrida attempts to articulate.
By seizing on authorial repressions, footnotes,
and other seemingly incidental details, often
confined to the margins of a text, Derrida tries
to demonstrate by a reversal of traditional logic
how what has been posited as central, primary,
or originary remains affected by, and therefore
dependent upon, what has been constructed as
secondary, marginal, or derivative. What Derrida
calls Aporias are those moments where oppositions are held in mutual suspension, neither term
of which can be granted structuring primacy or
qualitative superiority. Derridean logic therefore replaces the logic of either/or with a logic
of both/and (and/or) neither/nor. Hence on
the speculative question of which came first at the
origin of language, the social structure or the
individual utterance, the answer is both and neither, an indeterminancy which has led to some
criticisms of Derrida from the followers of the
tradition of analytic philosophy, who point to
his dissolution of conceptual distinctions into
a general field of textuality and indeterminancy.
This is a criticism invited by many postmodern
appropriations of Derrida’s work (see Postmodernism), but a criticism less powerful when
faced with the analytic power of many of Derrida’s
own most analytically rigorous essays (for example, in his volume Margins of Philosophy, 1972b).
Contrary to many appropriations of his work,
Derrida maintains a complex notion of authorial
intentionality, a commitment particularly evident in his readings of Saussure, Rousseau,
Foucault, and Austin. Derrida regularly shows
how authorial intent monitors and is modified by
structural constraints. Indeed, his readings often
register their effect by contrasting the intentions
of an author with what he is constrained to mean.
Derrida’s typical use of the notion of intentionality focuses on what an author may have considered to be an irrelevant or insignificant detail;
or a theoretical model an author has claimed to
transcend; and then he shows how the author
remains imprisoned within the very conceptual
structures he seeks to undermine or dispense
with. As Derrida comments in his critique of
Foucault’s history of unreason: how can a history

Derrida, Jacques

placing the identities given them by metaphysical
discourse into question.
Similarly, Derrida’s deconstruction of Austin’s
speech-act theory proceeds by highlighting a
pair of oppositions, in this case between serious
and nonserious Speech acts, and then demonstrating how the distinctions Austin constructs fail
to stand up to close textual scrutiny. The features
Austin assigns to supposedly parasitic, nonserious speech acts (such as citations and textual graftings) also permeate so-called “serious”
speech acts, which can only function owing to
the repetition inscribed in every meaningful
sign. Derrida’s deconstruction of the opposition
entails at once a reversal and displacement of
its component parts under a general covering
concept, this time a “general citationality.” Any
representation, any Signifying element, whether
phonic or graphic, must presuppose a structure of
repetition, what Derrida calls “iterability,” which
undermines any pretence towards self-present
and context-free meaning. The very possibility
of a word being repeated and interpreted in a
potentially infinite range of situations and contexts undermines its metaphysical claims to
self-identity.
However, in his reading of Austin, Derrida is
not merely replacing a metaphysics of the sign
with a metaphysics of context. The potential
limitlessness of context (Derrida claims) and the
impossibility of securing an immanent, selfpresent context closes off the possibility of some
pure contextual determination of meaning that
is not always already rein-scribed in a different
context. What results in Derrida’s writing is a
radical contextualization and historicization of
meaning which attempts to endlessly defer any
final suppression of the process of reinscription
and recontextualization.
For Derrida there is always a “logic of the supplement” inscribed in any pretense toward clear
conceptual identity. There is always something
which escapes and subverts the logic of binary
opposition and it is these excesses and resistances which Derrida turns against metaphysical
thinking. By immersing himself within the very
structure of a text’s argument, Derrida attempts an
immanent critique which would expose its Contradictions, limitations, and presuppositions.
It is not that a text can be deconstructed because
of a weakness or flaw in a thinker’s argument,

of madness be written “from within the very
language of classical reason itself, utilizing the
concepts that were the historical instruments of
the capture of madness” (Writing and Difference,
1967b (1978) p. 34)?
Derrida himself accepts the impossibility of
completely escaping metaphysics. His prose often
parades the sweat and strain which comes from
the recognition that in order to subvert metaphysics he must occupy its very intellectual
constraints. Derrida’s solution to this dilemma
takes the form of his strategic deployment of
double-edged concepts which unhinge the logic
of binary opposition. A supplement can be both
an addition and a substitute; a pharmacon both
poison and cure; and hymen both consummation
and virginity. Such a doubleness is the characteristic feature of Derrida’s thought and serves in
differing contexts as a substitution for the double movement of writing (differance) as at once
the condition of possibility and impossibility of
meaning.
The reception of Derrida’s work has been a site
of conflict and controversy, with philosophers
tending to dismiss his work with all the fervor with
which literary critics have embraced it. Derrida’s
biggest institutional impact has perhaps been in
North American literature departments. Critics
such as Geoffrey Hartman, J. Hillis Miller, and
Allan Bloom have assimilated and developed
Derrida’s insights in all manner of creative
ways in order to subvert the traditional assumptions of Literary criticism. Such a reception
of Derrida’s work among literary acolytes has
prompted the suspicions of Enlightenment
philosophers, for example, Jürgen Habermas
(1987), who dismisses Derrida’s thought (on the
basis of an inadequate acquaintance with his
work) as a species of irrationalist postmodern
theorizing. However, postmodern thinkers like
Richard Rorty (1982) have heralded Derrida as
a postphilosophical literary stylist, a latter-day
sophist, who is at his best when he reveals
philosophy as little more than a collage of
Metaphors, rhetorical devices, and unanchored
language games. Derrida, Rorty claims, undermines
the pretensions of philosophy by revealing it
for what it is: simply a form of Writing with no
privileged access to meaning and truth.
Such postmodern readings of Derrida are
encouraged on the evidence of some of his

more exuberant texts, such as Glas (1974), where
Derrida puns and wordplays his ways between
the boundaries of philosophy and literature as
represented by Hegel and Genet in juxtaposed
columns of print. Similarly Derrida’s response
to Searle in “Limited Inc abc” (1977) accords
little respect to analytic distinctions as well as
the copyright laws, as he employs a variety of
textual graftings in order to turn Searle’s text
inside out.
However, other commentators have defended
Derrida’s philosophical merits with a particular
stress on his earlier work as providing the “hard
labor” of his philosophical enterprise. These
critics, Christopher Norris (1987) and Radolphe
Gasche (1986) most prominent among them,
maintain that Derrida’s work pays the utmost
attention to matters of argumentative detail and
philosophical accountability, often producing
readings that are more philosophically rigorous
than much analytic philosophy. In an attempt
to wrest Derrida’s work away from a neoNietzschean postmodern skepticism, these critics
argue that Derrida’s style of thought can best
be situated within the broad tradition of postKantian critical reason.
Certainly the appearance of Derrida’s longdeferred book-length engagement with the
Marxist tradition, Spectres of Marx (1994) seemed
to confirm the analysis of the likes of Norris. This
book finds Derrida going clean against the grain
of much of the postmodernist wisdom which
proclaims the demise of Marxism as an intellectual and political activity. Arguing strongly against
modern variations of the “end of history” and
“end of Marxism” theme, and acknowledging his
own intellectual debt to the Marxist problematic,
Derrida calls for the continual reading and rereading of the texts of Marxism, and the urgent contemporaneity of Marxism as a political practice.
This work underlines what is perhaps Derrida’s
greatest achievement: his persistent questioning
and rethinking of what have become taken-forgranted intellectual complacencies.

`determinacy
 First used by the scientist
Hermann von Helmholtz, the term “determinacy”
or “determinateness” has a broad application.
The condition of being determinate can imply a
certain constraint upon contingency, effected by
assigning definite qualities to an entity or process. Hegel, for example, distinguishes between
“being,” which is abstract, and “determinate
being,” which possesses qualities. But, in Marxist
theory and sociology, “determinacy” (more usually “determinateness”) has often been linked
with a prior process of determination (not to be
confused with predetermination). Understood in
this sense, determinateness has figured centrally
in the works of structuralist Marxists such as
Althusser, who have stressed the “scientific”
and deterministic thrust of Marx’s Canon rather
than the elements which emphasize human
agency in historical transformation. Althusser
uses the concept of Overdetermination (taken
over from Freud) to express the specificity of
the Marxist notion of Contradiction and in
particular its divergence from Hegel’s dialectic.
Whereas Hegel’s formulation of Contradiction as the causal site of historical change is
“simple,” embodying a process of cumulative
internalization of previous forms of consciousness
and history, Marx’s notion of contradiction is
“overdetermined”: it is determined not uniformly but by a variety of levels and instances of
the Social formation it animates.
Althusser’s views have generated much debate,
made possible by the dialectical and flexible
approach of Marx and Engels themselves to the
degree of determinacy possible in historical predictability and inevitability. While they stress the
ultimately determinative power of the economic
substructure, they suggest that what makes this

`diaspora 
A term traditionally associated with
the Jewish exile, but now used in Cultural theory to cover a range of territorial displacements,
either forced, such as indenture and slavery, or
voluntary emigration. Recent formulations have
stressed not only the complex ties of memory,
nostalgia, and politics that bind the exile to an
original homeland, but also sought to illuminate
the lateral axes that link diasporic communities
across national boundaries with the multiple
other communities of the dispersed population.
Paul Gilroy’s (1993) image of the “Black Atlantic,”
for instance, evokes an imagined geography of
the African diaspora, a space not reducible to an
original source, but where divergent local experiences of widely dispersed communities interact
with shared histories of crossing, migration,
exile, travel, and exploration, spawning hybrid
Cultures. Much of the current work on borders,
transnational networks, and global public culture
draws on this concept of the diaspora to understand the spectrum of displacements, revivals,
and reconfigurations of identities and traditions
that characterize the contemporary global cultural
landscape.

discourse

190
`discourse
In its broadest, least technical sense,
“discourse” means simply “talk” or “conversation,”
sometimes with the hint of a didactic purpose
(thus “sermon,” “treatise,” or “lengthy address to
some particular topic”). This latter development
seems rather at odds with the word’s etymology,
going back to the Latin verb discurrere, “to run
about,” “range widely,” “wander off course,”
etc. And indeed there is something of the same
ambiguity – or tendency to pull in opposite
directions – when the word is taken up (as it has
been often of late) into the usage of various specialized disciplines. I shall therefore look at some
of the issues it raises for philosophy, linguistics,
and the human sciences in general.
The linguist Emile Benveniste was among the
most influential thinkers in this field. According
to him, “discourse” has to do with those aspects
of language that can only be interpreted with
reference to the speaker, to his or her spatiotemporal location, or to other such variables which
serve to specify the localized context of utterance.
It thus lays claim to a distinctive and well-defined
area of study, one that includes the personal
pronouns (especially “I” and “you”), Deictics of
place (“here,” “there,” etc.) and temporal markers
(“now,” “today,” “next week,”) in the absence
of which the utterance in question would lack
determinate sense. Structural linguistics – following Saussure – treats language (la langue)
as a transindividual network or economy of
Signifying elements, conceived in ideal abstraction from the individual speech act. Benveniste
on the contrary sets out to analyze the various
subject positions (“enunciative modalities”) that
constitute the realm of discourse, Parole, or
language in its social-communicative aspect.
Nevertheless, what he shares with Saussure’s
poststructuralist disciples is the working premise
that subjectivity is constructed in and through
language, since quite simply there is nothing
(no possible appeal to the Kantian transcendental Subject, to a priori concepts, self-evident
truths, primordial intuitions, facts of experience,
or whatever) that would offer a secure vantage
point beyond the play of discursive representations. Clearly there are large philosophical
implications bound up with this idea of language (or discourse) as the absolute horizon
of intelligibility for thought and knowledge in
general.

This is also what sets Benveniste’s work apart
from J.L. Austin’s otherwise similar concern
with the kinds of performative or Speech-act
modality exhibited by various instances of everyday discourse. It may well be the case – as argued
by poststructuralist adepts like Shoshana Felman
– that Austin’s theory is itself subject to all
manner of performative slips, “misfires,” and
returns of the linguistic unconscious repressed.
However, these anomalies require much ingenious coaxing from the style of down-to-earth,
commonsense talk that goes with Austin’s suasive
appeal to the wisdom enshrined in “ordinary
language.” Benveniste writes out of a very different intellectual culture, one that has traditionally
laid most stress on the Cartesian virtues of system,
method, and lucid self-knowledge. All the more
provocative, therefore, is the way that his work
seems to open a cleft – a moment of slippage or
dehiscence – between the self-possessed subject
posited by Descartes’ cogito, ergo sum and the
Subject as construed in discourse-theoretical
terms, that is to say, a pronominal “position”
caught up in the endless passage from signifier to
signifier.
Such at least is the reading of Benveniste
propounded by poststructuralists eager to dissolve
all the certitudes (or “foundationalist” truth
claims) of philosophy from Descartes to the present. On this account it is the merest of illusions
– albeit an illusion deeply bound up with the entire
project of “Western metaphysics” – to imagine
that thinking could ever attain the kind of punctual, transparent, self-present grasp envisaged by
“logocentric” reason. In Benveniste’s terms the
error can be diagnosed as a failure to distinguish
between two levels of discourse, those pertaining
respectively to the “Subject of the enounced”
and the “Subject of the enunciation.” Thus
when Descartes offers the cogito as an indubitable
ground of knowledge – a last refuge against all
the threats of epistemological doubt – he can
do so only by performing what amounts to a
rhetorical sleight of hand, an utterance that
seeks to collapse this distinction between the “I”
who thinks and the “I” that is constituted as the
subject–object of its own reflection. In that case,
poststructuralists would argue, the Cartesian
project necessarily miscarries, since it generates
linguistic Aporias beyond its power to contain or
control. And the same applies to those subsequent

191
prevent it from ever coinciding with its object in
a moment of achieved equilibrium.
We are therefore (Lacan argues) hopelessly
mistaken if we hold psychoanalysis accountable
to standards of enlightened truth-seeking thought.
It is the sheer opacity of the Freudian text – its
resistance to any kind of lucid expository treatment – which Lacan views as the purveyor of truth,
albeit a “truth” that can scarcely be expressed in
conceptual or rational-discursive terms. This is
also (though some would consider it a charitable
reading) why Lacan’s own texts go out of their
way to create syntactic and stylistic obstacles for
anyone who looks to them in hope of discovering
an easy route of access to the Freudian corpus.
On the contrary, such access is everywhere
denied by a style that raises difficulty into a high
point of principle, or which (less kindly) takes
bafflement as a guard against the requirements
of plain good sense. Again it is Descartes who
figures most often as the thinker who first set
philosophy out on its delusory quest for “clear
and distinct ideas.” But Psychoanalysis has
traveled the same path, Lacan argues, in so far as
it has embraced the imaginary ideal of a pure,
unimpeded self-knowledge, an end point to the
therapeutic process when all such resistances
would fall away and the subject accede to a full
understanding of her/his (hitherto repressed or
sublimated) motives and desires. It is against
this heresy – which he associates chiefly with
American ego psychology – that Lacan directs both
his fiercest polemics and his practice of a style that
makes no concessions to the Cartesian “tyranny
of lucidity.”
Some philosophers – Jürgen Habermas among
them – have rejected not only this Lacanian
reading of Freud but also the entire poststructuralist project of which it formed a prominent
part. In his early book Knowledge and Human
Interests (1968) Habermas set out to defend psychoanalysis against the charge of “irrationalism”
that has so often been leveled against it. Freud is,
on the contrary, a thinker who belongs very
firmly to the Enlightenment tradition, or in
the company of those – from Kant to Husserl
– who have sought to sustain the “philosophic
discourse of Modernity” in the face of various threats from skeptics and opponents like
Nietzsche. At this time Habermas had not yet
adopted his stance of overt antagonism toward

discourse

philosophies – from Kant to Husserl – which
invoke some version of the transcendental subject as locus and arbiter of truth.
Hence the recent spate of speculative work
– mostly by literary theorists – on the margin
between philosophy and Psychoanalysis, the
latter having taken its own poststructuralist turn
through the teachings of the eminent (if maverick) practitioner Jacques Lacan. To this way of
thinking – “French Freud” in colloquial parlance
– there is no means of access to the unconscious
save through the discourse between analyst and
patient, a discourse whose transferential character is marked by all manner of linguistic swerves,
substitutions, and displacements. Moreover, we
can best read Freud by attending to those
symptomatic moments in his work where the
“agency of the letter” (or the deviant “logic” of
the signifier) emerges to disrupt and complicate
his own project. If the Unconscious is indeed
“structured like a language,” as Lacan claims,
then the insights of linguistics – especially those
derived from the work of structuralist thinkers
like Saussure and Jakobson – are simply indispensable for any reading that would respect the
exigencies of the Freudian text and not fall prey
to various kinds of naive or mystified account.
This may require some degree of terminological latitude, as when Lacan suggests that terms
like “Condensation” and “Displacement” were
adopted by Freud ( faute de mieux) from the
mechanistic discourse current in his time, but that
now – after Jakobson – we should reader the one
as “Metaphor” and the other as “Metonymy,”
thus restoring the unconscious to its proper
dimension as a field of tropological drives and
exchanges. Metaphor then becomes that aspect
of the dreamwork – or the process of secondary
revision – whereby one signifier substitutes for
another, or where numerous meanings condense
into a single image or symptom (Overdetermination). And metonymy stands in not only
for “displacement” – the endless passage from
signifier to signifer – but also for desire in so far
as it connotes a kind of structural nonfulfillment,
an ineluctable lack which he equates with the
Saussurian “bar” between signifier and signified.
For desire is distinguished from straightforward
(instinctual or physical) need by its entanglement in precisely those structures of discourse
– of transference and deferred meaning – which

Post-structuralism and allied strains of
counteren-lightenment thought. However, it is
clear enough already that he interprets Freud’s cardinal maxim – “Where Id was, there shall Ego be”
– in a manner diametrically opposed to Lacan’s
teaching. On this account the phrase is best construed as a version of the Kantian motto Sapere
aude! (“Have the courage to think for yourself !”),
that is to say, as an appeal to the values of reason and emancipatory knowledge in the private
as well as the public–political sphere. Thus for
Habermas the task of psychoanalysis is to bring
the subject to a conscious (reflective) awareness of
those repressed or sublimated memories, motives,
and desires that would otherwise stand in its
way. In so far as Freud’s theories can claim any
kind of intellectual validity or therapeutic power,
they must be seen as deriving from that same
tradition of enlightened Ideologiekritik, a tradition whose resources Habermas equates with the
interests of a genuine participant democracy premised on the values of open dialogical exchange.
Nothing could be further from Lacan’s response
to the question that Freud famously posed in
the title of his late essay “Analysis terminable
or interminable?” From a Lacanian standpoint
there is simply no end to the detours of the
unconscious signifier, the way that language –
or the discourse of desire – is forever caught up
in a metonymic chain whereby truth becomes
purely a figment of the Imaginary, a function
whose value cannot be assigned except in relation
to this or that transient subject position, like the
purloined letter in the story by Edgar Allan
Poe which Lacan took as a kind of allegorical
mise-en-scène for the psychoanalytic encounter.
Such are the complexities of Transference and
counter transference – the two-way exchange of
Symbolic roles between patient and analyst –
that nobody can occupy the privileged position
envisaged by the ego psychologists and other
perverters of the Freudian truth. Like Descartes
(as Lacan reads him), they are the victims of a
specular misrecognition whose effect is precisely
to bolster the ego’s deluded hopes of making
reason master in its own house. Small wonder that
Habermas, in his later writings, has targeted this
whole poststructuralist discourse as a species of
latter-day Nietzschean irrationalism allied to a
deeply conservative turn against the truth claims
of enlightened critique. To this the Lacanians

respond – predictably enough – by deploring his
attachment to an outworn discourse of reason,
enlightenment, and truth, a discourse (so it is
argued) whose liberal rhetoric conceals a tyrannizing will-to-power over language, desire, and
whatever eludes its self-assured rational grasp.
It is hard to imagine any possible rapprochement between those (like Habermas) who
would uphold the values of critical-emancipatory
thought and those others (postmodernists and
poststructuralists among them) who regard such
values as possessing no more than an illusory
or long since obsolete appeal within the philosophic discourse of modernity. And this despite
the fact – very evident in his recent writings –
that Habermas has himself travelled a long way
toward acknowledging the force of certain antifoundationalist arguments, thus abandoning at
least some areas of the Kantian high ground
staked out in a work like Knowledge and Human
Interests. What this amounts to is a version of
the currently widespread “linguistic turn,” the
invocation of language as an ultimate horizon
of intelligibility, or the denial that we can ever
attain any knowledge save that vouchsafed
through discourses, language games, Signifying
Systems, structures of representation, etc. Habermas has taken full measure of these arguments,
redefining his project in terms that derive from
speech-act philosophy and the theory of Communicative action, as distinct from those
epistemological concerns that characterized his
earlier work. However, he rejects the postmodernpragmatist idea that discourse – so to speak – goes
all the way down, that rhetoric (not reason) is what
finally counts, since the only criterion for a valid
or persuasive argument is the extent to which
it happens to fit in with some existing language
game or cultural “form of life.” Such doctrines
are philoso-phically bankrupt, expressing as they
do a vote of no confidence in the capacity of
thought to criticize false beliefs, to distinguish
valid from invalid truth claims, and to analyze the
causes – psychological or social – that produce
various kinds of prejudice, self-ignorance, or
“commonsense” dogmatism. Moreover, they are
politically and ethically harmful in so far as they
promote a conservative agenda of inert consensusbased values and attitudes, an “end-of-ideology”
creed which equates truth with what is (currently
and contingently) “good in the way of belief.”

 One of a series of

objects, relations, regularities, and strategies –
introduced by Michel Foucault (1974). Discursive practices are characterized by groups of rules
that define their respective specificities. In contrast to the analysis of Discourses as Systems
of Signs, Foucault treats discourses as “practices
that systematically form the objects of which
they speak.”

dissociation of sensibility The supposed
rupture between thought and feeling in the seventeenth century. T.S. Eliot coined the term in his
essay on “The metaphysical poets” in 1921,
describing it as “something which happened to the
mind of England between the time of Donne . . .
and the time of Tennyson” so that sensibility
ceased to be “unified” and poets “thought and felt
by fits, unbalanced.” Eliot later noted that it
“had a success in the world astonishing to its
author,” and it in fact became the foundation of
an entire revisionist literary history, especially in
the work of F.R. Leavis and the New Critics. Later

dissociation of sensibility

This is why Habermas describes his project as
a “transcendental pragmatics,” one that makes
room for a critique of those existing values from
the standpoint of an “ideal speech-situation,”
a regulative idea (in the Kantian sense) of what
we can and should aspire to as participating
members of a free and open democratic society.
For it is clearly the case that any current (de
facto) consensus may always be subject to a range
of distorting pressures and influences, as for
instance through the workings of state censorship,
press manipulation, media bias, educational
underprivilege, inequalities of access to the relevant information sources, etc. What Habermas
therefore seeks to conserve – and what sets him
decidedly at odds with the current postmodernpragmatist wisdom – is a critical sense of those
factors that conspire to thwart or frustrate the
shared aspiration to a public sphere of openly
communicable reasons, motives, interests, and
values. Nor are these issues confined to the realm
of abstruse philosophical debate. For it can
readily happen – as with recent variations on the
post-ideological/“new world order” theme – that
some existing currency of consensus belief in,
for example, the virtues of “Liberal democracy,”
US style, is taken at face value without any
question being raised about the sheer gulf that
exists between rhetoric and reality, or the actual
effects of US policy in the domestic and geopolitical spheres. Only by keeping such distinctions
in view can philosophy live up to its social and
ethical task, that is to say, its commitment to
a critique of consensus values wherever these
serve as a refuge or smokescreen for other, less
humanly accountable interests. To this extent –
and despite his concessions to the anti-foundationalist case – Habermas still keeps faith with the
discourse of enlightened or critical-emancipatory
thought, a project whose central (Kantian) tenet
is the exercise of reason against the more beguiling self-images and rhetorics of the age.

`diversity and culture 
“My motto is diversity.” The words are from Jean de La Fontaine’s
“Eel Pie.” What other genius could be more
French than the fable-writer? Yet, at the risk
of displeasing the partisans of France’s famed
“cultural diversity,” there are quite a few who
think that our country cares only for its own
diversity – that it lovingly cultivates its range
of wines, cheeses, perfumes, and other libertine
refinements but very grudgingly eases ajar its
door and Republican institutions to the diversity
of the rest of the world.
As a European citizen of Bulgarian descent,
French nationality, and American adoption, I
am responsive to such criticism. However, after
several decades spent in France, I should like to
emphasize three facets of my experience which to
me illustrate France’s contribution to Europe’s
specificity.
To begin with, Europe is now a political entity
where at least as many languages are spoken
as there are member countries. This linguistic
pluralism is the founding element of a cultural
diversity that needs to be preserved and respected
in order to preserve and respect the various
national characters. At the same time, these
characters need to be exchanged, mingled, and
cross-fertilized. Saint Bernard, back in the
twelfth century, saw the European as a “subject
of love,” after blending the Song of Songs with
his adventures as a Crusader, and the physical
self-analysis inseparable from a tormented spirit,
finally finding solace in beatitude. The Renaissance reconciled us with the marvels of Greece and
the pomp of Rome. In the seventeenth century,
Descartes revealed the ego cogito to an age of
emerging science and burgeoning economy. It

was the eighteenth century that, along with the
charms of libertinage and beggars’ rags, introduced
the concern for individualities expressed in the
charter of human rights. After the horror of
the Holocaust, the nineteenth-century bourgeois
and the twentieth-century rebel had to meet the
challenge of another age. Today, Europe’s linguistic
diversity is creating kaleidoscopic people able to
cope as well with the “Globish” English imposed
by globalization as with good old “Francophonie”
– which finds it tough to shed its Versaillais
dreams for the task of becoming the transmitting
fluid of tradition and innovation and mixing its
genes. A new human species is slowly emerging:
the “polyphonic person,” the multilingual citizen
of a multinational Europe. I shall try to formulate
some necessarily subjective ideas on this active process, singularizing to the extreme the intrinsically
plural psychic universe of these future Europeans. Young Europeans are gradually coming
to terms with this polyphony. I myself had the
good fortune of noticing it forty years ago when
General de Gaulle awarded me a grant to study
in Paris. Although a skeptical European, he was
a confirmed visionary who even then imagined a
Europe stretching “from the Atlantic to the Urals.”
Next, I shall discuss the diversity represented
by the “French social model,” a chimera to be
nurtured and perfected. I claim that it forms
part of a European model of liberty, all the more
necessary today when humankind is being automated under the influence of technology.
Last, I shall express my desire to see French
secularism, that other “French exception,” taken
seriously throughout the world – amazed as I
am by our trivial effort to make it understood
outside our frontiers – by all those who are
increasingly aware that flirting with community
separateness is not unconnected with “the clash
of religions.”
The foreigner – and nowadays the European
traveling from one country to another, speaking
his country’s tongue as well as that, or those,
of the others – differs, since he speaks another
language, from the person who is not foreign.
In Europe, we shall not be, or are no longer, able
to escape from this condition. Foreignness is
affixed to our original identity, like a more or less
permanent second skin.
Looked at more closely, this fact is more
extraordinary than it might appear. It indicates

195
as to follow where an argument leads, and the
impossibility – more political than moral – of
backtracking on a judgment. Mallarmé’s ellipses
enchant me; so many contractions in the seeming pallor of ordinary subjects give every word
the compactness of a diamond, the surprise of
throwing a dice.
I have entered so far into this other language,
which I have used for forty years, that I can
almost understand the Americans who take me for
a French thinker and author. Sometimes, though,
when I come back to France after a trip to the East,
West, North, or South, I cannot identify with the
French attitude that dismisses the world’s evil
and misery and preaches off-handedness or even
nationalism as the cure-all for our century . . .
which, alas, is neither the Grand Siècle nor the
century of Voltaire-Diderot-Rousseau.
For all that, I love returning to France. I said
this in “Possesions” and I say it again, I love
returning to France. No opacity, no drama, no
puzzle. Obviousness. Transparency in language
and cool sky.
I know very well that there is France and
France and that not all the French are as crystalline
as they would have us believe. Yet, arriving from
Santa Barbara, this is the vision that strikes. That
the French are a thinking people is apparent
virtually everywhere. Your being becomes logical
in the instant. Effort flows away and dispute,
although perpetual, evaporates in seduction and
irony.
I house my body in France’s landscape of
logic. I shelter in Paris’s urbane, prosperous,
and smiling streets. I rub shoulders with these
ordinary world-weary, self-contained people with
their impenetrable but finally polite intimacy. The
French built Notre-Dame cathedral, the Louvre,
conquered Europe and much of the world, then
went back home. Preferring serenity, a pleasure
synonymous with well-being, to the pleasure
of fighting. But since they prefer pleasure over
reality, they still believe they are masters of the
universe or, at least, a major power. And the
universe, condescending, irritated, fascinated,
seems ready to follow them, us, for the moment,
often reluctantly. Here human violence has
surrendered to the taste for gaiety, and a quiet

an exceptional destiny, at once tragic and privileged. In my case, at the meeting-point of at
least two languages, I handle a word-form that has
the surface of French, smooth as the stone of
a holy water font, but encloses the dark gilding
of Orthodox icons. It ornaments with prophetic
allusions the clarity of those who are because

What of hurt in this valiant mixture of blood?
I was expecting the question and my answer is only
half-prepared. There is an element of matricide
in the abandonment of a native tongue. It hurt
to lose my Thracian bee-hive, the honey of my
dreams, but there was also the pleasure of
revenge, and the pride of having achieved the ideal
of the native bees . . . to fly higher, faster, more
powerfully than their parents. It is not for nothing that the Balkans of today are heir to Greece,
Byzantium, the Ottoman Empire. Our children
will have Russian, English, French, “American,”
and globalization spread out in front of them.
Since Rabelais, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the
organized crime of the oligarchs, exile, a painful
path always, is the only way left to us in seeking
the dive bouteille. The divine flask can be found
only through search aware of its searching, or exile
eschewing the certainty and insolence associated
with exile. In this boundless grieving, where
language and body relive in the scansion of
grafted-on French, I put my ear to the still-warm
corpse of my maternal memory. Not involuntary
nor subconscious, no, maternal. At the far edge
of intoned words and unfathomable pulsations,
but close to the sense and biology which my
imagination can summon up in French, lies the
ache I feel, Bulgaria, my souffrance.
In this experience of the “other tongue,” I hold
a dialogue with Bulgaria, but in souffrance I hear
“France.” My dialogue is addressed as much, if
not more, to the chosen language as to the one
bestowed at birth.
The logical clarity of French, the impeccable
exactitude of its vocabulary, the sharpness of its
grammar beguile my methodical mind and strive
to impress a straightness on my connivance with
the Black Seas of passion. I regret leaving behind
the lexical ambiguities and often indefinable
plural meanings of Bulgarian speech, untamed by
Cartesianism, consonant with the heart’s desire
and the night of the senses. Still, I love the Latin
punch of concepts, the obligation to decide so

Does our pride in spreading Francophonie,
which runs counter to the spread of English,
Globish, and more, take account of these delights
and aches? Perhaps we should, in transmitting
the taste for the French language, its literary traditions and present mutations, begin by making
France’s situation – philosophy, art, subjects of
discussion – intelligible and shareable. Before we
spice the taste for Francophony and, why not, communicate its virtues and glories, we could convince
and win over by explaining the state of France in
other people’s languages. Europe and the world
in their turn invite us on that journey, where the
home-born French have everything to gain.
Without going further into this cohabitation
with the “other language,” I turn to its cultural
and political context. As proved by topical social
and political events, our country is the one
where liberty considered as rebellion assumes an
amplitude possibly unequalled in the world.
France’s national unity is a historical accomplishment that has the air of a cult or myth.
Of course, each one is tied to his family, clan
of friends, profession, or province. Nonetheless,
there is a real national cohesion, more compact
perhaps than elsewhere, bedded in the language,
the legacy of the monarchy and Republican institutions, rooted in the art of living and that
harmony of shared customs which we call French
taste. The Anglo-Saxon world is a family one. In
France, the family is an essential refuge, naturally,
but it is also in France that Gide could say,
“Families, I hate you.” Its meta-familial envelope
is neither the Queen nor the Dollar, it is the
Nation. Montesquieu, in The Spirit of Laws,
stated it definitively: “There are two kinds of
tyranny: the real kind, government violence, and
that of opinion, which is felt when those who
govern introduce things which shock the Nation’s
way of thinking.” This “Nation’s way of thinking”
has been an omnipresent political datum . . .
since the Renaissance and the Napoleonic Wars.
It is a source of pride and is an absolute factor
in France. In the recent past, we have many
examples of its degenerating into parochial
foreigner-loathing nationalism. But to leave it
out of account would be blithely unthinking, to
say the least.
It is, moreover, a cohesion that likes to
break apart: into networks, sub-groups, clans.
Their rambunctious rivalries produce a fine and

amusing diversity as well as a harmful cacophony.
As Chamfort wrote, “In France, there is by
reason no more public or nation than shredded
cotton is linen.” Under the Fifth Republic, as the
different political parties can attest, the shredding can hardly be said to have diminished. The
political arena is designed for harmonizing these
conflicting stands, these incompatible power
relations. Is this balancing act less successful in
France than in other countries? I think not. The
French like to show off, parade, demonstrate,
display, and share out their bruised feelings and
purse-strings in public. This exhibition of bad
temper does not result in a media circus. It is
taken half-seriously, with doubt and mockery.
While impressed, the people do not embark on
a “Monicagate” or an O.J. Simpson trial. The
French may like spectacle but they laugh at
dramatization.
National pride can transmute into Poujadist
arrogance and a lazy disinclination towards
enterprise. There are many French who are turned
off by Europe and the world, who simply find
solace in hankering for “lost time.” But national
pride has sides to it that are trump cards in
this post-industrial age. For this “people,” that of
Robespierre or Saint-Just or Michelet, poverty
is not a handicap. “The eternally unfortunate
people,” dixit Sieyès. “The downtrodden applaud
me,” rejoiced Robespierre. “The oppressed are
the force of the earth,” concluded Saint-Just.
More than in other countries they feel a sense of
superiority: that of belonging to an illustrious
civilization that they would not for worlds swap
for the enticements of globalization. A pity, it is
said, that the French are neither very enterprising
nor very competitive. Even our students are not
keen on pursuing their studies abroad. In the
other direction, plenty of foreign students are
pleased to come and learn what the French have
to teach. The imbalance is the subject of wide concern, and the search for remedies has begun. The
fact remains that the sense of dignity that removes
shame from poverty and puts value on the quality
of life is again becoming an attractive target for
people in the developing world, as for those in
the industrialized world who feel victimized by
automation, ungodly working hours, unemployment, and the lack of social protection.
Of course, when this demanding and haughty
entity, the people of France, addresses the

so easily to despise others, neglect the world,
and make no entrepreneurial effort, gone? Overconfidence? Today this cockiness is mixed with
self-devaluation, which can tip over into decrial
of oneself and others. The depression sufferer is
someone with tyrannical ideals; indeed, a draconian superego, demanding a supposedly deserved
perfection, is the deep-down motor of depression.
I formulated this theory in 1990 in an open letter
to Harlem Désir. The malady has had its highs
and lows since then, the nadir being reached
before the parliamentary dissolution of 1997. It
may be remarked that, after the ensuing elections
and a concomitant or prospective upturn in the
economy, the mood of the French has brightened.
The 2007 presidential election campaign, which
mobilized the French to a surprising degree, much
more than in previous consultations, would
seem to show that a revival of citizen spirit is under
way. But the depressive undercurrent has not
disappeared.
The psychoanalyst, when confronted with a
depressed patient, begins by rebuilding selfconfidence, restoring the self-image and the
relationship between the two actors in the cure, so
that speech becomes fruitful again and a genuine
critical analysis of what is wrong can be undertaken. Similarly, a depressed nation needs to have
an enhanced image of itself before attempting
to tackle European integration, industrial and
commercial expansion, and better treatment of
immigrants. It is not a question of flattering the
French, or lulling them with the illusion of having qualities they lack. But the country’s cultural
heritage – its aesthetic, technical, and scientific
capabilities – despite no lack of highly justified
criticism, are insufficiently emphasized, especially
by the intelligentsia, always quick to exaggerate doubt and push Cartesianism to the point
of self-loathing. “Nations, like men, die from
imperceptible discourtesies,” wrote Giraudoux. I
wonder whether our Third-Worldist cosmopolitan generosity has not conducted us into committing “imperceptible discourtesies” that have
aggravated the national depression. It is time to
start curing it. For if the depressed person does
not kill himself, he finds an outlet for his distress
in manic reaction: instead of maligning himself,
repressing himself, or sinking into inertia, he
starts hunting for enemies, usually imagined ones,
and embarks on wars, which are naturally holy

government, the supposedly hoped-for dialogue
turns into a test of wills. But it must not be
thought that the situation is deadlocked. What if,
for example, we managed to take seriously the
popular demand to distribute the nation’s – and
the world’s – wealth more equitably? As a precedent, it would surely interest other countries. A
competitive Europe will not be truly free until it
succeeds in reconciling the pace of globalization
with the popular demands that France expresses
today with the greatest amount of conviction.
Yet our feeling is that the country is suffering
from depression like a human being. Depression
is one of the commonest syndromes of our time.
Recent statistics show that our country has one
of the highest suicide rates in the world: fourth in
Europe, behind Finland, Denmark, and Austria.
(Obviously, we do not count the former Soviet
bloc, Japan, or China.) Depression has a complex
array of causes – narcissistic injury, deficient
maternal relationship, lack of paternal ideal, etc.
All of them lead the depressed person to depreciate the ties that bind, beginning with language
– the depressed person does not talk, loses faith
in communication, retreats into silence, weeping,
immobility, inertia – and ending with the tie
to life (the death wish and suicide). Increasingly
today, we see that individual depression is an
expression of social distress: job loss, prolonged
unemployment, occupational harassment, poverty, lack of future and purpose.
France, we may say, is living through a
national depression similar to the kind that
afflicts individuals. We have lost the great power
image that de Gaulle had restored. France has more
and more difficulty making its voice heard, finds
it hard to get its way in European negotiations and
competition with America. Migration flows have
created the problems with which we are familiar.
There is a pervasive, not always justifiable, feeling of insecurity and menace. The simple, clear
ideals and prospects of the old demagogic, yet
appealing, ideologies do not cut ice any more.
In the circumstances, the country reacts like a
depressed patient, whose first instinct is to withdraw, stay at home, lie in bed and remain silent
except to complain. Many French people accord
no credit to politics and community life, they
cease to act, they moan, are scared of others, fear
Europe. Where have the traditional chauvinist
arrogance and crowing, which led the French

wars. You will have recognized the Front National
and fundamentalism. Several times in recent
years, this xenophobia and these archaisms have
made me consider another exile, to leave France
and settle in the States, or Canada . . . and find
more archaisms, more xenophobia?
In the meantime, I place my trust in the respect
for public life, de-stigmatization of poverty, solidarity in helping the poor, pride in the cultural
heritage, the cult of enjoyment and freedom, the
construction of a just and dynamic Europe, which
France, not content with being a member, must
inspire. I distrust the enticements of archaism,
nationalism (which is not the nation), and
sexism.
The French personify both the discontent of the
underclass (that of Robespierre and Hugo) and
the brazenness of a nation that takes pleasure (from
Rabelais to Colette). Is this a hindrance? Within
the European area, it can be an opportunity, so
as not to die celebrating the end of history with
market deals. The new forms of rebellion require
the help more than ever of the elites and specialized groups (professions, age cohorts, etc.). Is it
impossible to reconcile the “people,” the “elites,”
and the “opinion sectors”? Difficult, certainly,
but impossible? As regards the “elites,” it is not
the “people” who lack consideration for them, it
is the elites themselves. When they fail to show
concern, they confine themselves in technicalities
and rip one another up in internecine strife.
But they do exist and, in the laboratories and
universities, as well as in the creative arts, outstanding achievements are not rare. One example
is the biology-law-philosophy-psychoanalysisaesthetics forum, on the cursus of the Institute
for Contemporary Thought, which I initiated
along with others at the University ParisDiderot; it is necessary not only for sustaining
the impetus in biology but also for dealing with
biology’s excesses. French researchers have the
best approach in the matter, and public opinion
is not indifferent.
Have we regressed since the 1960s? In America
I hear, “Nothing more is happening in France.”
Perhaps or perhaps not. On the surface, what
is happening is less spectacular. The media are
saturated with “shows”; work in depth does not
come across well on the TV screen, when it is
seen at all. It still goes on, possibly with more
seriousness than before.

France is wanted in Europe. Perhaps it takes a
stranger like myself, but French by adoption, to
draw attention to this fact on the eve of elections
that inspire so much uneasiness and hope.
France is, after all, the primary upholder of a model
of liberty bred in Europe and needed by the
world.
The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 highlighted
the difference between two models of culture:
European culture and North American culture.
To avoid any misunderstanding, I hasten to add
that we are talking about two conceptions of
liberty that the Western democracies, as a whole
and without exception, have the honor of having
developed and done their best to implement.
We are not sufficiently proud of this. The two
conceptions of liberty rest upon Greek, Jewish,
and Christian traditions. Despite the notorious
failures and abominations, freedom remains our
supreme value. The two conceptions, especially in
the present state of affairs, can often be set, and
even war, against one another. A look at them will
let us better understand what seems to separate
Europe from America today, much more radically
than their immediate political and economic
interests do. Yet, basically, the two versions of
liberty are complementary and, to me, equally
present in us on both sides of the Atlantic. At the
risk of simplifying, I shall, for the sake of clarity,
continue to pit them one against the other.
It was Kant, in his Critique of Pure Reason
(1781) and Critique of Practical Reason (1789), who
for the very first time defined what other humans
had probably observed without achieving his
clarity of vision – namely that liberty is not negatively an “absence of constraint” but is positively
the possibility of Selbstanfang, “self-beginning.”
Kant, identifying liberty with self-beginning,
opened the way for an apologia of the enterprising self, of self-initiative . . . if I may, personally
for myself, interpret his thinking as “cosmological
fact.” At the same time, the philosopher did not
fail to subordinate the liberty of Reason, whether
pure or practical, to a Cause, be it divine or
moral.
From this I extrapolate that, in a world
increasingly dominated by technology, liberty is
progressively becoming the faculty of adjusting to
a “cause,” still external to the self, but less and less
a moral cause and more and more an economic
one, or at best both of them together. In this line

199
of liberty, which manifests itself in the verbal
being through the presence of oneself to the
other and is quite distinct from liberalism. It is,
if anything, a liberalism of letting go.
The psychological and social connotations of
the liberty so defined are obvious. The poet is
its best exemplar. He is joined by the libertine,
who defies social cause-and-effect correctness to
express his dissident form of desire; also by the
transfer and counter-transfer of psychoanalysis;
and by the revolutionary, who sets the privileges
of the individual above any other convention.
This formed the base for Human Rights and the
French Revolution’s proclamation of LibertyEquality-Fraternity, which radically consolidated
the progress achieved by England’s Habeas Corpus.
If we manage to understand and interpret these
patterns, experiences, and lines of thinking, we shall
be better able to refuse a now-prevalent (especially
outside France) view of the eighteenth century
that confuses the Enlightenment’s legacy with
abstract universalism.
We are in the process of building the European Union, with all the familiar difficulties
and roadblocks that this entails. In this often
chaotic context, France’s call to establish a “social
Europe,” although sometimes not well heard,
elicits echoes from other governments and from
a public opinion wedded to its cultural tradition.
Our feeling is that we are proposing a model of
society that would not, or not entirely, be that
of the liberalism commonly associated with the
American model. The affirmation of our cultural
difference is founded on more than a memory and
a tradition assumed to be more ancient, refined,
and sophisticated, since proceeding from the Old
World; it flows from the conviction of having
that other notion of liberty, which gives priority
to being, singular being, over economic and
scientific necessity. When a French government,
whether representing the left or certain tendencies in the Gaullist right, insists on “solidarity”
opposite “liberalism,” it is in effect defending
this variant of liberty.
It is easy to discern the dangers in this attitude:
disregard for economic reality, withdrawal into
special-interest claims, abandonment of world
competition, retirement into indolence and, precisely, Old-Worldiness. This is why vigilance
is required and why the constraints of the technological, cause-and-effect world must not be

diversity and culture

of thought, favored by Protestantism – I refer
to Max Weber’s work on the links between
capitalism and Protestantism – liberty appears
as the freedom to adjust oneself to the logic of
cause and effect. Or, as Hannah Arendt said, to
the “calculation of consequences,” to the logic
of production, science, economics. Being free is
having the freedom to draw the best from adjusting to the chain of causes and effects, to adjust
to the market of production and profit.
Globalization and liberalism are the endproduct of this liberty, whereby you are free to
. . . start incorporating yourself into the causeand-effect chain. The Supreme Cause (the Deity)
and the Technical Cause (the Dollar) are the twin
variants, united and copresent, which guarantee
that working of our freedoms within this system,
which we might call the logic of instrumentalization. I do not deny the scope and benefits of
this form of liberty, adapted to the cause-and-effect
chain and culminating in a particular type of
thought, whose acme is scientific thinking, the
thought of calculation. It represents a crucial step
in the development of a humanity advancing
into technology, the free market, and automation.
American civilization is the one the best adapted
to that liberty. All that I am saying is that it is not
the only liberty that exists.
There is another model of liberty, which
appeared, wrapped in philosophy, in the world
of ancient Greece with the pre-Socratic thinkers
and developed through Socratic dialogue. This
other liberty is not subordinate to a Cause; it
precedes the concatenation of the Aristotelian
“categories,” which are themselves the premise of
scientific and technical reason. This fundamental freedom lies in Being, in the verbal being
who reveals and gives himself, who is present to
himself and to others and who in this sense frees
himself. This liberation of the verbal being by
and in the encounter between One and the Other
is brought to light in Heidegger’s discussion
of Kant’s philosophy (1930 Seminar, published
as “The Essence of Human Freedom”). The
task is to integrate this liberty of the surprising
encounter into philosophy’s essential core, as a
non-finite interrogation, before liberty becomes
attached, at a later stage, to the chain of cause and
effect and control over it.
It is important today, before the vista of the
modern world, to insist on this second conception

dominant / residual / emergent

200
overlooked. Yet the advantages of the other
model of liberty, today upheld by the European
nations, are evident. This other model, which is
more an aspiration than a firm project, is powered by a concern for human life where it is most
frailly singular, that of the poor, the disabled,
and the elderly – as well as respect for sexual and
ethnic differences – in their specific intimacy,
not only in their role as consumers.
Can we maintain this conception of singular
liberty for the whole of mankind? It is by no
means certain. Everything goes to show that on
this earth we are swept up in the maelstrom of
calculation-thought and material consumption.
The only counterpoise is a recrudescence of sects
and cults for which the sacred is not the “perpetual
quest” required by human dignity as I described
it earlier, but rather a submission to the same
cause-and-effect logic carried to the extreme – in
this case, the enslaving power of the sect or fundamentalist group. This is to say that the religious
alternative, when it degenerates into a clash
among fundamentalisms, instead of counterpointing technological dominance, acts as the exact
symmetrical twin of competition and conflictual
logic, which it reinforces.
In this respect, Europe is far from being consistent and united. The Iraq war and the terrorist threat have led some to observe that a chasm
separates “Old Europe” from “New Europe,” to
use their terms. Without venturing too far into
the complexities of this problem, I should like
to voice two opinions, perforce highly personal,
on the matter. First, it is essential that “Old
Europe,” France in particular, should take the
economic difficulties of “New Europe” very
seriously. These difficulties make these countries
especially dependent on the United States. It is also
necessary to recognize the cultural, and more
particularly religious, differences separating us
from these countries and learn better to respect
them. The famous “French arrogance” does not
really fit us for this task; and the Orthodox
peoples of Europe feel a certain bitterness at this
lack of understanding. On another front, Europe’s
knowledge of the Arab world, after the long
years of colonization, attunes us well to Islamic
culture. This enables us to temper, if not
completely avoid, the “clash of civilizations” to
which I alluded earlier. The European countries’
surreptitious anti-Semitism should, however,

keep us watchful as regards the rise of new forms
of anti-Semitic sentiment.
I purposely stressed the Greco-French origins
of the second model of liberty, which I treated
too briefly. Let it be clear that no one holds
a monopoly on it, and that Protestants and
Catholics alike have a rich potential in this field.
I should add that the notion of being “chosen”
in Judaism, while different from that of liberty,
makes someone belonging to that tradition
particularly suited to accomplishing precisely
what is out of our grasp, namely cross-fertilizing
the two versions of liberty: the “liberal” and the
“mutually supportive”; the “technical” and the
“poetic”; the “causal” and the “revelatory.”
Other civilizations contribute their own notions
of what constitutes a human being. Despite the
globalization at work, these have their place,
and indeed their diversity is a corrective for
globalization. Diversity in cultural models is the
sole guarantee of respect for a humanity that we
can describe only as “hospitality.” Technical and
robotic uniformization is clearly the quickest and
simplest way of stabbing it to death. But attention; hospitality should not be a mere juxtaposition of differences, with one model dominating
all the others. Quite the contrary, hospitality in
diversity requires appreciating other logics and
other liberties in order to render each system
more multiple and complex. Humanity, for which
I have yet to find a definition, is possibly a process of complexification.
Respect for Europe’s difference could be a
decisive step in this direction. We know the
adage of the French moralists, “If God did not
exist, we should have to invent it.” It is to the interest of our pluralist liberty, and it is to America’s
interest also – America, which sees itself as the
“Third Rome” of the globalized world, but also
perceives the repulsion provoked by this uniformization and its disastrous consequences.

extremism in various parts of the world is
another instance of residual forms challenging
the Hegemony of liberal Western capitalism.
Indeed, it could be argued that all ethnic and
religious identities are constructed through the process of keeping residual forms alive, expressing
Structures of feeling which the dominant
culture denies or represses.
Emergent cultures also develop in relation to
dominant formations, and in practice it can be
difficult to draw a clear line between residual
and emergent forms, for both often consist of private or marginalized spheres of experience which
the dominant culture initially fails to acknowledge
or recognize. For example, new social forces in
contemporary Western society – feminism, the
peace movement, and green politics – challenge both
the dominant culture and residual oppositional
forms such as the “traditional” labour movement, yet may themselves base their identities on
selective traditions, or on residual notions of
nature. Williams stresses that the dominant culture is itself dependent on incorporating aspects
of emergent forms to maintain its legitimacy
and hegemony, and that it is often difficult to
distinguish between what is genuinely emergent
and what is merely novel. The assimilation of
subcultural and subversive styles and fashions
into mainstream culture is one example of such
incorporation. Another is the way in which
critical movements, such as poststructuralism,
initially an emergent trend in opposition to
a residual/dominant literary Canon, have now
become a new dominant literary institution.

`double-consciousness 
A term central to
Black cultural studies, which was first articulated by W.E.B. Du Bois in The Souls of Black
Folk (1903). Expressing the acute disenchantment
of black intellectuals with post-Reconstruction
American society, Du Bois argued that all black

double-consciousness

explicitly in Marxism and Literature (1977),
though similar ideas about cultural power relationships and the processes of change can be
traced back to Culture and Society (1958). His
argument that a culture is composed of a set of
relations between dominant, residual, and emergent forms is a way of emphasizing the uneven
and dynamic quality of any particular moment.
It represents a shift away from more monumental epochal analyses of history in the manner
of Hegel and Lukács, where periods or stages
of history succeed one another and each epoch
is characterized by a dominant mode or spirit
of the times. Williams argued that it is possible
to make general distinctions between different
periods of history based on modes of production
between “feudal” and “bourgeois,” for example,
or “capitalist” and “late capitalist.” However,
he pointed out that these dominant formations
are in themselves too broad and need to be further broken down into differentiated moments.
Moreover, each epoch not only consists of different
variations and stages, but at every point is also
composed of a process of dynamic, contradictory
relationships in the interplay of dominant,
residual, and emergent forms. This opens up
a space to analyze the role that subversive
and oppositional identities and movements play
within the dominant culture, and how effective
they might be in shifting it.
Neither residual nor emergent forms simply
exist within or alongside the dominant culture.
They operate in a process of continual tension,
which can take the form of both incorporation
and opposition within it. Residual forms are
different from archaic ones in that they are still
alive, they have use and relevance within contemporary culture. They represent a previous
institution or tradition which is still active as
a memory in the present, and thus can both
bolster the dominant culture or provide the
resources for an alternative or opposition to it.
In Britain the monarchy could be seen as a residual institution that is gradually being perceived
as archaic within popular discourse as it loses
its cultural legitimacy. Conversely, the current
ethnic and nationalist conflicts in the former
Yugoslavia and Soviet Republics can be seen as
an example of residual identities challenging
and overturning former dominant ones, though
not in progressive ways. The rise of religious

Americans suffer from a sense of doubleconsciousness, or conflict between their black
and American cultural identities. Caused by the
enforced exclusion of blacks from mainstream
American society at the turn of the century,
this self-division obstructs the development of
authentic self-consciousness, for it compels black
Americans to regard and evaluate their black
identities through the lens of the dominant white
culture. Although Du Bois’s formulation of this
dilemma has been criticized (for reflecting a sense
of cultural Alienation produced by Du Bois’s
intellectual training at elite American educational
institutions), the concept of double-consciousness
has continued to resonate and exert considerable
analytical power in contemporary discussions of
the mixed cultural identity of Afro-Americans.

`Douglas, Mary Tew (1921–2007) 
British
social anthropologist. She is known for her studies of religion and symbolism, pollution and
moral order, her ethnography of the Lele of the
Kasai, and for Group/grid analysis. She was
one of the leaders of neostructuralism in British
anthropology in the 1960s, along with Edmund
Leach, Rodney Needham, and Victor Turner.
This Paradigm meant a shift away from the
previous focus on norms and actions to an interest in symbolic systems. Mary Douglas derived
her interest in the sociology of religion from
her education at the Sacred Heart Convent in
Roehampton. She subsequently studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford, and then
developed an interest in Africa and in anthropology
during her job in the Colonial Office 1943–6. She
took a BSc in anthropology in Oxford in 1948,
where she studied with Evans-Pritchard. She did
fieldwork in Zaire (then the Belgian Congo)
1949–50 and again in 1953, and received her PhD
in 1951. Her dissertation, published as The Lele
of the Kasai, has become a classic of ethnography.
In the course of a distinguished academic
career, she has authored many books and articles,
and coauthored or edited others. She taught for
many years at the University of London, retiring
with a full professorship in 1978. In 1977 she

moved to the United States, serving as resident
scholar and director at the Russell Sage Foundation, then teaching at Northwestern University
till 1985, and at Princeton till 1988.
Douglas’s studies of pollution brought her
original fame. In Purity and Danger she investigates rituals of purity and impurity, analyzes the
significance of dirt and cleanliness in daily life, and
examines the social basis for pollution beliefs. She
is interested in looking at boundaries and their
ritual affirmation. In Natural Symbols and some
of her other writings, she links Culture and
society and relates social organization to cosmology. In her symbolic analysis, she focuses less on
the meaning of Symbols than on their patterns
and Structures and the relations between them.
Her investigations of the nature of classification
systems have led to other concerns, such as the
study of food as the means to decode systems of
social information. She shows that the choices
people make about what they eat and how they
prepare and present food reflect the organization
of social life. Menus can be looked at in terms
of categories and opposites: meals contrast with
drinks, solids with liquids. In this way the structure
of meals can be likened to the structure of myths.
She is also known for her methodology of
Group/grid analysis for classifying social relations in order to compare different cultures and
their social organization. Her more recent work
moves to a broader examination of contemporary
society, contrasting modern culture with its predecessors and discussing its evolution. Among her
coauthored books, The World of Goods investigates
the communicative role of economic goods,
and the ways individuals reaffirm status through
consumption. Another investigates pollution in
American industrial society and the growth of the
environmental protection movement.

`Durkheim, Emile (1858–1917) 
French social
theorist. Recently a friend and I were hiking
along a well-established trail in a state park. At
the trail-head a sign announced that the trail was
restricted to hikers and that no bicycles were
allowed. Further on we encountered a couple of
youngsters tearing along on bicycles. My friend
shouted out that bicycles were not allowed. The
cyclists looked sheepish and rode on. My friend’s
protest nicely illustrates the collective consciousness, a central concept around which Emile
Durkheim built much of his theory of society.
Emile Durkheim clearly ranks among the
foremost social theorists of all time for both
sociology and anthropology. Writing and teaching at the end of the nineteenth century and the
beginning of the twentieth, Durkheim succeeded
in focusing both fields centrally on group-level
social phenomena – social institutions and culture

respectively – and in providing both fields with
a firm self-identity as a science with practical
applications. These ideas had occurred to earlier
writers, but Durkheim had global influence owing
to the elegance of his analysis, the brilliance of his
writing and lecturing, the breadth of his scholarship, and his lifelong commitment to reshaping
social investigation into a new scholarly enterprise.
Son of a long line of Jewish rabbis, Durkheim
himself initially planned to study for the rabbinate.
These expectations were put aside, however, as
his studies moved to philosophy, metaphysics,
and other subjects. He sought admission to the
prestigious Ecole Normale Supérieure, preparing for a career as a teacher, and was admitted.
There he was influenced particularly by the
philosopher Boutroux, noted for his critiques of
scientific argumentation, and by the historian
Foustel de Coulanges, whose focus on the development of social forms became his own. The
writing of Comte and Spencer provided much of
the specific body of social thought upon which
Durkheim was to construct his own sociology.
While he disagreed with Comte’s view in many
respects, Durkheim took from Comte the proposition that society could be analyzed by the
methods of science (Comte proposed the term
“sociology” for this), and that the conclusions
could be used to construct an improved society.
He was also to disagree sharply with Spencer, but
he adopted Spencer’s general evolutionary scheme
for social progress, and Spencer’s assumption
that societies were organized as social Systems.
Durkheim proposed a new conception of the
relationship between individuals and their society. Here he disagreed with Comte, who, with
many others, assumed that social consensus and
loyalty were the summation of the sentiments of
the member individuals and that society as an
aggregation derived from individuals. This necessarily led to the conclusion that social norms
have to be taken into account as a reflection of
interests individuals have in common. Psychological, biological, and economic incentives were
among the sources examined for laws, customs,
and values held in common. Durkheim argued,
on the other hand, that society constituted a separate level of reality. Societies were social systems
that had their own imperatives, especially to
maintain a working whole. To a large extent, the
attitudes and interests of individuals stem from

Durkheim, Emile

the raw materials of a dream (classically defined
as a form of wish fulfillment) into its Manifest
content. The raw material of a dream may
include dream-thoughts, physical stimuli, childhood memories, allusions to the Transference
situation and the day’s residues, or in other words,
elements from the waking life of the previous day
that appear in the dream. The principal operations of the dream-work are Condensation/
displacement and secondary revision; it is
also governed by conditions of representability.
Secondary revision rearranges the dream in such
a way as to generate a relatively consistent and
coherent scenario; conditions of representability govern the selection and transformation of
dream-thoughts into visual images. The overall
effect of the dream-work is distortion: although
the manifest content is relatively coherent, it is
difficult to recognize the latent elements contained within it. The latent content of a dream can
be recovered only through interpretation. Freud
(1900; 1901) stresses that the dream-work is not
a creative process, but one which merely transforms
material. It is the dream-work and not the Latent
content that is the essence of the dream.

Durkheim, Emile

the society in which they live. Thus social patterns
can be analyzed quite apart from the psychological, economic, and personal characteristics of
individuals.
To analyze social systems Durkheim proposed
two conceptual tools. The first was the “social fact.”
Durkheim did not argue that social facts were
empirical objects, as he is sometimes misread,
but an intellectual device allowing scientific
methods of investigation to be applied to social
phenomena. The key criterion of a social fact
was that it had “coercive effect” over individuals.
Where that was true, Durkheim argued, analysis
could proceed as thought it were a real object.
When my friend admonished the cyclists, she
illustrated the second of Durkheim’s conceptual
tools, collective conscience. Durkheim proposed
that the social identity of individuals transcends
the aggregate of individual interests and psychologies. Comprising both intellectual and moral
dimensions, the collective conscience links individuals to the social systems, shapes their desires,
conforms their behavior to the common good, and
follows its own path of development.
Durkheim invested much effort in studying
societies of different types, a cross-cultural
enterprise that brought his work to the attention
of anthropologists. He discerned that the solidarity
of a social system was differently constituted
for small, traditional societies compared with
large, complex ones. In small societies individuals shared similar bodies of information and
interests, and performed similar roles in society.
Sanctions in these societies were geared to ensuring conformity. Using a term that has confused
readers for generations, Durkheim called this
form of solidarity “mechanical solidarity.” When
populations grew larger and societies more densely
settled, a necessary division of labor developed
and the social system was integrated around
complementary roles for individuals. Using an
organismic model, Durkheim termed the basis of
these systems “organic solidarity,” where groups
of individuals would have different interests
and sectors of the system would function in

complementary ways. Law in these societies was
“restitutive,” functioning to ensure that the interdependencies of distinct sectors remained viable.
Among his many published writings, three
books are central. In Division of Labor (1893) he
set out most of his analysis of society. In Suicide
(1897) he shows that what seems to be an
entirely individual-based event is demonstrably a
predictable response to social, systematic factors.
In Elementary Forms of the Religion Life (1912)
Durkheim points to the focal place that religion plays in maintaining the social system and
solidarity of individuals. This book, situated in
a case analysis of Australian Totemism, is the
culmination of Durkheim’s life-long analytical
enterprise and his most complex analysis. Taken
together, his works strongly influenced many
who succeeded him. Among those who developed
major bodies of theory upon a foundation of
Durkheim’s work are, notably, Talcott Parsons in
sociology, A.R. Radcliffe-Brown and Claude Lévistrauss in anthropology, and Marcel Mauss
who straddled both fields.
Emile Durkheim has been accused of blocking the proper exploration of psychological,
historical, and economic factors, and the role of
the individual in shaping society. In truth, however, social science is built around an interplay
of system-level analysis and individual, external
factors. For both sociology and anthropology
Durkheim is the anchor point for system-based
explanations and the classic statement of the
concomitants of that approach.

E

`Eagleton, Terry (1943–) 
British critic, novelist, and playwright. Terry Eagleton is doubtless the
most widely read Marxist critic now writing in
English. He appears to have systematically and successfully defied the usual social and professional
British class boundaries in a way that has contributed to his work. His many publications
include a number of small pamphlet-size books
– such as Criticism and Ideology (1976), Marxism
and Literary Criticism (1976), The Function of
Criticism (1984), and The Significance of Theory
(1990) – which have all reached a wide audience.
But he has also written several more detailed
books for what is still a substantial readership.
These include Walter Benjamin (1981), Literary
Theory: An Introduction (1983), and Ideology of
the Aesthetic (1990). In his inaugural lecture as
Warton Professor, Eagleton (1993, p. 19) repeated
a note that he has sounded throughout all of his
recent criticism:
If . . . everything just goes on as it is, English
studies can abandon an illusion that they have
anything of significance to say to those outside
the charmed circle of academia. And if this
comes about, then it will represent a profound
betrayal of their own finest traditions. For all the
greatest moments of English criticism . . . have
been points at which, in speaking of the literary
work, criticism has found itself unavoidably
speaking of more than it – found itself, indeed,

mapping the deep structures and central directions of an entire culture.

His commitment is clearly to the transformative
powers of critical literary study.

`ecocriticism 
Ecocriticism, also known as
literary ecology or environmental literary studies,
is a field of criticism that emerged in the late
twentieth century as a slightly delayed response
in the humanities to the global emergence of the
environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s.
Together with environmental philosophy and
environmental history, and to some extent studies of place, space, and landscape, it forms the
core of what in the early twenty-first century is
an emerging cross-disciplinary field of environmental humanities. That spectrum of studies
subverts twentieth-century paradigms of discrete
liberal arts institutional divisions, in resistance to
the growth of more quantitative-based professional
and interdisciplinary programs in policy, planning,
and environmental sciences. As such, while ecocriticism may seem a bridge between the “two
cultures” of academia, it can in some ways also

ecocriticism

206
represent an attempted resurgence of a qualitative
tradition of liberal arts, based often in an implicit critique of scientific complicity in massive
degradation of the world’s physical environment
during the past two centuries.
Lawrence Buell of Harvard, a leading senior
scholar in the field, at a 2009 conference on
“Environmental Imaginations” at Susquehanna
University, defined ecocriticism in general terms
as up-ending a traditional quasi-Aristotelian
fourfold framework for reading literature (plot,
characterization, theme and setting) by refocusing it around setting, the element most often
neglected in Western criticism. Yet Buell and
others in their writings also make clear how
ecocriticism does this richly through probing the
relation between physical and social contexts
and text as a continuum of textual setting, while
often drawing on a complex definition of “nature”
in debt to Martin Heidegger’s view of phusis as
that which both appears and hides simultaneously. This is often done to subversively re-read
power relations in stories by interweaving contexts
and setting.
In the primary ecocritical journal ISLE (which
in 2009 became housed at Oxford University
Press, symbolizing growing scholarly recognition
of the field), and elsewhere, practitioners have
moved beyond a first wave of criticism related
closely to the late twentieth-century philosophical movements of deep ecology (as developed
by Arne Naess) and ecofeminism (articulated by
Val Plumwood). Increasingly ecocriticism, while
often still connected to those roots, attempts to
build complex engagements of texts with concerns
of environmental social justice, neocolonialism/
globalization, and “posthumanities”/“postnature”
studies. These involve an increasingly diverse
array of literatures ranging beyond the field’s initially heavy North Atlantic and Western US focus
on English Romanticism, American Transcendentalism, twentieth-century Anglo-American
nature writing, and American Indian literature.
In the process, ecocritics continue efforts to
develop their field as a theoretical approach as well
as a way of reading, focusing on setting as a pretext for studying the interplay of environmental
and social contexts, including how texts themselves
can be understood as serving an environmental
function in human development and exploitation
of the world and other beings. In this sense, in a

much more sophisticated way than understood
by some of its critics, ecocriticism has begun to
explore comprehensively issues of how text and
the subjectivity of both author and reader can
be seen as emerging in a kind of “nature-text.”
Ecocritics at gatherings such as the biennial
North American conference of the Association for
the Study of Literature and the Environment
(ASLE, which sponsors ISLE), increasingly are
looking at environmental phenomenology and
semiotic studies based in Charles Peirce’s sign
theory, as well as into globalization studies under
the “eco-cosmopolitanism” banner of Stanford’s
Ursula Heise (a rising star in the movement), seen
in her field-redefining book Sense of Place, Sense
of Planet (2008).
Nonetheless the current financial collapse of
neoliberal globalization and challenges to higher
education’s own “bubble” likely will reinvigorate
localist and regionalist approaches, rooted in
Wendell Berry’s “new agrarianism” and the sustainable economics of philosophers such as E.F.
Schumacher, tracing back to Heidegger’s environmental writings on region. In trying to steer
clear of allegations of ecofascism in their localist
tendencies, such approaches will likely intensify
efforts to articulate an “ecopoetics” engaging
developments in neuroscience with environmental phenomenology, as in the writings of
Toronto philosopher Evan Thompson, linking
also to work on ecosemiotics emanating from
Tartu University.
Through such efforts, some ecocritics see their
field contributing significantly to redefining critical theory in a “post-theory” era, through a literal
grounding of theory across previous abstracting
of humanities from the sciences. But in any
case the field’s concern with placing cultural
and social narratives of what is “natural” at the
center of interpretation has opened significant
opportunities for modern Western criticism to
engage less condescendingly with “pansemiotic”
nature-texts and art from indigenous and premodern cultures, which regard nature itself as
a system of signs with its own semiotics apart
from conceptualized codes of human sciences.
Recent interest by environmental activists and
organizations in the relevance of cultural imagination, narratives, and storytelling to realizing
the inherent value of non-human being and
ensuring human care for a region (for example,

207
Buell in his foundational The Environmental
Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the
Formation of American Culture (1995) developed
a set of criteria for identifying texts that cue the
reader into a more “ecocentric” or nature-centered
literary experience. The use of such criteria reflects
the influence of Phenomenology on Readerreception theory, while also embracing explanations of such cues based in Postcolonial/
neocolonial theory and New historicism, building on work on literary and cultural landscape
by figures such as Raymond Williams, W.J.T.
Mitchell, and (in terms of the simulacra-landscape
of global capitalism) the Deleuze-influenced
team of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. As
picked up by the “second wave” of ecocriticism,
such analyses of power relations in connection
with textual shapings and reflections of nature
extend ecocritical analysis into areas beyond
Euroamerican- and North American-centered
textual traditions, to work on Caribbean, African,
Asian, and African-American cultures, including, for example, ecocritical study of the works
of Toni Morrison. The 2009 ASLE Book Award
for Ecocriticism was awarded to Paul Outka for
his book Race and Nature from Transcendentalism to the Harlem Renaissance (2008), which
addresses interconnections of race and nature.
Outka’s study discusses the sublime and race,
related to transcendentalism, abolitionism, and the
pastoral, within contexts of slavery, reconstruction, “Strange Fruit,” and white flight. Typical
of the field, the book uses a mix of theoretical
approaches with a strong historical context,
exemplifying in the words of one reviewer
how ecocriticism can “begin to embrace the true
complexity of the American landscape.”
Place-centered phenomenologically based work
by the geographer Yi-Fu Tuan (see Cultural
landscape in a globalizing world) represents
an important area of overlap between landscape
studies, human geography, and concerns with
normative values of sustainability in ecocriticism, implicit in the latter’s search for authentic
human development, or what Naess termed a
self-realization that is neither selfish nor altruistic but emergent in environmental relationships.
Some ecocritics today regard notions of the
“natural” as outdated in explorations of “posthumanities,” as in the related emerging fields of
animal studies and cyborg theory. But a dynamic

ecocriticism

the Conservation Fund’s interest in the development of designated historic corridors around the
Chesapeake Bay) ensures expanding support for
ecocritical approaches in the foreseeable future.
This is counteracted, however, by fundamental
tensions within environmental studies between
quantitative and qualitative approaches, and the
unsure footing of ecocriticism in conventional
departmental and divisional categories of the
academy.
An example of ecocritical analysis in its fairly
new extension to non-modern literatures highlights
the contrast between early Irish and Anglo-Saxon
views of an ancestral spiritual Otherworld in
nature, and hence the relation of human societies
to the physical world and cultural constructions of human subjectivity and the “natural”
(Siewers, 2009). In Beowulf, the natural world of
the Grendelcyn’s mere is a place described in
terms borrowed from hellish religious allegory.
The inhabitants of this natural realm are human
descendants of Cain but also monsters, probably
identifiable to Anglo-Saxon audiences with nonGermanic native inhabitants of Britain. The hero
Beowulf becomes well defined as a teleological
individual in opposition to monsters of the wetlands and earlier of the sea. By contrast, in the
perhaps roughly contemporary Immram Brain,
or The Voyage of Bran, an early Irish narrative
portrays the sea as an otherworldly realm both contiguous with Ireland (and overlapping it through
other elemental and topographical interactions
expressed in various early Irish texts) and in a
sense encompassing it, with a respected mode of
time of its own different from human concerns.
Bran’s engagement with the external environment
shapes his figure in the story, rather than his
opposition to it. Such analysis engages in a focus
on setting that morphs into historical, social,
source-study, and philological contextualization,
examining differing colonial, racial, and theological situations of alternative early Christian
literary cultures. It suggests how certain textual
traditions such as that of Immram Brain can
highlight a non-allegorical and iconographic view
of desire, selfhood, and symbolism, essentially
a “non-Western” view (by later standards), in
which desire is relational rather than a condition
of lack, following on the “geophilosophy” of
Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, which also
informs aspects of ecocritical theorizing.

ecocriticism

208
sense of nature in which the human is implicated
(a “real” with which, however apophatically, the
embodied human mind must come to terms at
least in relation to social ethics and mortality)
remains a strong element of most ecocritical
projects, related to continuing activist connections
of the field, its engagement with indigenous and
now premodern traditions, and its connections
with phenomenology.
In part this has been addressed through a phenomenological sensibility in line with Heidegger’s
observation that what we see often is in a sense
our ideas, an actual that is not real. To achieve
a paradoxically “virtual real” involves trying to
establish a more personal and experiential sense
of reality apart from more abstract theoretical constructs of Western Scholasticism and modernity,
and this is achievable through certain types and
approaches of narrative. Erazim Kohák’s The
Embers and the Stars (1984), from what is sometimes called the Czech school of phenomenology,
articulates an early ecocritical quest for human
realization in nature. Its phenomenological exegesis (and ultimate normative embrace) of the
Jewish biblical text of the Ten Commandments
in environmental terms parallels some ecocritical
ethical concerns with deep ecological notions
of self-realization in the environment. Works of
Edward S. Casey mark a more comprehensive
application of phenomenology to environmental
concerns, considering (in terms of place) writings
by critical theorists including Jacques Derrida and
Luce Irigaray. Casey defines place by extending Heidegger’s fourfold into a “happening”
intersection of cosmology and cosmogony in
personal experience. Place-landscape is a regional
field of such narrative intersections. Irigaray’s
elemental sense of a double-folded femaleness
as the basis of such a landscape, both contained
and containing, provides an alternative to the
modern generic universal grid of “space,” cognitively controlled and interiorized by the human
mind. Casey’s gloss of Irigaray provides another
significant analogue-basis for ecocritical theory.
They share parallel concerns with place as a
relational mode of life threatened by modern
constructions of space emerging from a paradoxical merger of the transcendent and the interiorized in the anthropology of modern science.
Casey’s explicating of active and passive memory
in relation to experience of time highlights the

importance of textual highlighting of multiplicitous and simultaneous modes of temporality in
“ecocentric” texts, exemplified in the American
Indian writer Linda Hogan’s novel Solar Storms.
Active memory involves an experience of multiple
temporal realities, rather than Augustine’s “eternal present” possessed by the transcendental
subject.
Narratives such as Hogan’s that highlight
dynamic boundaries of human and non-human
temporalities of time and non-time, and overlapping diverse cultural and personal temporalities
within human experience, exhibit what ecophenomenologist David Wood (in his essay
“What is eco-phenomenology?” in the collection
Eco-Phenomenology; Brown and Toadvine, 2003)
calls “time-plexity.” In certain ways this notion of
time-plexity parallels premodern or non-modern
experiences of time, such as the early-medieval/
patristic sense of simultaneous entwined layers
of human social time, non-human natural cycles
of time, the eternal time of non-corporeal and
spiritual but created beings (such as angels and
demons), and the everlasting uncreated “nontime” of divinity. In such time-plexity, human
narrative control or possession of an objectified
nature is impossible. In Hogan’s twentiethcentury fiction, the reality of Indian family and
cultural memories form a different temporality
from that of the linear time of whites, which
ignores also cycles of natural time and a temporality of a spiritual realm entwined with it and
traditions. Attentiveness to that time-plexity in the
novel empowers resistance to corporate cultural
and environmental domination through imaginative revival of engagement with alternative
indigenous traditions that enables activism. Nor
is such non-modern time-plexity confined to
indigenous writings of the past century. Peter
Hallward in his critique of Deleuze and Guattari
notes the surprising affinity between their notion
of “bodies without organs” or a virtual real
(desire as relational rather than objectifying),
and views of nature as theophanic in the work
of the early Irish patristic writer John Scottus
Eriugena, whose definition of nature as including
non-being and the divine articulates a worldview
in sync with Celtic stories of the Otherworld that
formed a basis for what Northrop Frye called the
“green world” of later English literature, such as
A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

209
towards renewed examination of the human
being as in effect a psychosomatic and “extraorganismic” ecosystem. Ramifications of this
for textual studies in the unfolding first half of
the twenty-first century are likely to involve
increased explorations of possible connections
of ecocritical theory to multidimensional frames
of physics from quantum mechanics to the
anthropic principle.
But at the moment perhaps the most fertile field
for new development of ecocritical theory lies
in its potential relations with ecosemiotics, an
offshoot of the also-young field of biosemiotics,
which has been centered mainly to date in a few
European universities, notably the former-Soviet
and now-Estonian semiotic studies center of
Tartu. Ecosemiotics looks at the cultural aspects
of signs as an environmental phenomenon. As such
it focuses on Peirce’s concern with the relations
of the sign to both object (environment) and
meaning (formation of both writer and author in
the text). Wendy Wheeler’s The Whole Creature:
Complexity, Biosemiotics, and the Evolution of
Culture (2006) provides a good introduction,
but articles by Winfried Nöth, Kalevi Kull, and
Timo Maran are foundational.
From a longue durée perspective, the developing
field of ecocriticism highlights the potential both
for further reassessment of Western intellectual
and social history in a global context, and for new
coalitions on environmental and related issues
between different non-modern worldviews globally. Through its distinctive focus and meld
of theoretical approaches, ecocriticism suggests
that the great watershed in the construction of
nature by Western culture was neither so much
the Renaissance nor the spread of Christianity,
but the normatizing of a reality of individual
human interiority from the twelfth-century
Renaissance onward. In developments of the era
of the Crusades and Scholasticism, it suggests, lie
the emergence of what became global modernity, which can be seen as having a more direct
complicity than previously often assumed with
the medieval in Western European culture as
the latter morphed into global capitalism and
scientism.

ecocriticism

A static ecological sense of climax communities as a normative basis for literary ecology is at
odds with emphases of science in the later twentieth century, and this has spurred the search
for an understanding of relational dynamics as
supporting the ethical framework that remains
an important strand in ecocriticism. In this the
importance of time-plexity is related to notions
of environmental empathy as narrative ecopoesis (Thompson, 2007). Ecopoesis in ecophenomenology can be understood as a type of
cultural textuality in which the autopoesis of the
individual’s shaping of environment becomes
linked developmentally into a broader empathetic
sense of dynamic ecosystem within larger contexts.
Ecopoesis (sometimes spelled ecopoiesis) as a
literal shaping of ecosystems in this sense can be
defined in terms of both the role of narratives
(as in how Enlightenment texts shaped the rightangled property landscape of the central portion
of North America today, via Thomas Jefferson’s
writings), and processes of physical shaping of
ecosystems through scientifically inspired efforts
such as ecological restoration, which often rely
on early texts about landscape. The very term
ecopoesis evokes the recognition in ecocriticism of the biological role of human beings as
storytelling and poetic beings, or “mythopoetic
subcreators” as put by J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien’s
popular fiction, in its central depiction of
nature stemming from mid-twentieth-century
social contexts, highlights yet another focus of
contemporary ecocriticism, which increasingly
includes fantasy and science fiction genres and an
expanded definition of texts to include categories
such as anime and virtual-reality media.
Although many ecocritics have embraced evolutionary theory wholeheartedly in their approach
to narrative as human environmental adaptation,
resistance to hegemonic Darwinism or NeoDarwinism as both anthropocentric and ethnocentric is also reflected in the field, echoing
Gregory Bateson’s comment that rather than
focusing on the organism versus the environment,
ecological cultural studies needed to focus on
the organism within the environment (related to
Thompson’s “neurophenomenological” notion of
environmental empathy and the role of ecopoesis). Such emphases place aspects of ecocriticism
potentially in line with Thompson’s critique of
Richard Dawkins’s “genocentrism,” in a trend

`ecology 
The term “ecology” is rooted in the
Greek word oikos. In pre-Socratic thought this term
is defined as “the whole house,” that is, the unity
of nature and the sciences. Nature was understood
to be permeated by the mind and was, therefore,
thought to be alive, intelligent, and rational.
Moreover, nature (animals, plants, etc.) was held
to participate in the intellectual development
of the world. Humans were a part of this nature
and had no intention to dominate or control.
Nature was in a state of totality, developing
in a cycle in which all things were related to
and dependent on each other. Despite the constant challenge by theology, this totality of
nature formed and remained the basic economic
and social structure for all agrarian societies
throughout the Middle Ages. The Alienation of
humankind from nature first entered a critical stage
during the age of European bourgeois Enlightenment in the eighteenth century. The result was
the advancement of the principles of the market
economy and technology, both theoretically
based on “objective-scientific” methodology.
Bourgeois liberation from feudal suppression
began in England and France as early as the late
seventeenth century. These developments were
based partly on a positive view of nature in which
the bourgeoisie saw itself as the dynamic class,
capable of changing society. This evolutionary
process also led to the recognition of the Great

Chain of Being, which should never be broken,
as Alexander Pope wrote in his Essay on Man
(1735). Such ecological insights were reflected in
two major changes after 1750 which were based
on the slogan of the impending French Revolution: “liberty, equality, fraternity.” Baroque garden
concepts were replaced with principles based on
the ideal of nature, and a first attempt was made
to establish animal rights.
Gardens and garden concepts must be understood as a reaction to the massive clearcutting of
forests in France in the latter part of the eighteenth
century. The attempt to redefine the relation
between nature, Culture, and society invoked the
hope for the possibility of humans recognizing
themselves as a part of the order in nature.
Humans should find their place in nature as
in a garden, as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and
others stressed in their writings. The garden was
understood to be an ideal landscape in which
interventions into nature and its suppression by
humans should not be visible; the landscape
reflected the multiplicity, the simplicity, and
thus the totality of nature. Based on such concepts,
gardens were thought to convey the meaning of
liberty, thereby enabling humans to place themselves within the quietness and the harmony
of nature. In addition, revolutionaries such as
Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Morelly combined
the economic use of forests with political freedom
from an ecological perspective.
Liberty trees were special Symbols at public
celebrations of the revolution. These trees represented the cycle of nature and were to function
as a guide for a society within nature. A very
special liberty tree was the oak tree, which
mirrored the overcoming of societal resistance
by nature. Accordingly, all local trees were seen
as symbolizing the principle of equality, while
exotic trees illustrated the principle of brotherhood. In order to move such ideal concepts into
a more practical realm, newly wedded couples were
first to plant 100 trees and thereby prove their
responsibility for the future of society.
In addition, programs for the reforestation
of large areas were also supposed to contribute
to the welfare of the public and to correct the
destructive forces of clearcutting. The goal of all
these activities and plans was to overcome the
contrasts between the City and the countryside
and change France into a big garden city. On the

211
Such descriptions, however insightful, had
no impact on overall economic developments.
More successful were animal rights activists,
including writers and philosophers such as Percy
Bysshe Shelley, Jean-Antoine Gleizès, and Arthur
Schopenhauer. Several “vegetarian societies”
were founded in England and France in the early
nineteenth century and several laws were passed
prohibiting cruelty to animals. These attempts
finally reached a broader public toward the end
of the nineteenth century when such well-known
individuals as John Ruskin, Robert Browning,
Mark Twain, George Bernard Shaw, Richard
Wagner, Charles Darwin, Henry S. Salt, and
H.G. Wells protested against vivisection or
wrote books and essays in which they embraced
vegetarianism.
Within the political and economic development
of the bourgeoisie a renewed interest in ecological concepts unfolded in Germany, England, and
the United States around 1850. Such perceptions
were noted in the works of Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl
(Natural History of the German People, 1851–69),
Charles Darwin (On the Origin of Species by
Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of
Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, 1859), and
George Perkins Marsh (Man and Nature, 1864).
While Riehl hoped to stop the process of industrialization and urbanization by recommending
a return to an agrarian-feudalist society, March,
noting the degree of pollution and destruction
of the East Coast of the United States, argued
for a government-organized, rational approach to
natural resources. Darwin, on the other hand,
was hoping for a predominance of altruism over
egotistic desires. His book, however, was understood mostly and especially by social Darwinists
as an interpretation of the principles of market
economy, competition, and progress. Equally
well known were the concepts of monism, based
on both Darwin’s evolutionism and a romantic
pantheism. The German monist intellectual
Ernst Haeckel became world famous and in his
General Morphology of Organisms (1866) was the
first to define ecology as the various relations
of animals and plants to one another and to the
outer world.
Industrialization and urbanization in the nineteenth century in Europe and North America
similarly led to ecological insights among the
theoreticians of socialism. While Karl Marx had

ecology

one hand this city was to reflect valuable artwork
within the concepts of revolutionary art determined by its usefulness; on the other hand the
beauty of the garden city was to be enhanced by
landscaping and parks. Such architectural concepts,
as well as the lifestyle that was to be realized in
this city, were seen as ecological. Furthermore,
it was hoped that such concepts would spread
revolutionary goals to the countryside.
In the same manner that revolutionaries
rejected aristocratic luxury parks as parasitic,
antisocial, and destructive; they also argued for
the equality of all animals. In order to regain the
liberty and dignity of animals caged in by the
ruling class, the notion of usefulness was stressed
again. Since animals experienced the same pain
and the same suffering as humans, animals had
to become their true partners. The general admiration for animals culminated in the demand that
animals were to be kept in open-air enclosures.
In England liberal voices were raised postulating
equal rights not only for pets but for all animals,
for example, in On the Duty of Mercy and Sin of
Cruelty to Brute Animals (1761) by Humphrey
Primatt and The Cry of Nature, or An Appeal
to Mercy and Justice on Behalf of the Persecuted
Animals (1797) by John Oswald. Some even went
so far as to regard the hunting, slaughtering, and
eating of animals as cannibalism.
However, these ecological concepts failed.
Instead, the principles of a “free market economy”
described by Adam Smith in his book Enquiry
on the Nature and the Causes of the Wealth of
Nations (1776) prospered. Thus ecological concepts moved to the background at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, when the bourgeoisie
saw liberation into capitalism as its primary goal.
Enlightenment concepts in regard to nature
were still found in works by Alexander von
Humboldt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry
David Thoreau. In Views of Nature (1808)
Humboldt vividly described the unity of nature
on the American continent, commenting on the
abundance of animals and plants in their geographical, geological, and biological variety, and
stressing the pristine character of nature still
untouched by economic developments. Despite the
obvious religious implications in such works,
nature was presented in the form of an ecological totality, which would enable humankind to
return to a primordial state.

praised capitalism as the only revolutionary force
within modern developments in the 1840s, he
later had doubts about the capitalist means of
production when he noticed the economic and
social conditions in England in the 1850s and
1860s. In Capital (1867) he wrote that capitalism constituted the overexploitation not only
of the worker but also of natural resources.
Consequently, he saw the circulation of matter
between the soil and humans as the only possibility for a lasting fertility of the soil and nature
in general. In his opinion, capitalist production
developed the technology and the combination of
a variety of social processes only to exploit all original sources of wealth: the soil and the laborer.
Along the same lines, Friedrich Engels wrote in
his Dialectics of Nature (1871 (1973)) that every
victory over nature at the same time meant a loss
with unforeseeable and unknown consequences.
While Marx and Engels did not speculate about
the future of socialism, other artists and writers
such as Peter Kropotkin and William Morris
did. Kropotkin’s Fields, Factories and Workshops
Tomorrow (1899) was based on the notion of
anarchism to establish an ecological future, and
served as a practical model for North American
and European communists and anarchosyndicalists such as Gustav Landauer, Bertrand
Russell, and Heinrich Vogeler well into the
1920s. Morris, on the other hand, in his novel News
from Nowhere (1890), designed a blueprint of an
ideal socialist society free of all class differences
as well as all forms of exploitation. Morris’s
concept of ecology was most striking in his
definition of beauty, which he understood as the
most powerful and most positive tool against the
ugliness of planned obsolescence in consumer
society.
In the United States, which by the early 1880s
after a period of unleashed economic growth
had replaced England as the largest industrial
power, individuals such as John Muir noted the
effects of economic “progress” on nature. In his
most popular book, Our National Parks (1901),
in which he paid tribute to Emerson, Thoreau, and
Charles Sprague Sargent, he wrote that, while the
beauty of nature still existed, it was also extremely
endangered by industrialization, urbanization,
and farming. To overcome the devastation caused
by the utilitarian forces of the industry, Muir
argued for a government-organized administration

of the forests, as well as for the preservation of
nature within the National Park System, which
had been established in 1872. However, Muir’s
strong religious worshipping of nature prevented
the public from understanding the political implications of his recommendations.
While William Morris, like many utopian
thinkers around 1900, saw socialism as the only
political force which would enable the coherence
of social interchange prescribed by the natural laws
of life, the German petty bourgeois Heimatschutz
(“protection of homeland”) movement must be
understood as a reaction against both socialism
and capitalism. Between 1880 and 1914 teachers,
authors, and civil servants published a large
number of essays and books that described vividly
the consequences of rapid industrialization and
urbanization in Germany: widespread pollution
of water and air, the clearcutting of forests, and
the devastation caused by tourism and billboards.
When the Heimatschutz organization was founded
in 1904 it demanded the institutionalization of a
national park system modelled after that of the
United States. Moreover, its goals included the protection of the German homeland in its natural and
historical environment, the preservation of flora
and fauna, as well as local architecture. However,
Heimatschutz activists hoped that the polluting and
exploitative system could be overcome simply
by “good intentions.” Despite their outreach,
which led to international conferences in Paris
(1909) and Stuttgart (1912) in which almost all
European countries and Japan participated, their
fight remained ineffective.
The examination of ecological concepts during the era of European fascism, and especially
National Socialism in Germany, is somewhat
problematic. While coalitions of fascist parties
with bourgeois governments were the rule in
almost all European countries in the 1920s and
1930s, it was only the Nazis who seem to have
expressed certain environmental concerns. Indeed,
the Nazis adopted some ideas of the petty bourgeois Heimatschutz movement, the life reform
movements from around 1900, and the settlers
movement from the 1920s, all of which they
regarded as precursors to volkish Ideology. The
leading theoretician was Richard Walter Darré,
who became Minister for Agriculture in 1933.
His goal was to develop Germany into a healthy
peasant state, built on a biologically dynamic

213
(1970) drew more and more attention to the pollution of soil, water, and air, population growth,
and the merciless eradication of wild animals
and plants. The slogan “biology or death” reached
widespread popularity when the mass media
repeatedly reported on chemical warfare in
Vietnam and publicized environmental catastrophes such as the oil spills caused by the tanker
Torrey Canyon off the British coast in 1967 and
the blowout of the oil platform off the coast of
Santa Barbara, California, in 1969. Among the
first to adopt the term “ecology” were the hippies,
who popularized slogans such as “solar energy,”
“water power,” “turning on to nature,” or “survival with grace” in magazines such as The Mother
Earth News. In referring to “the great refusal,” a
term coined by Herbert Marcuse, the hippies
did not want to participate in the destruction
of nature and instead embraced the idea of the
simple life.
All these publications and protests contributed
to the environmental campaign which Gaylord
Nelson from Wisconsin started in the US Senate,
leading to the establishing of the semi-official
“Earth Day” in 1970 and the founding of the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). More
than 500,000 people participated in the first
“Earth Day” activities, building either on the
EPA’s “ecotactics” or on recycling, a more sparing use of resources as well as the activities of the
individual. It was hoped that these measures
would soon allow a return to normalcy.
But the doomsday shock was further reinforced
by a study conducted by European industrialists
and scientists, developed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Boston, fostered by
the “Club of Rome,” and published in 1971
under the title The Limits to Growth. The goal
of this analysis was to determine the timeframe
for the collapse of the economic system due to
the oppositional state of diminishing natural
resources and the growth of the world population.
Among the recommendations were a drastic
limitation on population growth, a sparing use of
resources, and a radical reduction in consumerism. Since the book was translated immediately
into almost all languages, it can be seen as
the beginning of an unprecedented, worldwide,
environmental awareness, as well as the onset of
the theoretical Discourse on ecology. Moreover,
the study indirectly reinforced the understanding

ecology

agriculture. Supporters of such ideas believed
they had a strong ally in Adolf Hitler, who was
well known for his love of animals, his vegetarianism, and his rejection of vivisection. Such
inclinations, however, soon turned out to be
false, since Hitler’s true goals were the creation
of jobs and the development of a strong military
industry. The results were renewed industrialization, massive migrations from the land to the cities,
and thus large-scale environmental degradation.
Even several laws which were passed between
1934 and 1936 to protect German “art, culture,
and nature” were purely of a propagandistic
character. More and more, National Socialism
revealed itself as an ideologically incoherent
system ruled by the dictatorship of the gaining
and maintaining of power. Such power struggles,
along with the politics of military armament and
economic autarky, were diametrically opposed
to any ecological concepts. None the less, the display of hypocritical laws and their vegetarianism
based on Buddhist occultism severely corrupted
all sincere concepts of ecology and vegetarianism
in Germany.
After 1945 the United States emerged as the
leading economic and political power of the
West. Thus it is no surprise that the interest in
ecological concepts after the end of the 1939–45
war emerged first in that country. The analyses
were based mostly on different experiences,
namely the dust storms of the 1930s resulting from
soil erosion, clearcutting and overgrazing, as well
as the development of biological, chemical, and
atomic weapons during the war. Scientists such
as Fairfield Osborn (Our Plundered Planet, 1948)
and Aldo Leopold (Sand County Almanack,
1949) were among the first to warn of diminishing natural resources and the growing world
population and to outline ecological alternatives.
The first book to become a bestseller was Rachel
Carson’s Silent Spring (1962), listed in the New
York Times for 31 weeks. Carson outlined the
negative effects of the use of pesticides, which
contaminated the earth’s surface and would
soon endanger all forms of life on the planet.
In addition, books such as Barry Commoner’s
Science and Survival (1963), Gary Snyder’s Earth
Household (1963), Paul Ehrlich’s The Population
Bomb (1968), Theodore Roszak’s The Making of a
Counter Culture (1968), and Barry Commoner’s
The Closing Circle: Nature, Man, and Technology

that, in terms of pollution and exploitation of natural resources, there was little difference between
a privately organized economy and an economy
run by the state.
The large number of publications concerning
“environmental protection” caused a number
of developments, starting in the 1970s. Among
the first was the founding of international
organizations such as Greenpeace in 1971, which
protested against atomic testing, air and water
pollution, as well as the killing of animals. Owing
to intense media coverage, this protest reached an
increasingly concerned public around the globe.
In order to resist the process of constant industrialization, ecologists such as E.F. Schumacher and
Murray Bookchin prescribed the concept “small
is beautiful,” which aimed at a comprehensible
world view within a locally defined economy,
thus displaying the ecological slogan “Think
globally, act locally.” A typical example for this
concept was Ernest Callenbach’s novel Ecotopia
(1975), a blueprint for a peaceful and ecological
society that has abandoned the devastation and
exploitation of nature. In his novel, Ecotopia
Emerging (1981), Callenbach even described how
a growing ecological consciousness led to concrete
politics that resulted in the separation of the
states of Oregon, Washington, and Northern
California from the rest of the United States.
Such books reflected realistically events in North
America and Europe during the 1970s, namely the
formation of “green” movements.
Moreover, the oil crisis which marked the
beginning of the 1970s also led to a search for different energy sources. Consequently, atomic power
was hailed as a savior from all energy problems.
Protests against the construction of atomic
power stations were waged across Western
Europe throughout the 1970s, leading to a wellorganized peace movement by 1980. In the United
States the No-Nukes movement expressed similar goals and received widespread support, particularly after the “accident” at the Pennsylvania
atomic power plant on Three Mile Island in
March 1978 became public knowledge.
The first “green” party to gain worldwide
attention was the West German Greens (Die
Grünen), which was founded in 1980 and at that
time consisted of a variety of protest groups,
including leftists, feminists, anarchists, pacifists,
and conservative farmers. Prominent members of

this anti-party party, as they called themselves, were
the feminist Petra K. Kelly (Fighting for Hope,
1983) and the Marxist Rudolf Bahro. Similarly,
East German Marxists such as Wolfgang Harich
(Kommunismus ohne Wachstum?/Communism
without Growth? 1975) and Robert Havemann
(Morgen. Die Industriegesellschaft am Scheideweg/
Tomorrow. Industrial Society at the Crossroads,
1980) critiqued the report by the “Club of Rome,”
offering ecosocialism as a possible solution.
Such ecological and political alternatives were
indirectly supported by the study Global 2000
(1980), initiated by US President Jimmy Carter.
This analysis predicted a world population of 6.3
billion by the year 2000, growing desertification,
rapid diminishing of natural resources, increase
in the devastation of ecosystems, etc. However,
the growing number of right-wing governments
in the early 1980s in the “First World” and their
promises for more economic “progress” quickly
dismissed such warnings as apocalyptic and
unfounded.
The promises for “growth” were partly related
to the decision of NATO in 1979 to station more
strategic weapons in Western Europe. Despite
massive protests by the peace movement supported by the Greens, especially in Germany, the
deployment of Cruise missiles and Pershings was
begun in 1982. This resulted in widespread anger
and fear, and found its artistic expression in
literature and films thematizing “the death of
nature” as well as scenarios of an impending
atomic apocalypse. Moreover, theories defining the
present time in terms of “postmodernity” and
posthistoire were popularized in the United States
and Europe, thereby adding to a growing fragmentation of environmental politics. Nevertheless,
such developments did not stop ecological parties and movements worldwide from becoming the
most popular political force in the 1980s. Their
peaceful and ecological politics were reinforced by
disasters such as Chernobyl (1986) and Bhopal
(1989), the long-term ecological consequences
of which will remain unknown for many years.
The 1971 report The Limits to Growth had
also made obvious that the wealth of the “First
World” was entirely dependent on the exploitation of the “Third World.” Political activism
of the 1960s against the war in Vietnam and
for the liberation of the peoples in the “Third
World” increasingly grew into protests against the

215
(for example, the periodical Capitalism, Nature,
Socialism) to scientific treatises such as Donella
and Dennis Meadows’s and Jørgen Randers’s
Beyond the Limits: Confronting Global Collapse,
Envisioning a Sustainable Future (1992) and the
“World scientists’ warning to humanity” (1992),
signed by 1,575 scientists from 69 countries, as
well as liberalist politicians examining the future
of the planet in their books, is proof that the debate
about the survival of humankind has entered a
crucial stage. However, such liberalists tend to
fail in their analysis of the relation between the
exploitation of natural resources, consumer ideology, and population growth. Such an analysis
is vital, considering the projected population
growth and the impending “irreversibility” in
the devastation of nature before the middle of the
twenty-first century. Obviously, radical changes
of this course, which has been described aptly as
suicidal, are necessary. Political and economic
programs based on ecological insights such as
solidarity, brother- and sisterhood, and guided by
the concept “fewer people, less consumption”
are needed in order to avoid a relapse into the
Stone Age. Similarly, a new Ethics in respect
of nature, culture, material needs, and life in
general, along with an educational system built on
respect, tolerance, and peacefulness, is essential.
The decentralization of political and economic
power is a first step in order to return responsibilities to regions and local businesses, producing
high-quality and long-lasting goods made by
individuals who can be proud of their achievements. Similarly, alternative energy sources need
to be developed, mass tourism has to be reduced
drastically, and rare resources must be recycled.
Overall, the industrialized countries have to
move away from a society run by high-tech
computers and instead have to find programs for
the integration of nature and technology on a local
level. Of course, such activities require much
planning as well as a challenge to the right to the
unlimited exploitation of nature.

devastation of the “Third World” during the 1970s
and 1980s. Protests raged against the clearcutting
of the rain-forest, the plundering of resources in
Antarctica, the killing of whales for “scientific
research,” the overfishing of the world’s oceans,
the dumping of atomic and chemical waste into
the oceans, etc. These activities were often led by
international organizations such as Greenpeace
and supported by local ecological organizations
and parties.
The period of unleashed economic “growth” in
the industrialized counties which lasted throughout most of the 1980s added to the feeling of
powerlessness, hopelessness, and apathy among
many people, leading to a withdrawal from
political action. Such individuals and groups
generally welcomed the arrival of New Age
philosophy of which the physicist Fritjof Capra
(The Turning Point, 1982) was probably the most
prominent figure. Not unlike the followers of
“deep ecology,” their dream was to regain the unity
of humankind and nature, based on the ideas
of anthropocentric spirituality and biocentric
equality. Moreover, such individualistic prophecies were mostly guided by the understanding that
the coming of the “new age” cannot be stopped,
despite the ongoing devastation and exploitation
of nature. This fragmentation enabled heavy
attacks worldwide on organizations such as Greenpeace by the industry and mass media. According
to such accusations the only difference between
Greenpeace and multinational corporations was
that their “profits” were based on “selling” an
ecological ideology which was untimely, unnecessary, and just as exploitative. Thus the “Earth
Summit,” orchestrated by the industrialized
nations in Rio de Janeiro in the summer of 1992,
did not lead to any results, since the criticism of
world trade and its devastating impact on the
world’s ecosystem was systematically excluded
from the discussion.
There can be no doubt that the concepts of
ecological movements and individuals so far
have failed to gain influence on the ideology of
“growth” and “development.” In the wake of the
political changes in the Eastern bloc countries,
“free market economy” again has become the
dominating principle by which the exploitation
of natural resources and the “Third World” is
legitimized. On the other hand, the large number

`education 
The issues of cultural representation, selection, and production in education
are exemplified at their sharpest by the debates
on the school curriculum. Three approaches to
discussions of Culture and school curricula can
be characterized: (i) the derivation of curricula
from analyses of culture (the cultural representation model); (ii) the critique of cultural
reproduction through school curricula (the
Ideology–critical model); (iii) the generation of
curricula to further social justice (the cultural
production and empowerment model). These
approaches reinterpret a Weberian analysis of
the links between culture, social status, the economic order, and the distribution of power in
society (see Weber’s analysis of society in terms
of Class, status, and power (1922)).
During this century several attempts have
been made to derive curricula from an analysis
of culture. Some of these reveal the intertwining
of culture and social Class. T.S. Eliot’s Notes
Towards the Definition of Culture (1948) argues for
the preservation of a “High culture” classical
and academic curriculum (for example, the arts,
philosophy, manners, the accumulated wisdom
of the past) which is taught to a social elite and
which helps to preserve an elitist society. Culture, in this definition, is a social accomplishment, a locater of class. In the United Kingdom

this was echoed in Bantock’s Towards a Theory
of Popular Education (1975) in which a “high
culture” curriculum was to be the preserve of a
social elite while a “folk curriculum,” rather than
an academically “watered down” curriculum, was
to be made available to the working classes, comprising recreations and pastimes, dance, media
studies, family life, affective/artistic/physical
(as opposed to cognitive/intellectual) curricula,
design, and craftwork. The social divisiveness
of such curriculum proposals was parallelled by
Mid-winter’s (1972) work in which workingclass children were to study curricula which
deemphasized literacy and numeracy and which
placed great store on the study of the immediate
physical environment, “warts and all,” and community education. Differential access to differential
curricula was seen to reproduce the societal
status quo.
Attempts to break the nexus of social class and
school curricula have been made through moves
to ensure equality of access to a common culture
curriculum. Such moves adopt an anthropological rather than elitist interpretation of culture,
defining it as everything that is created by
humans and which is shared and transmitted
by members of social groups. Cultural analysis
here adopts a more neutral, descriptive approach
than those designed to perpetuate class divisions.
The Core Curriculum for Australian Schools (Curriculum Development Centre, 1980) comprised
elements of a common multiculture – seeking a
form of cultural integration which emphasized
interaction between diverse groups – and an
identification of core learning processes, learning experiences, and knowledge, an entitlement
to which was the right of all children.
In the United Kingdom Lawton’s Education,
Culture and the National Curriculum (1989)
provides a fuller example of a curriculum which
addresses specific features of a culture. He identifies “cultural invariants” (for example, the economic system, sociopolitical system, technology
system) and characterizes these in the context
of contemporary England (for example, dense
population, urbanized, industrialized, multicultural, secular), moving to a series of prescriptions
for curricula which represent key elements of
English culture (for example, studying urbanization, economic systems, multicultural education,
political education, tolerance). Lawton’s work

curriculum, for they can engage with it easily
and comfortably; for those students with limited
cultural capital or different habitus the school
curriculum represents an alien culture such that
their uptake of it is correspondingly limited. The
same curriculum, offered equally to all, produces
differential outcomes which, in turn, perpetuate the societal status quo. The curriculum,
therefore, performs an ideological function in
reproducing cultural and social inequality under
the guise of equality of opportunity, suggesting
that it is natural ability rather than structural
inequality which causes differential outcomes,
focusing attention away from the socially reproductive effects of academic curricula.
Bourdieu’s analysis resonates with Althusser’s
(1972) structuralist account of education as an
Ideological state apparatus which functions
to prepare students in terms of ideology and
knowledge to fulfill differing economic demands
of capitalism. This theme is extended in Bowles’s
and Gintis’s (1976) account of the operation of
the “hidden curriculum” of developing personality traits which prepare future factory workers
in America (1976), in a study of differential
teacher expectations and interactions by social
class in New Jersey schools by Anyon (1980),
and in Delpit’s (1988) analysis of how “cultures
of power” are reproduced in classrooms. In
all of these accounts there is little opportunity
for teachers and students to escape from the
mechanism.
In contrast to these watertight and deterministic systems, Giroux (1983) argues that
schools are “relatively autonomous” institutions,
that teachers are not “cultural dopes” or puppets
of the state. Teachers and students can exert
their agency. Recognizing this, however, renders
the problems of cultural imperialism in curricula
no less soluble. Cultural analysis has to engage
issues of power and legitimacy in curricula and
their relationship to the wider society; it requires
a political analysis of the school curriculum.
Giroux argues that cultural domination is as
pervasive as it is insidious, and therefore teachers
and students will need to seize any opportunity
for resistance; they will need to look for “chinks
in the armour.” This enterprise will entail a critical interrogation of curricula to question whose
cultures are “named” (confirmed) and whose are
“silenced” (disconfirmed) in them (Fine, 1987),

education

on cultural analysis over two decades, however, has been criticized for being superficial,
neglectful of critique, silent on issues of power
and conflict, value-laden, under-researched,
consensus-seeking, and selective (Whitty, 1985).
Nevertheless Lawton, in stating that the curriculum is necessarily a selection from culture,
sets the ground for a fuller analysis of the problems that this selection brings. These include the
problem of cultural inclusion and exclusion, the
legitimacy of decision makers, and the interests
which are served by such inclusion and exclusion,
in short a sociology and ideology critique of
school knowledge.
An ideology critique of school knowledge questions the functions of school knowledge in its
relationship to the wider society. Young (1971)
argued that school curricula celebrated an academic culture, focusing on mental rather than
manual aspects of education, being literary, individualized, abstract, and unrelated to everyday
life. In the same volume Bernstein linked this
to forms of social control, arguing that according
high status to academic knowledge reproduced
existing class and power differentials in society.
Poulantzas (1975) extended this analysis by arguing that schools reproduce the mental/manual
social divide in the qualifications that they
award, essentially rewarding mental activity and
disqualifying (not certificating) manual labor, a
view that was given empirical support in Willis’s
Learning to Labour (1977). That the school curriculum is tenaciously resistant to the abandonment of an academic tradition and its cultural links
with state-endorsed social reproduction can be seen
in Hargreaves’s references to the “hegemonic
academic curriculum” (1989).
Nor does simply equalizing access to an academic curriculum guarantee that the socially and
culturally reproductive effects of schooling will be
upset easily. Bourdieu’s powerful analysis of the
school as a conservative force (1976) argues that
students’ success at school is a function of their
possession of “cultural capital” and “habitus”
(Bourdieu, 1977) (for example, dispositions,
attitudes, and motivations to learning; parental
support for education; social advantage; ease in
dealing with authority figures; linguistic ability;
high culture). Students with the cultural capital
and habitus that correspond with those in
schools can maximize their uptake of the school

be they in terms of Race, class, gender, or
subcultural membership. This endorses the message of Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1972),
which advocates the empowerment of currently
disempowered social groups by developing literacy programs which are rooted in the concrete
experiences of different cultural groups of
Brazilian society.
Decisions on curriculum content reflect and
reinforce the power structures of society. Anyon’s
(1981) analysis of American social studies textbooks found that they omitted and delegitimized
(i) conflict and alternatives to capitalist economies; (ii) inequalities of power by race, class,
and gender; (iii) inequalities of political and
economic power. In the United Kingdom the
contentious nature of the cultural content of
curricula was evidenced in the debate over proposals for a history curriculum, which was seen
to celebrate white, supremacist, and imperialist
cultures. Apple (1993) argues that the imposition
of a national curriculum in American schools
disregards cultural diversity in favor of a putative, identifiable, mainstream culture. The effects
of this, however, are to reproduce existing power
differentials in society and to serve a wider
conservative political culture of consumerism,
acquisitiveness, competitiveness, and privatization which perpetuates the power of the already
empowered and the disempowering of the already
disempowered. Echoing Giroux, Apple argues
that the proposal for a national curriculum issues
from a dominant and dominating culture and is
ideological in that, under the guise of serving
individual freedoms, the agenda for the curriculum given by the dominant political power is
not called into question. Rather, he argues, it is
the conditions for cultural diversity in the school
curriculum that should be guaranteed in proposals
for a national curriculum.
The ideology critique of Giroux’s works
owes much to the Critical theory of the
Frankfurt school, particularly the work of
Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse. More
recent analyses of the curriculum are informed
by aspects of the work of Jürgen Habermas.
Habermas’s threefold schema of knowledge–
constitutive interests can be used to identify
the interests at work in the curriculum and to
suggest an agenda for cultural empowerment
(for example, Grundy, 1987; Smyth, 1991). A

curriculum which is premised on Habermas’s
technical interest is culturally controlled and
controlling, that is, it is culturally and socially
reproductive. A curriculum which is premissed on
Habermas’s Hermeneutic interest is culturally
reproductive in its effects (rather than necessarily its intentions) in that its concern for
understanding overlooks questions of legitimacy
and ideology critique. Habermas’s emancipatory
interest suggests a curriculum which, through
active and experiential pedagogies, interrogates the
legitimacy of social and cultural determinants
of school knowledge and promotes the collective empowerment of diverse cultures and subcultures in society (Morrison, 1994a). The link
between critique and empowerment recharges
and politically radicalizes Dewey’s progressivism
for the promotion of democracy (Morrison,
1989). In this view the school curriculum becomes
socially transformative rather than reproductive.
It furthers social justice and the realization of
collective existential futures, equalizing and redistributing power in society.
Further, Habermas’s appeal to Communicative action (1984, 1987) can be seen as a means
of breaking the “suppression of generalizable
interests” of scientific rationality. Communicative
rationality, in which interests, powers, and cultural empowerment are rendered transparent
and judged by their capacity to realize the “ideal
speech situation” and constraint-free communication, celebrates the cultural specificity of school
curricula. In Habermasian terms, the lifeworlds
of teachers and students can be “recoupled” to
structural elements of society through curricula
which work on and with the cultural fabric
of specific societies and groups. This argues for
a cultural problematization of school curricula
(both formal and hidden) and the espousal of
pedagogies which derive from the “ideal speech
situation,” for example: cooperative and collaborative work; discussion-based teaching; activities
which critically interrogate curriculum content;
autonomous and experiential learning; negotiated
learning; community-related activities; problemsolving activities (Morrison, 1994b).
Arguing for culturally diverse curricula suggests
that power to take decisions on curriculum content is diffuse and decentered. While this accords
with Foucauldian notions of multiple sites and
channels of power (Foucault, 1980), while it

`eighteenth-century studies 
There is more
than one eighteenth century, just as there is
more than one form of Critical and Cultural
theory. The English literature, history, and
culture of the period 1660–1798, variously
known as “Augustan,” “neoclassical,” “Enlightenment,” and simply “eighteenth-century” – a
period consciously and consistently interested in
its relations with the Greek and Roman classical
past as well as with its own recent civil and
political history – has not received the kind of striking and transforming attention from contemporary theoretical readings as have Renaissance,
Romantic, and modern literature. One reason
for this relative lack of interest in eighteenthcentury literature by critical theorists lies in what
is taken to be the recalcitrance of the material itself.
Eighteenth-century thought has commonly been
perceived as absolutist, positivist, rational, and
logocentric – philosophical and literary properties that Deconstruction, Discourse theory,
Lacanianism, feminism, New Historicism, and
other forms of cultural theory have sought to
challenge since the 1960s. John Bender (1992),
for example, sees the conservative nature and the
linguistic and political unawareness of traditional
eighteenth-century studies as rooted in its similarities to the postulates of eighteenth-century
thought itself, a historical and epistemological
situation that has enforced the confidence and
unreflexiveness of that traditional scholarship,
but which has also obviated the possibility of real
critical knowledge that only comes, according to

eighteenth-century studies

breaks with Marxist conceptions of the limited
locus of power (see Marxism), and while it recognizes that education is an “essentially contested”
concept, this view sits uncomfortably with the
experience of many nations across the world
where decisions on curriculum content are taken
by increasingly interventionist and dirigiste governments. However, the cultural problematics of
school curricula will not go away; struggles over
cultural representation, cultural diversity, and
the empowerment of cultural groups in curricula
continue to reflect the coupling of power and ideology in society and continue to treat the school
curriculum as a “contested terrain” (Giroux,
1983). The case against cultural diversity in the
curriculum argues for a central cultural spine
in society to counter the perceived threats to the
existing social and moral order which are posed
when diversity slips into relativism; the case for
diversity argues that anything else is either ideological or socially reproductive.

eighteenth-century studies

220
Bender who cites Anthony Giddens (1990), when
the inquirer stands outside the framework of reference occupied by the object of study. This not
only challenges traditional positivist historical
scholarship, which has assumed that critical truth
depended on seeing the past in its own terms, but
it also implies that the recent advent of Critical
theory in eighteenth-century studies challenges
the ideals and frame of reference of the eighteenth
century itself.
It is precisely this apparent subversiveness
of critical theory with regard to meaning, truth,
and historical continuity – values that have been
central to the ideological study of the period – that
eighteenth-century scholars have deplored. An
implicit debate has continued between those who
see historical understanding as reading works of
the century “on and within their own terms,” and
those who see it as necessarily entailing a reading from the perspective of later developments.
The best recent critical work, including some
of the books in the reading list below, is able to
incorporate both perspectives, while the least
stimulating believes in the self-sufficiency of one
or the other perspective.
However, the act of distinguishing between
what is “of the past” and what is “of the present”
is problematic, because, as Hayden White,
Stephen Greenblatt, Michel Foucault, and other
cultural historiographers (not to mention postcolonial critics) have argued, historical understanding and the language in which it is encoded
are influenced by the Ideology of our present
position. This situation cuts both ways, delimiting
the parameters of both traditional and theoretical approaches to the eighteenth century. On
the one hand, the eighteenth century is understood
as deeply empirical, referential, and ordered,
and therefore the ahistoricity and skepticism of
Derridean and De Manian deconstruction suggest values and procedures hostile to the notions
of evidence, history, and truth that have underpinned eighteenth-century scholarship. On the
other hand, the assumption that critical and
cultural theory has developed textual and philosophical apparatuses that exceed the techniques
and capacities of Dryden, Rochester, Pope,
Swift, Fielding, Richardson, Johnson, Boswell,
Gibbon, and Burke – to mention only a few
canonical male writers of the period – effectively
not only keeps the eighteenth century fixed in a

hegemonic mode in our minds, but also reveals
the historical and critical naivety of contemporary
theory.
This situation raises an acutely important
point about the nature of historical knowledge and
the grounds of evidence for historical understanding that pertains to contemporary literary
studies in general. The question of whether
“history” is real or textual has haunted every
debate about the value of critical theory. Indeed,
one might argue that the importance of the
question of historical consciousness and historical knowledge in eighteenth-century literature
and eighteenth-century studies is an indication
of the centrality of the eighteenth century in
literary history rather than its marginality. But
the exemplariness of eighteenth-century thought
in this respect is exactly the opposite of what
Bender takes it to be in the article cited above.
For the resistance that canonical eighteenthcentury literature has shown to critical theory is
highly revealing of two factors that are seldom if
ever taken into consideration by “specialists.” It
tells us as much about the point of view from
which eighteenth-century works are read as it
does about the works themselves; and it exemplifies
a mode of historical consciousness and historical
production that Postmodernism has only recently
discovered and articulated in its reading of
Nietzsche, Foucault, and Bakhtin. It is precisely the understanding of the self-consuming
artifacts of the human mind and the relativity
of language that make a writer like Johnson
develop a skeptical prose in his essays that constantly questions and undercuts its own most
serious statements, and builds into itself a resistance to sameness and homogeneity. Like de
Man, Derrida, and Lacan, Johnson’s sensitivity
to the Aporia of language, to the darkness of
the human heart underlying the bright civility
of civilized linguistic constructions, postulates
and embodies the irreducible importance of the
human nature whose site witnesses these enactments. Here is the recognition that knowledge,
history, and meaning exist not in the realm of the
divinely guaranteed, but in the material relationships between people, between mind and world,
between signifier and signified – and between
the human being and God.
While Johnson’s Dictionary is still taken
as the embodiment of conservative, linguistic

221
The period’s particular political awareness may
well be seen in the sociological and anthropological
elements in eighteenth-century historiography
rather than in the political and constitutional
history that has until recently been the focus of
political readings of the period (see, for example,
J.C.D. Clark, Howard Erskine-Hill, and Howard
D. Weinbrot). While eighteenth-century scholarship has as yet resisted the appropriation of fully
developed semiotic, linguistic, and deconstructive
methods – such as we find, for example, in de
Man on Shelley, Hartman on Wordsworth, and
Derrida on Mallarmé, Joyce, and Rousseau –
it has effectively assimilated a variety of cultural
and new historical methodologies that subtend
political discursiveness. In fact, the work of
Foucault, Bakhtin, Blanchot, and other theorists
has facilitated an expansion of the eighteenthcentury Canon to an extent unmatched in other
literary “periods,” as may be seen in the works
by Bender, Landry, Castle, De Bolla, Eagleton,
McKeon, and Nussbaum listed below.
Scholarly works on eighteenth-century topics
now, as a matter of course, discuss the various
subjective and artistic experiences of women, the
sick and insane, and various forms of social,
political, legal, and sexual marginality. The curricular and critical success of Roger Lonsdale’s
Eighteenth-Century Women Poets: An Oxford
Anthology (1989) is one indication of the extent
to which women’s work has become part of the
central stream of eighteenth-century culture.
Recent work in the field has become increasingly
interdisciplinary. In the United States this
movement has been supported by the American
Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies (ASECS),
its annual conference, its journal, EighteenthCentury Studies, and other importantjournals in
the field, such as The Eighteenth Century: Theory
and Interpretation. The movement toward interdisciplinarity and pluralism – for all of its
methodological problems (see Fish, 1989b) – has
had a democratizing effect on eighteenth-century
studies in the Unites States. In the United
Kingdom the politics of European union, and
the traditional insularity and Empiricism of the
English, have complicated the process of internationalization in this field, although not in
other areas (such as Cultural studies per se),
but it must be noted that the British Journal for
Eighteenth-Century Studies has published work

eighteenth-century studies

logocentrism, a careful reading of the “Preface”
to that work reveals the extraordinary degree to
which Johnson yields to the historicity of language, and to his extensive understanding of the
Semiotic nature of language. Likewise, Johnson’s
Lives of the Poets, testifies to an awareness of the
textuality of civilized structures, memory, and
personal and poetic identity, even while the work
enacts a linguistic activity that gives the reader
access to general human experience for which the
word “truth” is not an inappropriate designation.
However, while the paradoxical textuality of
“truth” is unproblematic for Johnson, traditional
eighteenth-century scholars operate as if it is
pretextual and absolute, and critical theorists
devote their energies to eliminating it altogether
as a meaningful concept and experience.
These Johnsonian phenomena, shared to a
lesser extent by other eighteenth-century writers
(for example, Dryden, Swift, Hume, Gibbon) are
unusual in their capacity to hold together creatively experiences of change and permanence.
The resistance generated between them is integral
to the historical knowledge of Johnson’s texts.
This historical knowledge – akin to Foucault’s
“genealogy” (1984c) and different in kind from
the positivism which equates history with the
referential depiction of a priori “fact” – is at the
center of postmodern debates about history,
authority, textuality, self, and the concept of the
author. Certain works of metafiction by Peter
Ackroyd, Jeanette Winterson, Graham Swift, J.M.
Coetzee, and Italo Calvino already exemplify
various ways in which postmodern culture is continuous with, though different from, eighteenthcentury culture. The translational relationship
between these and other postmodern novelists and
the eighteenth centuries that they ventriloquize will
become increasingly important and influential
in the general rethinking of the continuities
and discontinuities between the present and the
past of which critical and cultural theory are
part. This is also the perspective from which history is recognized as the product of the present
moment’s continuing negotiation with and invention of the past, and that power and authority (as
Bender notes) become political realities shaped
by historical discourse of one kind or another.
My sense, however, is that the eighteenth century
is more self-reflexive than Bender suggests about
discursive power and contingencies.

on British, American, and European cultural
history since its inception in 1971, though with
a lower theoretical profile. Most notable is the
advent of new professional societies for the study
of the eighteenth century, such as the South
African Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.
Its first conference and conference proceedings (see
Leighton, 1992) were organized around the theme
of the rights of humankind, and revealed the
critical and philosophical application of Enlightenment concepts to the contemporary political
and cultural situation in South Africa in a very
eighteenth-century spirit.
Both the United Kingdom and the United
States have witnessed to some extent the breaking down of the barriers between the traditional
Genres, such as the epic, formal verse satire, and
the lyric, and have seen a cross-fertilization with
formerly “minor” genres such as diaries, letters,
journalism, travelogues, and legal and historical
texts of different kinds. In fact, the notions
of “literature” and “English” have come under
scrutiny in eighteenth-century studies over the last
ten years with a deliberateness that belies the
still popular notion of the eighteenth century as
a conservative period. The greatest beneficiary
of this shake-up has been the novel, now the
subject of major American critical studies that
have effectively established it as having the kind
of centrality to eighteenth-century culture as the
epic and verse satire had 20 years ago.
In conclusion, eighteenth-century studies is a
rich, many-sided, paradoxical field of investigation which turns out to be most open to theoretical inquiry even at the moment that it appears to
be most closed. It is striking that Derrida, Deleuze,
Foucault, Barthes, Bachelard, Lévi-strauss,
Lacan, and Lyotard have all found eighteenthcentury texts central to their work in theory.

`Eisenstein, Sergei (1898–1948) 
One of the
greatest film directors of all times, a pioneer of
the Russian revolutionary cinema, whose film
Battleship Potemkin has been honored as the
greatest film ever made. However, almost from the
very beginning of his career, Eisenstein was criticized by official Soviet critics for the excessive
intellectualism of his films, especially The Ten Days
That Shook the World (1928) and The Old and the
New (1929). In the early 1930s Eisenstein took
an extensive trip to Europe and America, entertaining a thought of staying in the West. After an
unsuccessful attempt at making the movie Que
Viva Mexico and problems with Hollywood producers, Eisenstein was forced to return to the Soviet
Union, where he experienced several disciplinary setbacks, the most publicized of which was
the shelving of his film Bezhin Meadow (1935)
because of its pronounced religious symbolism.
During the prewar years and the entire 1939–45
war, Eisenstein finally achieved official recognition
and silenced his critics. He produced a patriotic
film Alexander Nevsky (1938) as a warning to Nazi
Germany, and the first part of the unfinished
trilogy Ivan the Terrible (1945). Alexander Nevsky

spectator those senses or that psychology which
influences his experience – every element that can
be verified and mathematically calculated to
produce certain emotional shocks in a proper
order within the totality,” as a semantic sign in
the general system of the analyzed production:
“I establish attraction as normally being an
independent and primary element in the construction of a theatrical production – a molecular (i.e.,
compound) unity of the efficiency of the theater
and of theater in general.” His concept of a shot
as a cell of montage is connected with a more
general idea of reflection of the macrostructure
of an art work, derived from the work’s theme,
in every detail and the entire structure of that
art work. Montage becomes the mechanism for
the activation of signs and thus generates the
meaning of the second order. “Representation
A and representation B must be so selected from
all the possible features within the theme that is
being developed, must be so sought for, that their
juxta-position . . . shall evoke in the perception
and feelings of the spectator the most complete
image of the theme itself ” (p. 69). By breaking
down the static progression of logical action,
montage of arbitrary selection and independent
actions advances the representation to a new
semantic plane.
Eisenstein pays special attention to the notion
of structure, which he treats as an interconnection of elements which allows for the creation of
complex, semantically charged, spatial oppositions.
Thus developing visual semantics in Battleship
Potemkin, Eisenstein proceeds from the eastern
Yang–Yin symbol of the two counterbalancing
tendencies of evolution and involution and the
dynamic dual distribution of forces, comprising
the active or masculine principle (Yang) and the
passive or feminine principle (Yin). He adds to
the Yang–Yin opposition the traditional Slavic
odd and even count and gives it a visual representation, for example, in the scene where boats,
the sails of which resemble both birds’ wings and
the helicoidal symbol of Yang–Yin, bring food
(and therefore life) to the sailors of Potemkin.
He develops this notion further in his articles,
essays, and lectures of the 1930s and establishes in
them the principles of development of a theme
in the entire structure of an art work. From the
1930s Eisenstein attempts a scientific description
and conscientious assimilation of “emotional

Eisenstein, Sergei

was Eisenstein’s first sound film. In it he experimented with the principles of “vertical montage,”
which meant the correlation between visual
imagery and sound (the score for the film was
written by A. Prokofiev). Stalin personally liked
the lavishly produced Part I of Ivan the Terrible,
which depicted Ivan as a strong ruler fighting government corruption and intrigue, and Eisenstein
was awarded a Stalin Prize for his film. However,
Part II, which was completed in 1946 and showed
the Tsar as a paranoiac despot surrounded by
ruthless henchmen bearing an unmistakable
resemblance to Stalin’s secret police, was condemned and shown only in 1958, five years after
Stalin’s death. The director died in 1948 before
he had time to complete his trilogy.
In their praise for Eisenstein’s cinematic
achievements, critics often overlook his contribution to the development of the poetics of
cinema and the general theory of Semiotics.
Eisenstein’s theoretical works are inextricably
connected with his practice, and his arguments
grow directly out of the analysis of his cinematic
experiments, like the films Strike (1925) and
Battleship Potemkin (1926) which were based on
the main discovery of Eisenstein, the principles
of montage. In his essay, “Synchronization of
Senses,” Eisenstein defines montage as the following: “Piece A, derived from the elements of the
theme being developed, and piece B, derived
from the same source, in juxtaposition give birth
to the image in which the thematic matter is
most clearly embodied.” In other words, montage
appears as a connection in a sintagmatic sequence of two pictorial signs, each of which can
correspond to a concrete object (the denotation
of this Sign). These two signs in the combination
with one another become a complex, abstract
Symbol which correlates to a new concept and
not to those denotations.
Eisenstein turns the syntax of a work of art
into a means for the studies of semantics. From
the very beginning of his career Eisenstein treats
cinematic works in semiotic terms. In his first
published theoretic work Montage of Attractions
(LEF in 1923), based on the analysis of his own
constructivist production of A. Ostrovsky’s play
Enough Simplicity in Every Wise Man, Eisenstein
considers the Attraction, by which he means
“every aggressive moment in [an art work],
i.e., every element of it that brings to light in the

Eliot, Thomas Steams

224
thinking,” the process which was very close to the
findings of the Russian psychologist L. Vygotsky
in the area of prelogical thinking and its reflection in contemporary Art. The originality of
Eisenstein’s approach consists of the fact that his
studies of the syntax of situations in cinema
produce not simply an analysis of fixed symbols
but an active structure of basic situations which
reveals certain primary archaic significance of
these situations.
Eisenstein’s ethnological and semiotic sketches
still remain unpublished, but, according to V.
Ivanov’s statement in his book Sketches on the History of Semiotics in the USSR, they are extremely
interesting, not only because they anticipate the
later semiotic theories, but also because they reveal
a new, unexplored layer of Eisenstein’s artistic
experiments.

`Eliot, Thomas Steams (1888–1965)
American (later British) critic. By far the most
influential critic writing in English in the twentieth century, Eliot in effect set the terms and
created the Canon for criticism for 50 years,
from the end of the 1914–18 war until the “turn
to theory” in the early 1970s. The dominant critical positions – Leavisism in England and New
Criticism in the United States – were essentially
elaborations of the key pages of his earlier essays,
collected together in The Sacred Wood (1920).
Eliot never wrote a full-length critical work,
saying that he had “no general theory,” and

claimed to be surprised at how influential his
occasional essays had become, describing them
as merely “a by-product of my private poetry
workshop.” However, taken together they in fact
constitute a comprehensive literary theory, a
new map of English literature, and, underpinning
both, a potent and idiosyncratic philosophy of
history. All three reflect a single vision, a vision
of order and disorder: the disorder of the modern mind and modern history (“the immense
panorama of futility and anarchy” as Eliot called
it), and the longing for a world of imaginary
order we have lost. The pivot of the whole enterprise was his enormously influential notion of
the Dissociation of sensibility, the fatal split
between thought and feeling supposed to have
occurred in the early seventeenth century with the
growth of science and skepticism, which resulted
in later poets (and, by implication, Culture as
a whole) being one-sided, either overintellectual
(the eighteenth century) or overemotional (the
Romantics and Victorians). This picture, filled
out in Eliot’s many essays on individual writers,
changed the taste of his time and, worked out more
comprehensively by admirers such as Leavis
and Empson in England and the New Critics
in America, created an entirely new canon.
The great English writers were now seen as the
“school of Donne,” while Milton, the eighteenth
century, and Romantic and Victorian poetry
were downgraded.
Eliot’s governing ideal of the “unified sensibility,” the middle way between the excesses of
rationalism and the excesses of emotionalism,
clearly had deep roots in his own psyche as
well as in his early work as a philosopher, and
it generated all his other key concepts. He urged
a return to what he called “classicism” – selfdiscipline by submission to external authority
(initially a humanist authority but later identified
with religious orthodoxy) as opposed to the
emotional egotism of Romanticism and Liberalism, the followers of the “inner voice.” True
poetic originality was to be gained by submission
to “tradition” (increasingly, “the tradition”), by
impersonality (“Poetry is not a turning loose of
emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not
the expression of personality, but an escape from
personality”), and by the creation of an objective
correlative, an adequate externalization of the
author’s private feelings.

`Ellmann, Mary (1921–89) 
US feminist literary critic. Ellmann’s Thinking About Women
(1968) is a classic feminist Text, reminiscent of
Woolf ’s A Room of One’s Own (1928), with which
it shares both thematic concerns and narrative and
rhetorical strategies. Ellmann’s major thesis is that
while “sexual exigency” – the perceived need
for men to be physically “strong” and women to
be nurturing mothers – has become redundant
and obsolete in the twentieth century, Western
thought still proceeds mainly by “sexual analogy”:
that is, our language for expressing thought
classifies nearly all experience and phenomena
in terms of sexual difference. Through the mid1980s, before the synthesis of American and

French feminist approaches, Thinking About
Women was widely read by both camps. Ellmann’s
chapters on “Feminine stereotypes” and women
writers’ “Responses” inaugurated the feminist
analysis of “images of women” and inspired
Gynocritics, while French feminists praised
Ellmann’s verbal playfulness, use of irony, and
attention to contradictions in sexual discourse
(“I am most interested in women as words – as
the words they pull out of mouths,” p. xv).

`Emerson and philosophy 
I needed Emerson to be recognized as a philosophical voice
in the early 1970s for various reasons. Because
accepting Emerson as a philosopher is still apt
to seem eccentric, I cast my remarks in the first
person. He did not help me discover philosophy
for myself, but after some two decades in which
I published my first three books, it was Emerson
(with and against Thoreau) who encouraged me
to continue finding its path.
When I began reading philosophy, at UCLA
in 1948, having decided after graduating college
that a life of musical composition and performance
was no longer my intention, analytical philosophy was philosophy’s Avant-garde: the most
active and influential teachers taught it and the
most interesting and productive graduate students believed and contested what those teachers
taught. At that time, this dispensation of philosophy meant primarily Logical positivism,
whose saints were Bertrand Russell and the young
Wittgenstein, along with the refugees Rudolf
Carnap and Hans Reichenbach (the latter the
most prominent figure in the UCLA philosophy
department), whose struggle seemed to be with
the whole history of philosophy, and beyond that
with the whole of human speech, and (because
of Abraham Kaplan’s and Donald Piatt’s presence
as teachers in that department) with pragmatism

Emerson and philosophy

These were powerful critical tools. However,
they were too controversial to remain unchallenged. It became increasingly clear that Eliot’s
picture of literary history was not very historical
and was basically the projection of his own preoccupations, the “by-product” of the imagination
that created The Waste Land. They led to quirky
readings of individual texts (Hamlet was seen
as a failure, Milton’s style a disaster, Donne a
kind of symbolist) and, more generally, to an
oversimplified and monolithic picture of “the
tradition” and to an idealist view of history “a pattern of timeless moments.” This no longer seems
a very useful way of understanding history or a
useful basis for a literary Hermeneutics. While
Eliot’s essays remain striking and stimulating, it
now seems best to read them, not (as his admirers did) as the keystone of a general literary
theory and historiography, but as the “workshop
criticism” of a highly idiosyncratic poet whose deep
fear of the “disorder” of Modernity, science,
liberalism, and Humanism we need not endorse.

Criticism.

Emerson and philosophy

more specifically, especially in moral philosophy
(aesthetics was largely moribund). Now, sixty
years later, the history of philosophy seems to
be thriving as never before in my experience,
but an inherited struggle, or plain split, is now
said to exist between something called analytical
philosophy and something called continental
philosophy. Just as decisively, analytical philosophy is itself deeply divided between something we
might call neo-positivism and Wittgensteinianism,
and the latter is itself further divided between those
who find a break and those who find a continuity between the early and the later Wittgenstein.
Moreover, those who stress the later Wittgenstein,
which is primarily to say Philosophical Investigations, are themselves divided between those who
regard that text as proposing a neo-pragmatist
solution to its perceptions of skeptical possibility
and those who on the contrary find its originality bound up in its refusal of any such solutions.
Two more recent and perhaps more pertinent
developments suggest complications that go
quite beyond any iteration of momentarily neat
divisions of philosophical intention and ambition. One is an increasing sense that Emerson
lies in the background of pragmatism (by way
of Dewey’s admiration for Emerson), itself in
conflict with those who, like myself, are also
impressed with Emerson in the background –
through Nietzsche – of Heidegger. Another
complication is that both in Europe and in the
United States, and beyond, a number of philosophers are increasingly showing dissatisfaction
with the very distinction between analytical and
continental philosophy, and are accordingly
re-asking, perhaps renewing, the question philosophy is permanently fated to re-ask: what is
philosophy?
Continental philosophy essentially did not exist
for me or for my teachers in those first years I have
mentioned, but when in 1951 I transferred from
UCLA to graduate school in the philosophy
department at Harvard, I came to know members
of a small group of graduate students (some
evidently talented and disaffected with philosophy as currently taught in the Anglo-American
dispensation) who were working together on
their own translation of Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit.
Evidently they did not feel intellectually satiated
by the uncooked information that Heidegger
had been attracted to Nazism. In 1962, the

year before I returned from six years of teaching
at Berkeley to take up a permanent position
teaching at Harvard, Being and Time existed in
English. In the middle of my second year back
at Harvard, a number of graduate students in
philosophy there, while not religious about their
interest in Heidegger, nevertheless felt it important for his major work to be taught and studied
in our philosophy department, and it was obvious that it would be me whom they approached
to introduce it. It was a case of the cunning
of history: I wanted to bring Heidegger’s work
into our work but I did not want to – and in all
reason could not – claim expertise in the subject,
so the students in effect shared the responsibility
with me for introducing such material as well
as for my declaration that I would be, in effect
and in fact, studying it with them, and glad at the
prospect.
The first fruits of this undertaking began
showing up tentatively but incontestably in
passages of my essays written over the second
half of the 1960s and published in Must We
Mean What We Say? in 1969. But I had still not
discovered how to take seriously the intriguing
facts that Heidegger recurrently demonstrated
abiding admiration for Nietzsche while knowing
that Nietzsche loved Emerson’s writing and that
Heidegger knew this. What I had not yet discovered how to take seriously was fundamentally
Emerson’s writing itself. But after I published
my little book on Thoreau’s Walden in 1972,
I knew that I owed myself some explanation of
Emerson’s remaining foreign to me.
Having convinced myself that Walden was
a philosophical text of immeasurable, anyway
unmeasured, quality and achievement, Emerson
nevertheless did not appear in my book on
Thoreau. Yet everyone else who cared about
such things saw that Emerson was indispensable for Thoreau, whereas for me these writers
persistently drowned out each other’s voices.
Thoreau’s voice was endlessly precise, everywhere rooted in the world, where Emerson’s, to
me, was flowers.
A vaguer but perhaps stronger cause of my
avoidance, or lack of hope, in an Emerson connection was his being linked to the one respectable philosopher familiarly associated with him,
namely John Dewey. (Locating Emerson with,
say, Plotinus, or some non-Western mystic, was

227
Emerson invokes the idea of the universe as
“answering to our concepts,” our conditions for
understanding a world; but whereas in Kant the
a priori is definitively exhibited in twelve categories, in Emerson what precedes and conditions
knowledge, and at the same time is an object of
knowledge, is endlessly every word in our language.
And Wittgenstein exists in Emerson in radically
sharing, however otherwise different in philosophical taste, Emerson’s attraction to the low, the
near, the common, the everyday.

`Emerson, Ralph Waldo (1803–1882)
American essayist, poet, and philosopher.
Although his work as a poet and orator has
usually eclipsed his importance as a thinker,
Emerson was one of the first American philosophers of international stature. He was deeply
interested in Nietzsche, who translated some
of his writings and often quoted from them. In
1833 Emerson travelled to England, where he met
several writers of note, including Words-worth,
Coleridge, and Carlyle. In the 1990s he was the
controversial focal point of efforts to bridge
the gap between Anglo-American and European
philosophy and literature, social criticism, and
philosophy, for example, in the writings of Stanley
Cavell, Harold Bloom, Richard Poirier, and
Irving Howe.

`empiricism 
Empiricism is an epistemology
– a theory of the source, nature, and scope of
knowledge. Conforming to, and formative of,
modern “common sense,” empiricism asserts that
knowledge of “matters of fact and real existence”

empiricism

not unfamiliar, and not exactly wrong, but of no
use for me in my search for Emerson as a conversational companion within or, anyway, near
philosophy as it was, and is, established in our
academies.) Of course Emerson and Dewey are
linked in their distrust of academic philosophical problems academically rehearsed (Dewey’s
remoteness here can be called disaffection,
Emerson’s more distant past never so much as
reached to affection), and call this their wish to
bring philosophy out of its devotion to irrelevance
or/and evanescence into entanglement with the
perplexities of human daily existence. But far
from trying to see them as joined in something
to be called versions of pragmatism (this is one
repeated invitation I have never been tempted to
accept, any more than I accept it in the case of
Wittgenstein), I find that Emerson and Dewey are
more obviously and illuminatingly to be understood as intellectual opposites, in two immediate
respects that imply countless others.
I begin from a sense of them each as thinkers
writing out of a sense of philosophical isolation,
actual or imminent, yet each alive to possibilities
of community perpetually missed or refused by
human impatience, or willful impracticality, or by
variously formed desires for intellectual absoluteness or finality (Dewey calls it “the quest for
certainty”; Emerson imagines writing “Whim”
on the lintels of his door posts). Dewey expresses
his philosophical isolation by (if memory serves)
virtually never quoting the words of another
philosopher, as if such persons do not exist or
have quite failed to leave behind them any impressions necessary to follow or specifically,
argumentatively, to confront. One of Emerson’s
characteristic measures against isolation is to form
lists of names of thinkers, ancient and modern,
European and Asian. It seems in him the promise of conversation, with students, with friends,
with strangers at home and abroad.
I do not imagine that the Emersonian text
could so reliably, however still surprisingly,
have counted for me in prompting and expanding philosophical conversation had it not so
regularly echoed and anticipated, directly and
indirectly, guiding perceptions of Kant and of
Wittgenstein, essential figures for me, however different from each other, in expressing my interest
in and my hopes for contemporary philosophy. Kant exists in Emerson in the many ways

empiricism

228
(Hume, 1748, IV (i)) originates in – hence is
founded upon – experience gained through the
senses, and must be vindicated by reference back
to it. Since the source of the ideas which furnish
the materials of knowledge is “sense impressions,”
empiricists (for example, Bacon, Locke, and
Hume) reject the a priori doctrines of rationalism, which maintain that the human mind is
provided with innate ideas from which knowledge
can be derived independently of experience.
As Locke (1690) famously declared, at birth
the mind is a tabula rasa – “white paper, void
of all characters” – upon which the truths of
experience are subsequently inscribed. Whereas
rationalism takes mathematics as its Paradigm
of knowledge, empiricism models it upon experimental natural science, assuming its results to
have been established by induction from (or reference to) what were later called “observation
statements.” Science can treat only of observable
entities – the given “facts” – immediately available to sense perception, and should discard all
untestable abstractions and speculation (those
of metaphysics, for example) as “nothing but
sophistry and illusion” (Hume, 1748, XII (iii)).
The contention between empiricism and
rationalism is as old as philosophy itself, and
has survived Kant’s attempt to reconcile the
competing claims of experience and reason with
his transcendental idealism. However, despite the
slide towards subjectivism and skepticism generated by arguments from experience, empiricism,
codified by John Stuart Mill in his System of
Logic (1843), can be said to have dominated the
philosophy of Science well into the twentieth
century. It attained its most systematic expression
in the Logical positivism of the Vienna Circle
(see Ayer, 1936), which sought to discredit any
propositions about the world which were unamenable to verification by observation, dismissing
Ethics and Aesthetics, along with theology,
as neither true nor false, but simply devoid of
meaning. The task of science – the only practice
that could legitimately claim to provide knowledge
– was the pursuit of explanation by the construction of general laws which stated the causal relations between observable phenomena. Controlled
experimentation or observation, confronting any
theory with the discrete, theory-neutral facts,
would then demonstrate its (in)compatibility
with the relevant evidence. Such procedures

were equally applicable in – indeed, mandatory
for – social theory if it was to be credited with
scientific status.
Positivism – a doctrine of the methodological unity of the sciences subscribed to by the
pioneers of sociology (Comte and Durkheim)
– came under sustained attack from Hermeneutics, which postulated the peculiarity
of the cultural sphere, and hence the specificity
of any “human science” aspiring to an understanding (Verstehen) of it. Insisting upon the
distinction between the Geisteswissenschaften and
the Naturwissenschaften, Dilthey and his successors did not, however, contest the adequacy of
empiricism as an epistemological account of the
natural sciences. That challenge emerged, in a variety of forms, from philosophers and historians
of natural science itself. In the Anglo-American
tradition, it is associated with the work of Kuhn
and Feyerabend (Chalmers, 1978); and in
France, with that of Bachelard and Althusser
(Lecourt, 1975).
Popper (1934) had offered an internal critique
of logical positivism, substituting “falsifiability” for
“verifiability” as the criterion for the demarcation between science and non-science, on the
grounds that even an infinite number of empirical corroborations could not logically confirm
a proposition, whereas falsification would serve
to disprove it. Conceiving science as a process
of “conjecture and refutation” – the equally
indispensable moments of theory construction
and empirical testing – Popper nevertheless continued to accord a decisive role to the latter as “the
impartial arbiter” within and between theories, and
upheld a nonlinear notion of scientific progress
as the gradual accumulation of knowledge by
empirical trial and error. The “sophisticated
falsificationism” advanced by his follower Lakatos
(1974) sought to secure the notion of science
as provisional, fallible knowledge in the light of
ensuing critiques.
In Anglophone philosophy the most corrosive
of these came from Kuhn (1962). Partially converging with the French epistemological tradition
of “rational materialism” – the Bachelardian–
Althusserian prioritization of theoretical “problematics” over experience and experimentation
– Kuhn argued that the empirical indeterminacy
and radical mutability of scientific theory were
attested by the actual – discontinuous – history

229
now of Nietzschean passions.) Thus far, it has
resisted countercritiques from anti-empiricist
and anti-positivist realisms, which seek to distinguish between the anti-empiricist and the
anti-empirical, and to reconcile the social relativity
with the cognitive objectivity of knowledge.
Contemporary anti-empiricism has profound implications for the character and status
of cultural and Literary criticism; for any
Aesthetics which seeks to defend Art (whether
formally “realist” or not) as a mode of knowledge
(see Lovell, 1980); and for questions of aesthetic
value.

critic. Empson was the most brilliant, entertaining, and eccentric representative of the new style
of “close reading” that emerged in the Englishspeaking world in the 1920s and 1930s, and his
Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930) was its Paradigmatic work. Empson never systematically
developed a theoretical position, but he has been
an enormous influence and a continuing one, as
the poststructuralists’ recent rediscovery of him
demonstrates.
Seven Types is a defense of “the analytical mode
of approach” and shows the strong influence of
I.A. Richards. Like Richards, Empson sought
to replace the loosely emotive and “appreciative”
criticism of his day with rigorous and reasoned

Empson, Sir William

of the sciences. Theories were not subject to
empirical acid tests on the basis of atomistic
facts. There was no such thing as theory-neutral
observation/observation statements; the “facts”
were themselves theory-dependent, and thus
could not function as the indubitable foundation
of knowledge. The “correspondence theory of
truth” – truth as agreement between a statement
about an empirical state of affairs and the “way
things actually are” – was untenable. Observation and experimentation were structured by a
Paradigm – the particular conceptual framework
governing “normal science” at any particular time
by virtue of a consensus among the scientific
community. The evaluative criteria posited by
different paradigms were “incommensurable.”
Therefore – at least on a widespread reading of
Kuhn – there could be no rational adjudication between competing theories, and scientific
change did not amount to scientific progress.
Radicalized in the “epistemological anarchism”
of Feyerabend (1975), the category of “incommensurability” was subsequently generalized
from rival scientific theories to the relationship
between scientific and nonscientific Discourses.
If all “knowledge” was a historically and culturally specific product, articulated in an irreducibly conceptual – and hence wholly or partly
untranslatable – language, no neutral arbitration
between the truth claims of different discourses
was available.
Crossed with allied themes – whether from
(Post)structuralism, invoking the linguistics
of Saussure and the genealogy of Nietzsche,
Wittgensteinian philosophy of Language
(for example, the notion of language games), or
“anti-foundationalist” pragmatism, in the work of
Rorty – a hybrid critique of empiricism resonates
widely in Cultural and Critical theory
today. In the shorthand form of the “discursive
construction of reality,” it is frequently taken to
vindicate epistemological perspectivism – the
doctrine that the world is to be interpreted
through a plurality of conceptual Systems, none
of which possesses greater cognitive validity than
any other – and ethical/aesthetic relativism – the
view that there are, and can be, no universal
standards of good and bad. (Such a critique dissolves the fact/value dichotomy of empiricism
by relativizing the first as well as the second
term. But reason remains a Humean slave, albeit

Empson, Sir William

230
argument: “the reasons that make a line of verse
likely to give pleasure, I believe, are like the
reasons for anything else; one can reason about
them.” For Empson that reasoning entailed a
minute dissection of the multiple interdependence
– which he calls “Ambiguity” – of different forms
of meaning in poetry. Richards had written,
“the all-important fact for the study of literature
. . . is that there are several kinds of meaning,”
and Empson pursued the implications of this to
their limit, unpicking a Shakespearean sonnet, for
example, to reveal “a general sense of compacted
intellectual wealth, of an elaborate balance of
variously associated feeling.”
Empson’s essay is closely focused on individual
Texts, and often on tiny parts of those texts,
but implicit in it is an entire revisionist history
of English literature, similar to that of Richards
and T.S. Eliot, and centered like theirs on an
admiration for Renaissance Poetry and a critique
of Romanticism. Implicit in it too, and also
powerfully influential on the way criticism was to
develop, is a pessimistic view of the state of the
English language which “needs nursing by the
analyst very badly indeed” in order to “give back
something of the Elizabethan energy to what is
at present a rather exhausted language.”
Empson’s second book, Some Versions of Pastoral (1935), carried the program further and represented a striking extension of his range. Seven
Types had been essentially a random collection of
texts chosen to show off a particular analytic
method: the method was not systematized and the
texts were rarely related to one another or to their
contexts. Now Empson outlined the social history
of a whole ambiguous Genre, and implicitly
offered that genre as central to English literary culture. Pastoral (the idealizing of the relationship
between rich and poor) had been identified in
passing in Seven Types as one example of the
“clash between different modes of feeling,” but it
was now placed center stage and scanned for its
“latent political ideas.” The result is what later
Marxist critics would call an “ideological reading,”
but one that carefully resists reducing literature
to Ideology. Gray’s Elegy, for example, is seen
both as an expression of “bourgeois ideology”
(since “by comparing the social arrangement to
Nature he makes it seem inevitable, which it was
not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved”)
and as the expression of a “permanent truth” about

the wastefulness of human life. Shakespeare’s
sonnets are analyzed not only to reveal an
underlying “ironical acceptance of aristocracy” but
also as intensely private works.
In Empson’s third book, The Structure of
Complex Words (1951), he was still working
away at ambiguity, and the model of emotional–
intellectual interaction which he had inherited
from Richards. By 1951, however, he had
become more skeptical of Richards’s legacy,
particularly as institutionalized in American
New Criticism. Although the book is offered
as a sketch for “a new kind of dictionary,” its
underlying concern is with the semantic status of
emotion in literature and to attack Richards’s
peculiar and historically damaging doctrine that
“the Emotions given by words in poetry are
independent of their Sense.” By minute semantic and historical analysis, Empson shows the
extraordinary richness of the interplay between
multiple senses and multiple emotions in the
simplest words – “honest” in Othello, for example,
“sense” in The Prelude.
Empson spent most of the 1930s and 1940s in
the Far East, and was alarmed on his return to
England to find that under the ever-increasing
influence of Eliot, the “neo-Christians” had taken
over in the English departments. Much of his
later criticism is designed as a counterattack,
notably in Milton’s God (1961), a lively and controversial polemic against “the torture-horror
and sex-horror” of Christianity in the guise of an
analysis of the Contradictions of the theology
of Paradise Lost.
Several collections of Empson’s essays were
published in his later years and posthumously,
and show him at his polemical best, especially
when up against the neo-Christians, making angry
attempts to rescue Donne’s skepticism from
Dame Helen Gardner or Joyce’s socialism and anticlericalism from Hugh Kenner. All of them, like
his entire life’s work, are wonderfully vigorous,
irreverent, often wildly idiosyncratic attempts
to save Literary criticism from “the habitual
mean-mindedness of modern academic criticism,
its moral emptiness combined with incessant
moral nagging, its scrubbed prison-like isolation,” into which he felt that the influence of Eliot,
Leavis and the more preachifying New Critics had
brought it.

`encoding/decoding 
A model for analyzing
processes of communication, explored particularly
in television research. Drawing on Semiology
and on the writing of Barthes, the approach
suggests that meanings arise from a work of
signification through Codes, of which audiences
make sense in ways which may differ. The model
emphasizes power and conflict in the construction of representations, and tensions between
media organizations and their publics, so that “preferred” meanings may be accepted, negotiated
or opposed in ways linked to not only Class,
Gender, and “ethnicity” but also to positions
in Discourse and to viewing/reading contexts.
Such analyses are difficult and contested (it is
argued that the “codes” are hard to distinguish
and that audience “resistance” has been exaggerated). However, in stressing attempts to secure
“dominant” meanings and even more, the activity of media users has stimulated empirical and
theoretical work, raising important issues.

`end of philosophy 
Fashionable theme pursued by various thinkers who urge that “philosophy” as hitherto conceived (say from Socrates
to Descartes, Kant, and the modern AngloAmerican analytic tradition) no longer has
anything valid, relevant, or interesting to say.
Sources include Nietzsche and Foucault (on
the Genealogy of values and power/knowledge);
Heidegger’s reading of “Western metaphysics”
as an epoch whose closure (or limiting horizon)
supposedly emerges through a depth-ontological
account of that same exhausted tradition; holistic theories of meaning and truth as advanced
by “postanalytical” philosophers like W.V. Quine
and (arguably) Donald Davidson; cultural relativism in its manifold forms, among them
Thomas Kuhn’s philosophy of Science and
the so-called strong program in Sociology of
knowledge; the idea of “weak thinking” ( pensiero debole) aptly thus described by its proponent Gianni Vattimo; and again – subsuming
all these – the widely heralded linguistic (or
Hermeneutic) “turn” in philosophy and other
disciplines inspired by thinkers such as Wittgenstein, Gadamer, and Rorty. The work of
Jacques Derrida is often invoked in this context,
despite his frequent declarations to the contrary,
that is, his insistence that to Deconstruct the
Texts of philosophy means to read them differently – with greater attentiveness and rigor – but
not to indulge in futile gestures of “postphilosophical” abandon. A case can be made (albeit
unconvincingly) that Kant was the first to declare
such an “end of philosophy” with his argument
that certain kinds of speculative metaphysics
exceeded the bounds of rational inquiry and were
therefore to be counted illegitimate. But this current way of thinking is in general characterized
by its downright rejection of all such critical
Enlightenment values (see Postmodermism).

`Engels, Friedrich (1820–95) 
Political economist, activist, and philosopher. Engels’s
importance lies in his collaboration with Karl
Marx to produce a critique of capitalist society
based on a materialistic conception of history,
his attempt to formulate a “scientific” basis for
socialism, his explorations of the connections
between dialectics and natural science, his analyses of working-class conditions, as well as the
development of the family and the state. The
initial dissemination, clarification, and popularization of Marxist ideas owed more to Engels
than to the endeavors of Marx himself.
Born in Barmen, Prussia as the son of a textile
manufacturer, Engels commenced training in
1838 for a business career. But, pursuing his
philosophical and political reading, and moving
to Berlin in 1841, he quickly became influenced
by the thought of Hegel, the dominant figure in
German philosophy. For a while Engels associated
with Bruno Bauer and the Young Hegelians. The
following year was to prove equally decisive in
the formation of Engels’s thought: settling in
Manchester, England, he started work at a factory
in which his father was a shareholder. He saw at
first hand the miserable conditions suffered by
British workers, his research into these conditions
being published as The Conditions of the Working
Class in England in 1845. Here, Engels argued that
the degraded conditions of the English proletariat, generated by its industrial exploitation,
would eventually mold it into a revolutionary
political force.
At this time English labor interests were particularly active and pressing for reform. Chartism
was a widespread movement and the Welsh
utopian social reformer Robert Owen had gained
a following, as had his counterpart Charles
Fourier in France. It was in this agitative climate
that Engels became a socialist. He had already
started to correspond with Marx, whom he had
met in 1844 in Paris. Here, from his own reading of the French socialists as well as Feuerbach,
Marx also had turned to socialism. In early 1844

Engels had published an article “Outlines of a
critique of political economy” in the Deutsch–
Französische Jahrbüher to which Marx had also
contributed two essays. Engels’ argments, charging that private property and accumulation of
capital increased the degradation of the workers
and therefore the class struggle, had alerted Marx
to the importance of economics in historical
analysis.
Engels and Marx produced in the same year
a joint book, The Holy Family, expressing their
now common antagonism against the “Holy
Family” of the brothers Edgar and Bruno Bauer
and their Young Hegelian circle. In an incisive critique, Marx and Engels undermined from every
aspect the views of this circle: its renunciation of
radicalism and espousal of a moderate Liberal
philanthropy; its speculative idealism which
substituted a Hegelian self-consciousness for real
people, with its implication that thought could
somehow generate change; its apriorism and the
sheer inaccuracy of its empirical knowledge of
the working classes; and its self-entrapment in
the “mire” of Christian-Germanic nationalism.
Marx and Engels argued that the proletariat or
masses, so derided by the “absolute criticism” of
Bauer and company, were actually the real agents
of historical change. The difference between
Marx’s and Engels’s materialist approach and
the idealism they attacked was crystalized in
Engels’s pithy statement: “History does nothing,
it ‘possesses no immense wealth’, it ‘wages no
battles’. It is man, real, living man who does all
that . . . history is nothing but the activity of man
pursuing his aims” (Marx and Engels, 1956,
p. 116).
Engels and Marx further collaborated to produce The German Ideology (1846) which marked
their break with Feuerbach’s Materialism and
expressed their own materialistic conception of
history, characterized by a number of features:
(i)

(ii)

it is the activity and conditions of material
production, not mere ideas, which determine the structure of society and the nature
of individuals; law, Art, religion, and morality are an efflux of these material relations;
the evolution of division of labor issues in
the concentration of private property, a
conflict between individual and communal
interests (the latter assuming the status of

Between 1845 and 1847 Engels lived in Brussels
and Paris where he and Marx, attempting to
forge international working-class cooperation,
were commissioned by the German Communist
League to set forth the main tenets of Communism. The result was The Communist Manifesto
of 1848. This astonishingly compressed book
described the victorious revolution of the bourgeoisie against feudalism, the principles of
capitalist society, centered on private property, the
need for expansion of markets, and the reduction
of all human relations, including family and
Gender relations, to commercial relations. It
expressed also the aims of the Communists: to
abolish not only private property but also the other
foundational institutions of capitalism such as
nation, state, and Class itself.
In 1848 revolutions broke out in France and
elsewhere in Europe. Both Engels and Marx
returned to Prussia where their democratic journal
was eventually suppressed. Marx was deported and
Engels took part in the armed popular struggle
against the reactionary and victorious counterrevolution. Both soon returned to England,
Engels settling as a clerk in Manchester until
1870 while Marx lived in London. Their collaboration continued, however, Engels also providing his friend with financial support. Engels
pursued his interest in the natural sciences from
a historical materialist standpoint, his observations
eventually being published in the 1920s as
Dialectics of Nature (Engels, 1939). The themes of
these essays include development of the natural
sciences in both inorganic and organic realms,

the historical connections between science and
religion, spiritualism, and the poverty of naive
Empiricism. Engels traces the development of
the scientific “revolution” to the period of the
Reformation and Renaissance, where thinkers
had universal interests, not being in thrall to
the modern bourgeois division of labor. At that
time, says Engels, science was revolutionary,
especially in emancipating itself from theology.
However, by the first half of the eighteenth
century, science offered a conservative vision of
nature as eternal and immutable rather than
historical. In this domain advances were made
by French materialism and in particular by
Kant, who attempted to explain the solar system
as a process, possessing a history, rather than as
something created by God. Through such figures
as Laplace and Herschel, science eventually
accommodated Kant’s insights. It was through
Darwin and his contemporaries that nature was
shown to be in eternal flux; hence modern
thought returned to the outlook of the great
Greek philosophers. Only with man, says Engels,
do we enter history in so far as this is self-created
through material production. Yet the modern
technologized bourgeois subjugation of nature
has produced increasing misery of the masses, the
much-lauded free competition between human
beings actually being the normal state of the
animal kingdom as described by Darwin.
Engels effectively places man within a materialist cosmology: the cycle of matter is eternal
and indestructible, thinking humanity being but
one of its changing faces. He views nature as
proving the truth of dialectics: it does not merely
revolve in a recurring circle but also undergoes
genuine change (see Materialism). Engels’s
views here arguably reflect the limitations of
nineteenth-century science, a point stressed by
those such as Lukács, who have charged him
with Positivism. Engels’s work on science and
dialectics in general has generated much controversy, especially some of his comments on the
scientific status of Marx’s economic “laws” and
the inevitability of their operation. These have
helped inspire deterministic readings of Marxism.
Retiring in 1870 to London where Marx was
suffering from ill health, Engels continued alone
as leader of the First International, founded by
Marx in 1864 to unite workers’ movements of all
countries. He produced Anti-Dühring (Engels,

Engels, Friedrich

an independent power as the state), and
estrangement or Alienation of social
activity;
(iii) all struggles within the state are euphemisms
for the real struggle between classes; it is this
struggle which generates social change;
(iv) once technologically assisted capitalist
accumulation, concentration, and world
expansion have led to a world of sharply
contrasting wealth and poverty, and working classes become conscious of their
historical role, capitalism itself will yield
to a communism which will do away with
private property and base itself on human
need rather than the greed of a minority for
increasing profit.

1939), a polemical tract directed against Eugen
Dühring of Berlin University, who in propounding his own socialist theory had attacked Marx.
In the course of expounding his own and Marx’s
socialist principles (extending through natural
science, morality, and political economy), Engels
attacked the socialist state envisaged by Dühring,
which would effectively replicate the gendarmerie
of the existing Prussian state. According to
Engels, Dühring’s insistence that religion should
be prohibited in his future state represented a naive
misunderstanding of the dialectical nature of
economic forces and the fact that religion was
but one form of Alienation which would die a
natural death. In primitive societies, suggests
Engels, men had externalized forces of nature,
which were reflections of their own mentalities.
In more developed societies, social forces emerge
as equally alien. In bourgeois society God is “the
alien domination of the capitalist mode of production.” Dühring does not understand that it
is not knowledge but social action, namely the
repossession of the means of production, which
will bring social forces under the domination of
society rather than appearing as something foreign and transcendent. An abridged version of
Engels’s book appeared in 1880 under the title
Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Engels, 1975).
Translated into at least ten languages, this enjoyed
a wider circulation among working-class movements than even the Communist Manifesto.
In the year after Marx’s death in 1883, Engels
wrote The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (Engels, 1972), a text widely
regarded as the pivotal Marxist document for
feminist theory since it alone, among the works
of Marx and Engels, offers a comprehensive
attempt to explain the origins of Patriarchy.
Lewis H. Morgan’s Ancient Society (1877), from
its research into prehistoric Native American
Systems of kinship, had arrived at similar conclusions to Marx’s in his critique of a society
based on commodity production. Drawing on
this book and Marx’s own detailed notes on it,
Engels traced the rise of patriarchy through
increasingly sophisticated economic and social
configurations, from primitive communal systems to a class society based on private property.
Following Morgan’s schematization, Engels
describes three main forms of marriage, conforming to three stages of human development:

“for the period of savagery, group marriage;
for barbarism, pairing marriage; for civilization,
monogamy supplemented by adultery and prostitution” (Engels, 1972, p. 105). In the tribe,
descent and inheritance occurred through the
female line. However, as wealth increased, the man
acquired a more important status in the family
than the woman, and this “mother right” was
eventually overthrown in what Engels sees as a
momentous revolution in prehistory: “The overthrow of mother right was the world historical
defeat of the female sex” (Engels, 1972, p. 87). Engels
says that, with the predominance of private
property over common property, father right
and monogamy gained ascendancy, marriage
becoming increasingly dependent on economic
considerations. Because of the economic dependence of the woman on the man in bourgeois
society, the husband “is the bourgeois, and the wife
represents the proletariat” (Engels, 1972, p. 105).
Engels suggests that the first premise for the
emancipation of women is the reintroduction of
the entire female sex into public industry, and that
when the means of production become common
property, the individual family will cease to be the
economic unit of society. The economic foundations of monogamy as it presently exists will
vanish, along with the institutions of the state
which preserved them.
In 1886 Engels wrote Ludwig Feuerbach and the
End of Classical German Philosophy, in which he
attempted to broach once again a subject only
sporadically addressed during his 40 years of collaboration with Marx since The German Ideology:
the relation of historical materialism to Hegel.
Engels’s treatment is comprehensive, elucidating
the Hegelian dialectic and its historical division into conservative and radical factions, a
dichotomy inhering in its revolutionary form
and reactionary content. He also addresses more
fully the limitations of Feuerbach’s Materialism and morality which are “cut exactly to the
pattern of modern capitalist society.” He offers
acute analyses of ideological developments, especially in religion and law; as for philosophy in
Germany, it is at the end of its tether, the 1848
revolution marking the eclipse of idealist theory
by revolutionary practice: “The German working class movement is the inheritor of German
classical philosophy” (Marx and Engels, 1968,
p. 622).

and historical concerns of the Germans (Goethe,
Herder, Lessing, Schiller).
In the period since the 1939–45 war, the idea
of the Enlightenment has increasingly become
the battleground for disputes over the concept
of reason and the progressive or oppressive
character of the heritage of European Culture.
More recently, it has provided the focus for
debates between the followers of Foucault and
Habermas, in which both sides understand the
Enlightenment as the project of Modernity.

`Enlightenment 
An eighteenth-century cultural movement which attacked the authority of
tradition, especially in matters of church and
state, in the name of the public use of reason. Kant
famously defined the Enlightenment as “man’s
emergence from his self-imposed immaturity,” and
gave its motto as sapere aude! – “Dare to understand!” The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide
phenomenon, associated with the decline of feudalism, the growth of printing, and the increasing
economic and social power of the bourgeois
classes. It is important to note the national
differences between its forms, in particular,
the Materialism of the French Encyclopedists
(d’Alembert, Diderot, Helvetius, Holbach), the
Scottish interest in political economy (Fergerson,
Hume, Smith, Stuart), and the more cultural

`enterprise culture 
Ideological term developed
in 1980s political debate, particularly in Britain
(where “enterprise culture”) was often taken to
describe American culture). The term was used
in two ways. On the one hand, it referred to the
social conditions necessary to promote “enterprise,” defined here in straight capitalist terms as
the willingness to take a financial risk. It was
argued (by Margaret Thatcher, for example) that
enterprise was not just a response to market
incentives but also depended on an attitude, an
attitude embodying self-sufficiency, an identification of one’s family with one’s property
(and vice versa), and a hostility to socialism, to
all forms of state dependency, and indeed, to
the very idea of “society.” And this fed into the
second use of the term: “enterprise culture” also
described the Culture of the new, 1980s
entrepreneurs, the culture of competitive, hardworking, self-driven, anti-establishment greed
depicted in the film Wall Street and given the
popular label of “yuppie.”

At this late stage of his life Engels was active
in the formation of the Second International.
He undertook the additional labor of editing and
publishing the second and third volumes of
Marx’s Capital in 1885 and 1884 respectively. He
began work on the fourth volume, uncompleted,
however, because of his death, and eventually
published as Theories of Surplus Value. All in all,
despite his modesty, Engels exerted considerable
influence on Marx’s thought and life. In his
speech at Marx’s graveside, Engels had emphasized
Marx’s combination of intellectual gifts with
practical commitment: he was not only “the
greatest living thinker” but “before all else a revolutionist.” In his own clarity of moral vision,
intellectual subtlety, and political daring, Engels
was not far behind.

The use of the term “entertainment industry”

implies, rather, an interest in management structure and business practice (compare the term

`erotica 
The term “erotica” is used most broadly
to describe literature, art, and other media that
contain sexual or amatory content. It is thus a
category of eroticism that specifically designates
media, although erotic media are often believed
inextricably linked to erotic behavior. Further,
erotica is a term used, often problematically,
to distinguish “high-brow” sexual media from
consumerist, mass-produced pornography. It is
common to refer to the writing and study of
erotic literature as the writing and study of
erotica. Erotica is thus associated with imaginative textual/visual play, whereas pornography is
deemed repetitive, exploitative, and utilitarian.
Erotica is considered a “softer-core” version of
pornography, which is believed more explicit
and literal in its representations of sex. Yet such
sharp distinctions do not hold up under closer
scrutiny, particularly when one treats erotica as
a closed or fixed generic category. The work of
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe (1946–89)
provides a particularly instructive example of this
problem: Mapplethorpe’s highly stylized homoerotic images are widely recognized as having
artistic and intellectual merit, yet Mapplethorpe
works have been confiscated, banned, and protested as pornographic, exploitative materials.
“Erotica” and “pornography” are both words that
enter into common usage in the mid-nineteenth
century. Contemporary historians of sexuality
apply both terms somewhat anachronistically – and
often, interchangeably – to describe any literature
or art that contains explicitly erotic content. Yet
the distinction between “high-brow” erotica and
“low-brow” pornography is largely a construction
of late twentieth-century theory, particularly of
the anti-pornography feminist movement of the
1970s and 1980s. Prior to such enforced distinctions, the erotic as a broader generic category
had a long and rich history, tied into humanist
discourses of the self and the passions, into

237
viewer, or consumer of pornography, is a principal actor, complicit in the unfolding violence.
MacKinnon and Dworkin’s controversial rejection of all erotic media prompted a more nuanced
response from critics like Diana Russell, who
proposed a distinction between pornography
(as a legally actionable form of violence) and
erotica (as a space for safe, imaginative, and
even instructional sexual play). Russell thus
defines pornography as “material that combines
sex and/or the exposure of genitals with abuse
or degradation in a manner that appears to
endorse, condone, or encourage such behavior”;
erotica, alternatively, is “sexually suggestive or
arousing material that is free of sexism, racism,
and homophobia and is respectful of all human
beings and animals portrayed.” Under this definition, erotica might comprise everything from
sexual education videos to documentaries on
insect breeding. Yet Russell’s definition of erotica
inverts the problem of MacKinnon’s definition
of pornography: while, in MacKinnon’s view,
the very act of consuming erotic media is a perpetuation of violence, Russell seems to almost
neutralize the role of the viewer in her suggestion
that a definition can be arrived at solely based on
content. Russell’s depoliticized erotica is problematic because it does not take into account
the viewers’ role in shaping how the material is
consumed.
Indeed, to call erotica a milder and more
“acceptable” pornography is to rob it of its viscera, its intentionality, and its capacity for social
and political critique. Audre Lorde (1934–92), in
her book The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power
(1984), sees erotica as possessed of a sensibility
that distinguishes it from the pornographic, a
kind of affective connection that pornography
both minimizes and diffuses. Lorde says that
“pornography is a direct denial of the power of
the erotic,” as it “emphasizes sensation without
feeling.” Erotica is thus an affective, creative
medium, accessible both affectively and aesthetically. For Lorde, erotica can be an empowering outlet for women, and particularly lesbian
women, in learning to express their sexuality
separately from the discourses of patriarchy and
of oppression that she believes pornography
replicates and enacts. Lorde celebrates the erotic
as “an assertion of the lifeforce of women; of that
creative energy empowered, the knowledge and

erotica

Enlightenment discourses of sensibility and affect,
and into the explosive Revolutionary rhetoric
of the body politic. In the early modern period,
the erotic was the common subject of esteemed
painters (Titian [?–1576] and Marcantonio
Raimondi [1480–1534]), of philosophes (Denis
Diderot [1713–1784] and Rétif de la Bretonne
[1734–1806]), and of bawdy broadsheets alike.
The erotic often blended the visual and literary
arts: the famous “postures” of Pietro Aretino
(1492–1556) were illustrated by Raimondi in a
series of wood-cut engravings, and lewd frontispieces and illustrations were common accompaniments to popular erotic texts, including
L’École des filles (1668), Fanny Hill, or the Memoirs
of a Woman of Pleasure (1748), and the works of
the Marquis de Sade. Our contemporary tendency
to associate pornography almost exclusively with
visual media, and erotica with written or other
stylized media, is thus an untenable distinction
at other moments in the history of sexuality.
In the United States in the 1970s and 1980s,
the effort to distinguish pornography from
erotica became politically charged in the wake
of the anti-pornography ordinances. Andrea
Dworkin (1946–2005) and Catharine MacKinnon
(b. 1946), two prominent feminist activists,
decried all erotic media as “an institution of male
dominance that sexualizes hierarchy, objectification, submission, and violence.” Dworkin and
MacKinnon supported a largely conservative
ban on pornography with legal ordinances that
circumscribed the production and distribution of
erotic materials. MacKinnon, particularly, links the
act of viewing or consuming pornography with
the sexual act itself: “Pornography,” she writes in
Only Words (1993), “is masturbation material. It
is used as sex. It therefore is sex.” Because she does
not distinguish between the act of consuming
erotic media and a sexual act, MacKinnon can
argue that pornography is legally actionable as
a form of rape. Because pornography is (and
therefore, does not stand in for) the sexual act,
the media itself becomes “evidence” of abuse.
“Representation,” MacKinnon claims, “is reality
. . . pornography is no less an act than the rape
and torture it represents.” Thus she dismisses
any potential signifying or imaginative function
of pornography: for her, it is an “act” of physical
domination, of sexual subjugation, and of political degradation. In MacKinnon’s formulation, the

essentialism

238
use of which we are now reclaiming in our language, our history, our dancing, our loving, our
work, our lives.” This definition emphasizes the
aesthetic pleasures of the erotic: its permeation
into language, into “work” and other forms of
artistic expression. Though Lorde preserves the
distinction between pornography and erotica,
she argues for erotica as the more powerful form
of political critique, as an alternative to maledominated paradigms of female sexuality.
Erotica is unquestionably political, and has
been throughout its history. Erotic images were
often used to lewdly parody political figures in
early modern Europe, or even to argue for their
potency and fecundity. Erotica often takes as
its subject the political exploitation of bodies
through a representation of their sexual subjugation, submission, or even power. Michel
Foucault famously argues against a “repressive
hypothesis” of sexuality in The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1, and thus against the misconception
of theorists like MacKinnon and Dworkin that
systems of power – such as patriarchy – are
totalitarian, material entities capable of being
dismantled only through direct opposition, or
“power-as-law.” Foucault challenges this concept
by representing power as variable and omnipotent, “not because it has the privilege of consolidating everything under its invincible unity, but
because it is produced from one moment to the
next, at every point, or rather in every relation
from one point to another.” Domna C. Stanton
has similarly argued that “ ‘repressive’ and ‘progressive’ sexual trends or phenomena are both
enmeshed in networks and relations of power, and,
to (sometimes radically) different degrees, are
complicitous with dominant forces.” Stanton’s
observation that anti-pornography feminism
became closely aligned with right-wing repressive
discourses speaks to the relational character of
power that Foucault advocates.
Foucault expands his insight: “Relations of
power are not in a position of exteriority with
respect to other types of relationships (economic
processes, knowledge relationships, sexual relations) but are immanent in the latter.” He thus
argues that power is “immanent in” the sexual
acts that erotica both articulates and reifies. For
Foucault, the erotic is a display of power relations,
not an effect of them. While anti-pornography
feminism may seek to demonstrate the ways in

which patriarchal authority is consolidated in
the representations of sexual media, Foucault
would argue that such a clear demarcation –
between text and “reality,” between sex and
power – does not, and cannot, exist. The erotic
is a discourse of sexuality that is both repressive
and resistant, a space of negotiation in a network
of other power relations. Erotica is the discursive
field within which these negotiations are enacted
and replicated.
In the late twentieth and early twenty-first
centuries, literary erotica has experienced a
renaissance, particularly in the gay and lesbian
community. Collections and anthologies of erotic
short stories, such as Best Women’s Erotica and
Best American Erotica, have become increasingly
popular in recent decades. Other sub-genres of
erotic writing, such as “slash” and “fanfic,” in
which writers fantasize erotic encounters between
established characters on cult television shows
and movies (for example, Star Trek, the Harry
Potter and Lord of the Rings series, and Buffy the
Vampire Slayer) have also gained in popularity,
particularly in the past decade. The proliferation
of writing about sex seems to fulfill Foucault’s
prescient understanding of modern society as a
discursive network throbbing with erotic feeling:
“Rather than the uniform concern to hide sex,”
he writes, “rather than a general prudishness
of language, what distinguishes these last three
centuries is the variety, the wide dispersion of
devices that were invented for speaking about it,
for having it be spoken about, for inducing it
to speak of itself, for listening, recording, transcribing, and redistributing what is said about it:
around sex, a whole network of varying, specific,
and coercive transpositions into discourse.”

`essentialism 
Minimally, the doctrine that
particular things necessarily possess essences or

239
challenged, as in the work of Thomas Hobbes
(1588–1679) and John Locke (1632–1704) the
twin tenets of essentialism: first, by insisting that
essences concern the names of things, not their
“natures” (Hobbes); second, by insisting that in
so far as things have real essences, their essences
are unknown, and that the “nominal” essences
by which we guide ourselves are verbal and
sufficient for our scientific inquiries (Locke).
Furthermore, the question arises, particularly
among the medievals, of whether universals, the
generic structures – whether apart from particular things or manifested in or only in particular
things or imposed by the mind on aggregated
things or identified merely in the general use
of names (what have come to be variously called
the doctrines of realism, conceptualism, and
nominalism regarding universals) – themselves
exist. The plausibility of choosing among these
alternatives seems enhanced by admitting a
supreme Creator. Nevertheless, in modern times,
predicables as opposed to particulars (or things)
are, for instance, in the apt distinction developed
by Charles Sanders Peirce, real but not existent.
We should now say that if they obtain in the world,
predicables (as real) answer to predicates (which
are then their names), whereas proper names
(“Sir Walter Scott”), definite descriptions (“the
author of Waverley”) and indexicals (“this,”
“that”) denote particulars or individual things
(actual or existent or, more disputably, fictional
or imaginary). On Peirce’s view, therefore,
predicables are real but do not exist. What exists,
Peirce says, manifests secondness, that is, resists
us or other existing things, as by the actual
weight of a heavy table that one attempts to
move; whereas what is real is what, as we judge,
may be found in the world independently of our
particular existence and mode of understanding,
even if only by our inquiry. These are said by
Peirce to exhibit thirdness. On this view, there
are (exist) no universals, though there are “real
generals.” Hence essentialism can survive the
rejection of universals.
The deeper question regarding essences (or
essential predicables) concerns: (i) whether there
are real generals, whether generality is real and
in what way real; and (ii) whether essences, even
real generals, are necessary to the existence of real
particulars (that is, what exists is said to be real,
but what is real need not exist). Now then, the

essentialism

fixed natures in virtue of which they are what
they are: particular things of determinate kinds.
The idea is that nothing can remain one and
the same, validly reidentifiable as such, if its
assignable nature is lost or altered (as when a tree,
cut down for lumber, loses its specific nature,
being-a-tree, though it retains its generic nature
as wood). There is no single version of essentialism universally acknowledged to be true. Plato, for
example, appears to have held that the things of
the inconstant natural world lack all fixity, hence
lack essences; nevertheless, their intelligibility
presupposes and depends upon our grasping,
through doxa (opinion), the changeless forms
that natural things imperfectly “imitate.” Aristotle,
who is generally conceded to be the author
(particularly in Metaphysics) of the classic form
of essentialism, holds that real particulars, things,
ousiai, necessarily have fixed natures. Unlike
Plato, Aristotle appears to believe that these
“natures” or essences do not exist apart, but are
manifested only in the changing or changeless
things of the real world. Humans, Aristotle says,
possess an intuitive theorizing power of reason
(nous) for directly discerning the essences of
things: this, in effect, is the necessary condition
of Aristotelian science. In contemporary theories
of science, notably in the view of Karl Popper,
the thesis that natural events and phenomena
are governed by exceptionless universal laws of
nature and that human investigators are capable
of discerning such laws is said to be tantamount
to essentialism. Hence doubts about the realist
interpretation of the laws of nature (as by Bas van
Fraassen, 1941–) are, effectively, doubts about
certain forms of essentialism.
In Aristotle, therefore, essentialism concerns
both the reality of a thing and its intelligibility.
Aristotle is not inflexibly insistent on the thesis
in all domains of inquiry. For instance, in the
biological sciences he appears to be more concessive (than in the purely physical sciences)
regarding the provisionality of assigned essences;
and in the arts and practical life, though practical
reason as well as theoretical reason is in some not
always entirely clear sense tethered to essences,
human activity may actually proceed without
invoking the powers of demonstrative science
(hence, without essences). In the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the rise of modern nominalism (associated with British Empiricism)

essentialism

discussion of what exists (in the modern sense),
particularly regarding individuation, numerical
identity, and reidentification under conditions
of change does not appear to have been adequately pursued until comparatively late in the
history of philosophy: first, with the clarification
of the meaning of “exists” (as in Immanuel
Kant’s (1724–1804) opposition to the famous
Ontological Proof of God’s existence and, much
later, in the development of modern notions
of a predicative calculus, with Gottlob Frege
(1848–1925)). Kant’s work supports a very
strong disjunction between contingent claims of
existence and sheer intelligibility; and Frege’s
pioneer work in formalizing logic draws attention to the important difference between purely
syntactic and semantic issues, even where they
prove inseparable (as in Frege’s famous discussion
of identities: “a = a” and “a = b”).
Aristotle formulated (in Metaphysics Book
Gamma) the strongest form of essentialism,
arguing that what is real is changeless; that
particular things subject to change (ousiai ) are
real (that is, exist) in virtue of their possessing
invariant natures (or essences); and that the
denial of the second condition necessarily leads
to Contradiction or incoherence. That claim
is easily demonstrated to be false, that is, the
modal claim that essences are necessary to what
is real and that the denial is self-contradictory. If
nominalism or conceptualism or, less radically,
doctrines like those attributed to Plato, Hobbes,
and Locke (above) may be admitted, then
Aristotle’s thesis fails. One may in fact say that a
large part of the history of Western philosophy
has been occupied with testing the coherence
of denying both strong and weak versions of
essentialism.
There are, in effect, two very large strategies
that challenge the necessity – and beyond that, the
plausibility – of essentialism. One concerns the
analysis of real predicables (general attributes);
the other concerns the analysis of entities and
phenomena belonging to the artifactual world of
human Culture, hence perhaps also extending
to the “natural” world to the extent that it too is,
in some measure, an “artifact” or “construction”
of human culture. The first addresses the deep
problem that the theory of universals ultimately
ignored, namely how precisely we justify extending a predicate term to new instances beyond the

Paradigms by which what they designate is first
introduced. In a post-Kantian world, that is, in a
world in which there is no principled disjunction
between the conditions of our understanding
the way the world is structured and the way the
world is actually structured, general predicates
and predicables are, in some in-eluctable way,
artifactual, but not for that reason arbitrary.
Furthermore, if the conditions of human understanding are themselves historicized, so that the
concepts and categories by means of which we
understand the world are artifacts of our changing history, then it begins to appear plausible
(arguably, even ineluctable) that Discourse may
behave coherently without adhering to essentialism. And if, with regard to the second strategy,
whatever belongs to the world of human culture
– persons, artworks, actions, institutions, language, and the like – are themselves historicized
artifacts, then certainly the original modal thesis
(that essentialism favors) cannot be shown to
hold. Roughly speaking, the treatment of both
of these strategies at the end of the twentieth
century is at the very least hospitable to the
coherence of denying essentialism.
A specimen alternative will be helpful here. It
may be fairly argued that on Ludwig Wittgenstein’s (1889–1951) “later” view, the defensible
extension of general terms to new cases depends
upon and is a function of the social practices
(of language and institutionalized life) that
Wittgenstein collects as Lebensformen. That is,
whether, say, a color term or a term designating
a style of painting or the recognizable interests
of political parties or the like is correctly or
justifiably extended to new cases cannot be determined except consensually (but not, for that
reason, criterially) in accordance with what a
functioning society is able and willing to tolerate
as a valid extension. Furthermore, if this general
lebensformlich account is historicized in some
way that belongs to the themes of post-French
Revolutionary thought – as in accordance, say,
with Karl Marx, or Hans-Georg Gadamer, or
Michel Foucault, or others, then the range of
consensual tolerance will itself vary from society
to society and from one time to another within
the same society. Under such circumstances,
essentialism will fail. For present purposes, it is
enough to see that the option is coherent and perhaps even descriptively true of known societies.

241

`estrangement 
This term has undergone a
considerable history of attempted clarification,
conducted especially with a view to distinguishing it from Alienation, its habitual synonym.
Although the concept is present in earlier writers
such as Rousseau, it first acquires a central status
in the Writings of Hegel and Marx. The
German word used by Hegel in The Phenomenology of Spirit to denote “estrangement” overlaps
in its meaning with the terms used to designate
“externalization” and “objectification.” All of these
notions belong to the second stage of Hegel’s
dialectic: an entity which in the first stage is
apprehended as merely given and self-identical
is viewed in the second stage as “self-estranged”
or “externalized”, its identity being comprised
by the totality of relations into which it enters.
The third stage abrogates this estrangement and
restores identity, in a larger, mediated, and universal sense.
In his Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts
of 1844 (1959 (1981)), Marx praises this dialectic
for recognizing that human beings create the
objective world through labor, but criticizes it for
its purely speculative supersession of estrangement;
Marx makes a crucial distinction between mere
objectification or externalization and estrangement or alienation. The latter is a specific social
condition associated with the bourgeois world,
and especially private property: the individual
experiences the products of his own labor, and
the entire “objective” world, including the state,
as alien to him. This estrangement, says Marx,
can be abolished only “practically,” by revolution.
The concept of estrangement has also had a wide
currency in sociology, psychology, and certain
areas of philosophy such as Existentialism.

`ethics 
Ethics is the branch of philosophy
which studies the nature and criteria of right and
wrong action, obligation, value and the good
life, and related principles. Throughout its history
it has been a normative and critical discipline,
concerned with not only the analysis of concepts
but also justifications and principles of how life
should be lived. Usually without seeking to supply advice about immediate particularities (in
the manner of preachers or agony columns), it has
always retained a relevance to practical principles,
whether at the level of individual action or
political policy. Thus principles of ethics necessarily underlie social and political philosophy,
disciplines concerned ultimately with the ethics
of power and the ethics of Social formations
and practices.
More colloquially, “ethics” is used of the
morals of various societies or the moral standards
implicit in their behavior. In this sense, ethics is
as various as humanity. Importantly, ethics (in this
sense) is perennially open to appraisal by ethics
(in the sense defined above).
History of Ethics Ethics cannot be understood
independently of its historical development. The
connections between ethics, society, and politics
were recognized in the ancient world by Plato
and Aristotle. Seeking to reply to the relativism
and skepticism of the Sophists, Plato argued that
instances of goodness participate in the universal Form of the Good, instances of justice in the
Form of the Just, etc., and that these Forms are
among the proper objects of human knowledge.
The Forms exist independently of governments
and the gods, which may thus be appraised
(and found wanting) by thinkers who study the
Forms.
Aristotle was another objectivist, but unlike
Plato held that the Forms exist only in particular instances. He taught that the virtues are
learnable dispositions to choose the reasonable
mean between extremes of feeling and behavior.

ethics

In effect, what this means is that the particulars
that we identify in discourse can be assigned
properties (predicables) without being assigned
fixed natures or essences, and that as long as such
“natures” can be managed consensually in historically changing ways (as just noted, speaking
of predication), without invoking essences, then
essentialism (in its modal form) is demonstrably
false and (in its descriptive nonmodal form)
decidedly implausible.

The good life entails developing the distinctive
function of the human soul, that is, reason, and
this requires the development of practical wisdom,
and therewith the virtues, and ideally of theoretical wisdom (that is, metaphysics). Aristotle’s
works concerning Ethics and Politics form a sequence, the Politics concerning the kind of political
arrangements appropriate for the development of
the virtues as analyzed in the Ethics.
When Aristotle’s Ethics was rediscovered in
the Middle Ages, the Christian philosopher
Thomas Aquinas found his teleological approach
congenial, but adapted his account of virtue and
the good life, such that the Christian virtues of
faith, hope, and charity were included alongside
the cardinal virtues of courage, prudence, temperance, and justice. The highest form of the
good life now involved the contemplation of
God.
Early modern philosophers, however,
responded differently to ancient influences.
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) inferred from his
reading of the Greek historian Thucydides that
self-preservation is the universal motive, and
(influenced by Euclid) held that moral principles
are to be deduced from axioms such as the sole
desirability of one’s own good. The rational
course is to enter a contract consisting of common principles if others will do the same. One
principle is that individuals contract to obey (with
minimal qualifications) a sovereign authority for
the sake of common security (Hobbes, 1651).
Contractarianism has recently been revived (in
more liberal guise) by John Rawls (1971).
In the following century the ancient philosophy of Epicureanism (which held that pleasure
and the absence of pain is the only good) was
revised as utilitarianism, the doctrine that the
criterion of right action (or rules governing right
action) is the production of the greatest available
balance of pleasure over pain. Like Epicureanism
(which was often employed to criticize the ethics
taught by official religions in the ancient world),
utilitarianism was deployed (by philosophers like
Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) and John Stuart
Mill (1806–1873)) to conduct rational critiques
of the established order.
Meanwhile Immanuel Kant (1724–1804),
influenced rather by the stress of the ancient
Stoics on humanity’s capacity for rationality
and on the rightness of the rational, taught that

rightness is unrelated to the consequences of
action. Only those acts are right whose maxim
could desirably become a universal law, that is,
which could be adopted universally. Expressed like
this, the “categorical imperative” has been charged
with contentless Formalism, but this charge
does not apply to Kant’s alternative formulation,
which enjoins agents to treat humanity as an
end and never as a means only. This particular
approach attracted widespread support during
the twentieth century.
Among Continental philosophers of the nineteenth century, Friedrich Nietzsche’s advocacy
of a transvaluation of values remains influential.
In the twentieth century, existentialists such as
Jean-Paul Sartre castigated the bad faith of
accepting others’ judgments (what Kant would call
“heteronomy”), urging an authenticity which
recognizes no preexisting principles; all values are
created anew in acts of choice. While both these
approaches presuppose unacknowledged values,
their impact has often enlivened much of the
philosophy of more analytic traditions.
Issues in Contemporary Ethics Twentieth-century
ethics focused for several decades on metaethics,
that is questions concerning the objectivity and
status of moral and valuational Discourse, and
this debate continues. Cognitivists hold that the
language of morality and values admits of truth
and (sometimes) knowledge. One kind of cognitivism is naturalism, which maintains that at
least some ethical terms are translatable into
factual language, whether empirical or metaphysical. This view, however, is widely held to
include the “naturalistic fallacy” (G.E. Moore,
1903), roughly the “fallacy” of defining language
which is indefinable and has a peculiar meaning
of its own.
Cognitivists (including G.E. Moore), believing that naturalism is fallacious, adopted nonnaturalism, the belief that at least some moral
properties are neither complex and analyzable
properties, nor natural (for example empirical),
but simple and irreducible. Moore’s account of
how the presence of goodness, construed as a simple, unanalyzable quality, can be apprehended,
is that this is achieved by acts of intuition.
Philosophers unconvinced by this moral epistemology have often concluded that nonnatural
properties belonging to a kind of their own are

243
of morality itself supplies limits to the grounds
which may be adduced in moral discourse.
Accordingly there can be a basis for truth claims
in ethics after all.
Yet others have contended that it is only
within moral traditions or moral practices that
moral reasoning is valid, that these traditions
are what gives life its meaning, and that to step
outside them is to forgo the kind of context
in which moral discourse makes sense. Sometimes this communitarian position is allied to an
Aristotelian account of ethics in terms of the
virtues proper to the various traditions or practices, as in the recent work of A.C. MacIntyre
(1988). Other defenders of an Aristotelian
emphasis on the virtues maintain that there is
enough in common between the experiences of
life of all human communities for at least some
of the virtues to be universal, and defend them
on a nonrelative basis (Nussbaum, 1993).
Normative Ethics Where first-order principles of
obligation and right action are concerned, the
approach based on rights should be mentioned
alongside the utilitarian, contractarian, and
Kantian approaches. While all approaches recognize various (derivative) rights, this approach
makes rights fundamental, whether as presocial human rights, grounded in an individual’s
humanity, as natural rights, bestowed by God or
nature, or as self-evident rights, presupposed in
people’s widespread discomfort at any overriding
of individual needs or interests. Adherents of
this rights-as-premises approach have included
John Locke in the seventeenth century and
Robert Nozick in the twentieth. Problems of this
approach include the resolution of disagreements
concerning the identity of such fundamental
rights, and the contradictions arising when the fundamental rights of different individuals conflict.
Contractarian approaches, as in Rawls (1971),
have the advantage of supplying a decision
procedure by appeal to contract-making situations. However, they encounter the problems
that the interests of non-rational parties are apt
to be omitted, and that representatives of future
generations cannot be included in the contract,
since the contract determines how many such
generations there will be. Also their attempt to
derive moral principles from the preferences of
self-interested agents has been widely criticized

ethics

not properties at all, and have resorted to
noncognitivism.
In one of its forms, emotivism, noncognitivism claimed that there are no truths in moral
discourse, and thus no propositions either; moral
discourse rather serves to express the feelings
of the utterer and generate similar feelings in
hearers. While factual claims are presupposed, this
discourse has more in common with utterances
like “hurrah” and “boo” than with a search for
truth, and similarly it typically employs persuasive definitions in the attempt to exercise
partisan influence. This kind of position, however,
came widely to be seen as incapable of providing for the scope of reason in moral discourse
or the requirement that one’s judgments be
consistent.
By widespread consent an improved form of
noncognitivism was prescriptivism, as put forward by R.M. Hare (1981). For Hare the primary
meaning of moral discourse consists in guiding action, in the strong sense of prescribing,
whether for others or for oneself, which actions
(etc.) are to be done. Moral language must
satisfy the requirement that like cases be judged
alike, but as long as appraisers judge (and act)
alike about their own cases, their prescriptions
about others count as moral ones. Further, since
Subjects of judgments can be expected to put
themselves in the positions (in turn) of all affected
parties, and since no one would prescribe that their
own interests (as expressed in their preferences)
be ignored, the only rational prescriptions are
those which take into account all interests on
an equal footing, or (in other words) utilitarian
ones. Thus Hare maintains that prescriptivism
generates preference utilitarianism.
While noncognitivists have increasingly been
recognizing rationality in moral discourse, other
philosophers have been reconstructing naturalism,
with its stress on objectivity and reason. While few
have supplied reductionist definitions of ethical
terms, many have maintained that naturalist
definitions cannot be known to be fallacious
beforehand, and that there is often a reasonable
route from naturalistic premises (about wants,
needs, or interests) to moral conclusions. Others
(such as Philippa Foot, 1978) have stressed that
acceptance of particular evaluations cannot be
construed as optional; there are certain virtues
which everyone needs, and the very concept

ethics

244
for their implausibly abstract and deracinated
concept of the self.
In stressing that humanity should never be
treated solely as a means, the Kantian approach
evokes widespread sympathy, despite the obscurity of the notion of treating humanity as an
end. This position gains strength by requiring
that individuals be given moral consideration as
opposed to inviolability; rule consequentialism,
however, can also require this. Its weakness lies
in its disregard for at least some of the avoidable
consequences of action; for in cogent accounts of
responsibility these consequences are included.
Consequentialism is at its most defensible
when it incorporates rules which enshrine and
ground rights and justice, and when premised
on a defensible value theory. The value theory of
utilitarianism is usually regarded as too narrow,
since not everything can turn on either the happiness of sentient creatures or the satisfaction of
preferences. For a plausible theory, other values
– suggestions include autonomy (Glover, 1977)
and the development of characteristic human
powers (Hurka, 1993) – must be included.
Equally, provision must be made for prioritizing
the satisfaction of basic needs, and for weighing
this plurality of values in some nonarbitrary
manner (Attfield, 1995).
Applied Ethics In recent decades philosophers
have rediscovered the applicability of ethical
reasoning to important public issues in areas
such as biomedical ethics, environmental ethics,
and the ethics of development, population, and
war. The application of ethics in these areas
was commonplace from earliest times to the
Enlightenment, but was marginalized as not the
proper concern of philosophy in the analytic
philosophy of the first six decades of the twentieth
century.
In environmental ethics, principles have been
elaborated for taking into account the well-being
of future generations and nonhuman species or
their members. Its debates promise to enhance
the adequacy of traditional theories concerning
the scope of moral standing, intrinsic value,
and obligation. Development ethics studies the
concept of development and issues surrounding
the related priorities, and promises to modify
received accounts of the good life. Population
ethics covers concepts such as overpopulation

and the relations of quantity and quality of
worthwhile life (see Parfit, 1984). The ethics of
war refines and appraises the Just War doctrine
of Aquinas, applying concepts such as proportionality to the unprecedented circumstances of
modern warfare. Thus some of the most penetrating work in ethical theory is to be found,
paradoxically, in practical applications of ethics
to the modern world.
Biomedical ethics exemplifies this further,
concerned as it is with the ethical problems arising in medicine and related disciplines. The field
is dominated by deontological theories on the one
hand – usually rights-based or Kantian – and
consequentialist theories on the other – usually
some form of utilitarianism. Thus the principle of
informed consent, based on a Kantian principle
of respect for autonomy or self-determination,
is taken to be central to the practice of medicine,
particularly in a clinical setting. At the same time
a widely debated approach to resource allocation
is based on maximizing quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs), and is to that extent an application of
utilitarianism.
However, although a few ethicists believe in a
“theory down” approach, whereby the philosopher
provides the moral theory, which is then strictly
applied to provide a final resolution of the problem in hand, most take a dialectical approach,
whereby the details of particular cases inform
the formulation of a moral framework, which may
be more or less complex but is by no means
definitive.
The attempts by some philosophers to provide
absolute rulings, conspicuously contrasting with
their apparent inability to do so satisfactorily,
have led some to a radical rejection of the role of
the philosopher in medical ethics. It has been
claimed that the philosopher has no distinctive
expertise that cannot be shared by the informed
layperson. However, it is clear that philosophy
does share some central concerns with medical
ethics. In attempting to determine the status of
the human fetus or the criteria of death, for
example, it is necessary to appeal to not only moral
theory, but also theories of personal identity and
the nature and status of the human mind.
Thus some who accept the criticisms leveled
against mainstream medical ethics have responded
not by rejecting the possibility of a specifically
philosophical contribution, but by searching for

245

Feminist Ethics Feminist ethics has been particularly active on this front. For example, the work
of moral psychologist Carol Gilligan (1993) has
inspired the development of an ethics of care.
Traditional moral theories – or at least those
which are currently most popular – are based on
formal, abstract reasoning; fundamental rules
are discovered and applied by an autonomous
moral agent who is able to abstract from the
particularities of a situation. Both deontological
and utilitarian theories fit this model. Gilligan,
however, claims to have discovered a “different
voice” in moral reasoning: women who conceive
of moral problems in such a way that “the moral
problem . . . requires for its resolution a mode of
thinking that is contextual and narrative rather
than formal and abstract” (p. 19). Thus, far from
moral decision-making demanding that certain
details of a situation, such as the relationships
between the individuals concerned, be disregarded
in order to reach a universal or impartial judgment, the ethics of care demands a responsiveness
to those details, in order that care is provided and
relationships are maintained.
Although much of the debate operates on a
theoretical level, drawing, for example, on feminist
epistemology and the claim that there is a masculine bias in traditional models of rationality, the
relevance of these insights for applied ethics,
and especially medical ethics, is clear. First, the
ethics of care begins with the moral agent as
situated within a particular, unique set of circumstances and is therefore embedded in practical
examples. Second, feminist ethicists, including
many of those not affiliated to the ethics of care,
share some of the central concerns of medical
ethicists. Most notable, perhaps, is the concern
with reproductive technology. Here feminists
have been particularly vocal in pointing to not
only the special interest that women have in the
debate and the different perspectives that they can
offer, but also to the fact that any discussion of
reproductive self-determination or reproductive
choice (in terms of which the debate is often
couched) must be contextualized to take in all
the relevant details of the positions from which
women make their choices.

While skepticism regarding the claims of mainstream moral theory has generated an interest in
contextual approaches such as the ethics of care,
some recent philosophers maintain that the postmodern rejection of the subject, and therewith
of the duality of subjects and objects, makes
many of the above issues outmoded, such as the
debate between objectivism and subjectivism,
and the problem of the status of intrinsic value
(Norton, 1991). Some of these theorists appeal to
the supposed interdependence of observers and
objects which they detect in the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum physics, and develop
in consequence an observer-dependent account
of value and thus of ethics. But standardly they
presuppose the very distinctions which they seek
to elide, and generate a form of radical skepticism
which forfeits the capacity to appraise injustice and
exploitation. Faced by such disastrous skepticism,
it is crucial that ethics retains the capacity to
supply countercritiques, and refuses to abandon
its perennially critical character.

some beginning to venture beyond it.

and compare themselves with contrasting,
neighboring societies; consequently, ethnicity is
fundamentally a political phenomenon based on
perceived differences between groups. Further,
ethnic difference is almost always critically
evaluated; one’s own variety is usually seen as
superior, an attitude termed ethnocentric.
Since the advent of empires in the fifteenth century, it has been increasingly likely that societies
will be incorporated into larger political entities.
Though assimilation into the Culture of the
dominant group has often occurred, it appears
much more frequent that groups are absorbed
politically but not culturally. The result is ethnic
groups occupying the position of a minority (or
majority) within a larger, multiethnic political
Structure. In these multiethnic states, egalitarianism is uncommon. Ethnocentrism and its
biological variant, Racism, are the rule; stable
power sharing is not.
Ethnic awareness focuses on the group’s
customs, conceptualized by social scientists as
culture. Anthropologists describe in comprehensive terms the breadth of a group’s culture, but
since ethnicity is self-awareness, how members
of a society define their distinctiveness will differ
from what the anthropologist describes. Indeed,
it may be politically expedient to exaggerate the
actual degree of distinctiveness, as in the tragic case
of Bosnia.
Factors which build ethnic solidarity include origin myths, oral tradition, pride in the achievements
of heroes, distinctive foods and dress, a separate
religious history, a strong identification with
a homeland, sacred sites and localities of past
events, artistic and musical styles, and language.
These factors may be conserved from the past,
embellished, or fabricated anew to support the
desire for group solidarity.
Ethnic pride, a common associate of ethnic
self-awareness, has risen sharply in recent years,
contributing powerfully to wars, massive population displacements, and separatist movements.
Meanwhile, enclave ethnic groups have since
the 1960s escalated their quest for home rule,
constitutional recognition as a group apart,
territorial demarcation, and often some form of
sovereignty.
The cultures of all peoples change, though
usually in ways that maintain an underlying cultural core. Thus Native Americans in the United

States choose leaders through balloting, use fax
machines to lobby Congress, and operate gambling casinos. Skeptics argue that they are thus
no longer owners of a distinctive tradition and
deserve no special consideration or recognition as
a group. These politically convenient attitudes
fail to accord to these societies the same option
to change that the skeptics would vigorously
demand for their own society, and also deny the
likelihood that such groups are preserving their
anchor values and ideas.
Ethnic distinctiveness appears to have been a
feature of our species since humans became cultural animals. Today, while borrowing cultural
ideas has never been easier or more widespread,
ethnicity seems certain to remain a fundamental
principle of contrast, divisiveness, and unity
among human communities.

`ethnomusicology 
At once a discipline, a
practice, and a scholarly approach to music, the
term “ethnomusicology” was first published by
Jaap Kunst in his Musicologica: A Study of the
Nature of Ethno-musicology, its Problems, Methods,
and Representative Personalities (1950). Conceived
as a revision of the field’s previous designation “comparative musicology” (“vergleichende
Musikwissenschaft”), the dividing hyphen in
Kunst’s subtitle was soon dropped from the
word in an ideological move to reflect important
distinctions between ethnomusicology and (historical) musicology.
While there is no single definition of ethnomusicology that has been universally accepted by
its practitioners, a brief review of several posited
characterizations provides both a limited survey
of shifting perspectives on the discipline over
time and a general overview of trends in the field.
Austrian musicologist Guido Adler declared that
comparative musicology “takes as its task the
comparing of tonal products, in particular the

How are communities’ musics affected as a
result of globalization, environmental changes,
developments in technology and mass media, or
political transformations?
An exploration of these questions reveals the
important relationship between ethnomusicology
and anthropology. While some indeed consider
ethnomusicology an outgrowth of social or
Cultural anthropology, others regard ethnomusicology as a branch of musicology, citing a
historical link between the fields and a common
interest in the scholarly study of music. While
most ethnomusicologists readily acknowledge
important influences that these and other fields,
methodologies, and bodies of theory have
exerted in the history of ethnomusicology, many
present-day practitioners assert and defend a distinct disciplinary identity – grounded in a body
of ethnomusicological theory and characterized
by particular approaches, methodologies, and
concepts. For many ethnomusicologists, the
distinction between ethnomusicology and (historical) musicology is a particularly important one,
as the former field opposes the Hegemony of the
Western European art music Canon and rejects
hierarchical constructions (“high art,” “great
works,” etc.) that often reside in musicological
studies.
Many of the disciplinary ancestors of modern
ethnomusicologists came to their musical studies
from the natural sciences, linguistics, mathematics, religion, or philosophy. The interest
in “exotic” and “primitive” musics that some
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century missionaries,
explorers, historians, and philosophers exhibited
appears in early publications like Jean Baptiste
Du Halde’s 4 volume study of China (1735),
Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Dictionnaire de Musique
(1768), and Sir William Jones’s “On the musical
modes of the Hindus” (1792). It was only during the last decades of the nineteenth century,
though, that folklorists, musicians, scientists, and
ethnologists in North America, Great Britain,
and Western and Eastern Europe began systematically collecting, recording, and transcribing
melodies and songs. These scholars began to
take seriously the task of writing about the
musical traditions they encountered, with some
of the first studies growing out of interests
in acoustics, music perception, linguistics, and
scientific principles.

ethnomusicology

(1885, trans. Mugglestone, 1981). This assertion
has been echoed for over a century in common
descriptions, with scholars identifying the field as
“the study of exotic music” (Apel, 1945), “the comparative study of musics of the world” (Nettl,
1986), and “an approach to the study of any
music” (Hood, 1969). Ethnomusicology has also
been characterized as “the study of non-Western
and folk music” (Nettl, 1983), “the anthropological study of music” (Merriam, 1964), “the
study of music as a universal aspect of human
behavior” (Nketia, 1962), “the study of the different musical systems of the world” (Blacking,
1973), “the study of people making music”
(Titon, 1992), or “the study of music in culture”
(Merriam, 1960), a description that Merriam
later revised to “the study of music as culture”
(1973).
While it is clear that articulating a precise
definition for ethnomusicology is difficult, a set
of generally accepted fundamental principles
and approaches underlies the work of most
present-day ethnomusicologists. Chief among
these are a commitment to the maintenance of a
relativistic view of musics and musical practices,
a devotion to the model of music and Culture
as inextricably linked, and the adoption of a particular research methodology. This methodology
typically includes some balance of ethnographic
fieldwork and archival, library-, or documentbased research, and musical participation or
interaction commonly occupies an important
place in a scholar’s work. Finally, ethnomusicologists share a common understanding that
certain musical universals are identifiable and
meaningful, but generally eschew the popular
claim that “music is a universal language” and
argue, instead, for specialized attention to each
music on its own terms (Nettl, 1983).
Ethnomusicologists explore a wide range of
topics, but the kinds of questions they ask are
generally centered in a particular framework that
provides fundamental conceptual grounding. How
do human processes (biological, social, cognitive, etc.) operate in music making and interaction? What is the relationship between music
and identity? What links exist between human
characteristics (Gender, sexuality, Ethnicity,
race, kinship, etc.) and music? To what extent does
music relate to other kinds of human expression,
like dance, Theater, literature, and Ritual?

ethnomusicology

248
Comparative musicologists of late nineteenthand early twentieth-century Europe and North
America typically viewed “primitive” and “exotic”
musics as occupying earlier musical phases
in development that would eventually lead to
Western European art music, and focused their
efforts primarily on musical preservation through
song collection and transcription. Gathering folk
songs throughout (especially Eastern) Europe
occupied early European researchers, whose work
also extended into parts of Asia, the Middle East,
and Africa. Two accomplishments in the latter
part of the nineteenth century are still regarded
as invaluable for their impact on comparative
musicology then, and today’s ethnomusicology.
The first of these, Thomas Edison’s invention
of the phonograph in 1877, represents perhaps
the most important technological development
in the history of the discipline. The phonograph
provided early comparative musicologists, who
engaged in musical studies primarily to document and preserve the musical traditions they
encountered, with a revolutionary way to capture musical sounds. The instrument was first
used in the “field” by Jesse Walter Fewkes, an
American zoologist, archeologist, and ethnologist,
whose 1890 recordings of the Passamaquoddy
Indians of Maine are believed to be the first
recordings made of American Indians. Before
the device’s invention, transcription was a grueling task: relying on a single performer’s repeated
iterations of one melody or song often resulted
in variances in each subsequent performance.
Edison’s invention transformed the process
of musical analysis and transcription, allowing
researchers to repeatedly play back previously
recorded musical examples. Further, the physical
recording captured distinct musical features –
timbral (“tone color”) characteristics, pitch variations, aspects of musical interpretation and
accent – that are ineffectively conveyed with
mere description. When played back, even the
earliest cylinders transmitted more information to
a listener than any written interpretation could
provide to a reader. Technology continues to
play an important role in ethnomusicological
research, and while today’s devices have developed
far beyond Edison’s first concept, his innovation
gave early scholars a tool for preservation and
facilitated modern advances in technology and
media.

Published eight years after Edison’s invention,
British scientist and philologist Alexander J.
Ellis’s “On the musical scales of various nations”
(1885) developed earlier research in acoustics
and mathematics, proposed an important system for pitch organization, and posited thenrevolutionary ideas about the concept of pitch.
His study represents an important contribution
to ethnomusicology in part because it contains a
systematic, detailed analysis of pitch organization,
marking it as the first published broadly comparative survey of individual scales. His publication is more important, though, for both the
“cents system” he articulates in its pages and
his resultant upending of typical value-laden
declarations on pitch organization. In the body
of this pioneering essay, he carried out extensive
analysis of various scales from Asia, Europe, and
Africa using his newly developed cents system. This
precise method for measuring and referencing
pitch assumed the model of a fortepiano tuned
in the Western European equal tempered system.
Ellis took the instrument’s smallest interval, the
semitone, and imagined a further division of 100
equal units per half step, terming these minute
intervals “cents.” By dividing the semitone (and,
thus, the octave) into such small, arbitrary units,
Ellis’s analysis could approach each scale as
an independent unit, on its own terms, with an
unprecedented degree of accuracy. Based on
his findings, Ellis concludes: “that the Musical
Scale is not one, not ‘natural,’ not even founded
necessarily on the laws of the constitution of
musical sound, . . . but very diverse, very artificial,
and very capricious” (1885: 527). This revolutionary conclusion revealed the ethnocentrism
of the era’s conventional approaches to musical
analysis and suggested that different musics
require different modes of analysis. Recognizing
the system’s value as a standardized method for
discussing pitch in extremely precise, relativistic
terms, ethnomusicologists still commonly employ
the cents system to reference tuning systems and
pitch structures.
Ellis’s work on music perception influenced
German psychologist and musicologist Carl
Stumpf, whose 1886 publication “Leider der
Bellakula Indianer” is often cited as the beginning
of ethnomusicology in Germany for its status
as the first work to give substantial, detailed
attention to a single tribe’s musical culture. Best

249
During the same period, North American
researchers focused their attention primarily on
communities of American Indians living in the
United States and parts of Canada. A group of
scholars, anthropologists, and private citizens,
including William Wells Newell and Mark
Twain, had founded The American Folklore
Society in 1888. The society immediately began
publishing a corresponding periodical, the Journal of American Folklore, which remains in
print to the present day. Alice Cunningham
Fletcher, already an established ethnographer of
(primarily Omaha) Indian music and culture,
was named president of the society in 1905,
becoming the first woman to hold the position.
Fletcher’s pioneering work, including Indian Story
and Song (1900), the collaborative The Omaha
Tribe (1911, with Frances La Flesche), and “The
study of Indian music” (1915), is remembered
today as the beginning of ethnomusicology in
America. Directly influenced by Fletcher’s work,
ethnologist Frances Densmore stands out in the
discipline’s history for her efforts to document,
preserve, and champion American Indian music.
She recorded thousands of American Indian
melodies, beginning as early as 1904, including
the 2,400 that she transcribed in the course of her
personal research and 50 years of work at the
Bureau of American Ethnology (Smithsonian
Institution). Committed to reversing popular
misunderstandings of American Indian music,
Densmore published more than 20 studies of
musical practice in individual tribes before her
death in 1957.
In some important cases, anthropologists
were teaching students of comparative musicology at leading universities in the United States.
Among others, anthropologist Franz Boas stood
on opposite methodological ground from the
Berlin school’s scientific analyses, and thus
urged his students to adopt an ethnographic
approach in their research. Boas trained one of
Hornbostel’s former students, George Herzog,
to apply fieldwork methods from anthropology to
his studies of music. The combined influence
from his training in Germany and at Columbia
led Herzog to blend analytical techniques and
theoretical perspectives in his work. Active early
in the development of the American Musicological Society, Herzog participated in the society’s
early meetings alongside fellow Boas disciple

ethnomusicology

known to music scholars as a pioneer in comparative musicology, Stumpf founded the Berliner
Phonogramm-Archiv in 1900, the world’s first
significant archive of field recordings, which
represents a symbolic moment in ethnomusicological history. Stumpf ’s students include other
important pioneers in comparative musicology,
including Austrian scholar Erich von Hornbostel
and German scholar Robert Lachmann. It was
Hornbostel who became Stumpf ’s assistant at
the Phonogramm-Archiv and, in 1904, formally
outlined a concept for the field of comparative musicology, effectively establishing what is
now known as the field’s own “Berlin school.”
Hornbostel traveled to North America two years
later to research music among the Pawnee Indians
and, in the same year, was named PhonogrammArchiv’s director, a position he held for over
25 years. In 1914, Hornbostel and another of
Stumpf ’s students, German-born musicologist
and organologist Curt Sachs, published the
Hornbostel–Sachs system, a (still) widely used
classification system for musical instruments.
Beyond Germany, folklorists and comparative
musicologists in North America, Great Britain, and
other parts of Europe were also active around the
turn of the twentieth century. By 1903, British folklorist Cecil Sharp had begun collecting English
dances and folksongs, which he compiled and
first published in 1907, just four years before
he founded the English Folk Dance Society.
Australian-born Percy Grainger also began collecting in Britain at the start of the century, and
his production of the first commercial recordings
of folksong marks an important development in
the field.
Also important in Europe at this time is
Hungarian composer, scholar, and pianist Béla
Bartók, whose studies of Eastern European
folk music in the first decade of the twentieth
century introduced the practice of ethnographic
fieldwork in comparative musicology. Inspired
by a folksong he heard in 1904, Bartók began
researching and collecting folksongs in 1906
with fellow Hungarian composer, scholar, and
philosopher Zoltán Kodály. Bartók produced
several manuscripts about Romanian, Hungarian,
and Turkish folksongs, an interest that informed
many of his own compositions: themes, melodies,
and characteristics from the music he researched
and transcribed surface throughout his oeuvre.

ethnomusicology

Helen Heffron Roberts, Charles Seeger, another
important musicologist of the period, and others.
Representing some of the first formal intersections
of music and anthropology, Seeger and Herzog
began to formulate concepts concerning the
relationship of song styles to aspects of culture.
While the focus of pre-Second World War
ethnomusicology remained on the preservation
of music though field research, written documentation, recording, and musical transcription,
an influx of scholars (including Curt Sachs and
Erich von Hornbostel) fleeing anti-Semitic policies in Europe impacted comparative musicology
on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In the
United States, American scholars also began
turning more seriously to musical communities
that had not previously received a great deal of
attention. In this area, the work of American
folklorist John Lomax and his youngest son Alan
is invaluable. As early as the first decade of the
twentieth century, the elder Lomax had struggled
to gain an audience for his work on American
cowboy songs. It was only after formalizing a
relationship with the Library of Congress in
1933 that the father and son duo set out on their
official song-collecting expeditions, visiting prisons, mountain communities, and farms, where
they encountered and recorded countless musicians including, famously, Huddie (“Leadbelly”)
Ledbetter. The younger Lomax went on to
develop some of Seeger and Herzog’s earlier
concepts and proposed the analytical method
known as cantometrics, a system of relating
vocal characteristics and singing style to dominant
social values and structures. While this method
has been thoroughly critiqued, its importance
today rests partly in the method’s successful
refocusing of musical inquiry back on performance (Averill, 2003).
Key changes in the discipline began around
1950, with a dramatic increase in the number
of formal programs in ethnomusicology in the
United States and Europe, an upsurge in publications of book-length studies of individual
societies and musical cultures, and the establishment of professional societies devoted to
ethnomusicology (notably the Society for
Ethnomusicology in 1955 and the International
Folk Music Council, now the International
Council for Traditional Music, in 1948). In a
major shift, scholarly interest began to move

from so-called tribal and folk traditions to
the “high art” and “classical” music of Asia.
Learning to perform the music that one
researched became an important component of
fieldwork in this period, as personal experience
with music became a central concern for many
ethnomusicologists. Mantle Hood proposed a
model of “bi-musicality”, whereby a scholarmusician becomes as well trained in a second
musical tradition (usually related to the area of
research) as in a first (usually related to upbringing). As part of his landmark effort at UCLA, Hood
pulled together a group of distinguished musicians
from around the world to teach a variety of
musical ensembles in America, facilitating his
direct musical engagement for his students.
The influence of cultural anthropology rose,
too, around this time, with anthropologists Alan
Merriam, John Blacking, and David McAllester
offering significant contributions to the renamed
field of “ethno-musicology” (Kunst, 1950), “the
study of music in culture” (Merriam, 1960).
Calling for the discipline’s adoption of an
anthropological approach, Merriam (1964) proposed his foundational tripartite model for
musical analysis. This model declares that culturally
defined values, human behaviors, and musical
sound exist in an interdependent relationship, and
suggests the adoption of the model for ethnomusicological inquiry. Merriam’s book takes
its place among several other important works
that, published around the same time, articulate
the foundations of ethnomusicological theory,
approach, and methodology (Kunst, 1959; Sachs
and Kunst, 1961; Nettl, 1964; Hood, 1971).
While segments of some of these texts are now
outdated, in substance they form a solid body of
work to ideologically orient the ethnomusicologist.
Even since the formal adoption of the term
“ethnomusicology,” scholars have continued to
propose revisions to the name, including the
famous suggestions “the anthropology of music”
(Merriam, 1964), “cultural musicology” (Chase,
1972), and “comparative sociomusicology” (Feld,
1984). The course of these changes reflects a
still-present concern shared by many ethnomusicologists about the potentially problematic
implications of the discipline’s name – as recently
as March 2009, lengthy discussion about the
appropriateness of the word “ethnomusicology”
occupied members of the United States-based

251
ethnomusicological approach to the study of
Western European art music. As the field has
gradually come to regard its methodology as
its defining characteristic, rigid boundaries that
defined acceptable objects of ethnomusicological study (and relegated others, like popular
musics and jazz, to the outskirts) have dissolved.
The ethnomusicology of the twenty-first century willingly examines the global dissemination
of popular musics, music and the agendas of
Multiculturalism, constructs of identity in
diasporic communities, and the use of music as
torture. It is common for today’s student to
identify equally and simultaneously with both
a music department and another academic program. Whether this relationship engages studies
of Gender and sexuality, Film studies, area
studies, or Women’s studies, contemporary
ethnomusicology concerns itself as much with
issues and ideas as with particular sounds and
formal structures.

`ethnophilosophy 
Ethnophilosophy designates
a practice alongside the discipline of African
philosophy, but one which has earned the strong
disapproval of authoritative figures among
African philosophers. The designation indicates
its critics’ perceptions that ethnophilosophy,

ethnophilosophy

Society for Ethnomusicology discussion list. The
discipline has been criticized, from within and
without, for its fixation on defining its identity and
its tendency towards constant self-revision.
The sociopolitical climate of the 1960s
impelled some of the newly renamed field’s
scholars to advocacy. With the converging issues
of civil rights, feminism, and the conflict in
Vietnam, the social agenda and self-consciousness
of ethnomusicology expanded. During the last
quarter of the twentieth century, ethnomusicological methodology became increasingly
shaped by Critical theory, Cultural studies,
Hermeneutics, Semiotics, and linguistics.
Moving away from the purely analytical and
descriptive studies that characterized work in
the earlier part of the century, ethnomusicological scholarship turned to interpretive studies
and ethnographies, reflecting a trend toward
strengthened interdisciplinarity.
For much of the twentieth century, most
ethnomusicologists focused on the music of
“other” cultures, not usually considering Western
European art music traditions or popular musics
in their research. Because many ethnomusicologists still study music making outside of their own
cultural contexts, many of the field’s scholars
contend with ethical complexities implicit in
fieldwork-based interaction and research. The
“self/Other” dichotomy, for example, the legacy
of colonialism, the danger of cultural imperialism,
the influence one exerts on cultural systems one
encounters, the weight of one’s own cultural
perspective, and the bearing of this perspective on
one’s scholarship are common issues. Innovative
technologies also spawn new concerns for the
researcher, as developments in recording and
mass media continue to shape the way ethnomusicologists carry out research. Many scholars
also reckon with inherent power imbalances in
research relationships and the “problem” of
privilege (economic, educational, or otherwise) that
they carry with them to the field. Increasingly
as the twentieth century progressed, however,
international scholars gained a more prominent
voice in the discipline as their authoritative
“insider” studies provided long-awaited new
perspectives for ethnomusicology.
It has also become more common for ethnomusicologists to engage with musical practices in
the Americas and Western Europe, or to take an

ethnophilosophy

252
which its practitioners represent as legitimate
philosophy, blurs the distinctions between true
philosophy and ethnography, and that it is in
fact ethnology with philosophical pretensions.
The typical and seminal ethnophilosophical
text is Placide Tempels’s La Philosophie bantou
(1945), translated into English as Bantu Philosophy (1969), in which the author undertook to
demonstrate the existence of a Bantu ontological
system and a Bantu philosophy which had hitherto not been synthesized or systematized in any
explicit fashion. Tempels, a Belgian Catholic
missionary priest who worked for many years
in the Congo, believed that by virtue of being
human, the Bantu, like all human societies, had
a philosophy, and also that, even though they
might be unaware of their ontology or their philosophy, and consequently might be unable to
articulate it, they none the less lived intuitively
by it. He believed furthermore that an outsider
trained in such matters could accurately synthesize the ontology by studying the thoughts, beliefs,
and practices of the people. Following Tempels’s
lead, some African scholars undertook to distill
other examples of African philosophy from
ethnological data. Alexis Kagame in La Philosophie bantu–rwandaise de l’être (Bantu–Rwandan
Philosophy of Being, 1956) and La Philosophie
bantu comparée (Comparative Bantu Philosophy,
1976), unveiled what he described as a collective
system of thought among the Bantu, a system
that was profound and implicit, one lived rather
than deliberated upon, and which, being unanimist, was also superior to systems ascribable
to individual thinkers, such as characterized the
West. He claimed further that this philosophy,
though implicit and collective, was nevertheless
amenable to Aristotelian analysis. In anglophone
Africa the figure most associated with ethnophilosophy is John Mbiti, author of African Religions and
Philosophy (1969).
The objections to ethnophilosophy come
from African philosophers who are products
of European universities and are consequently
steeped in the Western tradition of philosophy.
Sometimes referred to as academic philosophers
because of their customary affiliation with the
philosophy departments of African universities,
they are predominantly from francophone Africa,
and leftist in their ideological orientation. They
take issue, for example, with, among other

aspects of the practice, precisely the one Kagame
cites as its claim to superiority over Western
philosophies – its unanimism. In the view of
the academic philosophers, chief among whom
is the Beninois Paulin Hountondji, the very
suggestion of unanimism (attested to by such
formulations as “bantu philosophy,” “African
philosophy,” “La Philosophie bantou–rwandaise,”
and so forth) is contrary to the nature of true
philosophy. Philosophy, for them, is an individual
activity, an individual’s intellectual engagement
with experience. Far from being unanimist,
therefore, it is pluralistic, and, in the words of
Paulin Hountondji, the chief campaigner against
ethnophilosophy, characterized by an “irreducible polysemy of discourse” (Hountondji,
1983, p. 179). Also, inasmuch as they regard
philosophy as a conscious and rigorous intellectual activity, the opponents of ethnophilosophy
reject the notion of an implicit philosophy,
one lived by adherents who remain unaware of
its existence. Also unacceptable to them is the
ethnophilosophers’ methodology, which seems
to accord equal value to all members of a society
as reliable informants on ethnological matters.
Other prominent anti-ethnophilosophers are
Stanislaus Adotevi and Marcien Towa.
Rejecting Tempels’s contention that all human
beings possess a philosophy, these academic
philosophers argue that philosophy is a science
preoccupied with analyses of written Texts.
Science cannot exist without Writing, and since
traditional African societies were illiterate, and
therefore ignorant of science, they could not
have had philosophy. They deflect Tempels’s
charge that denial of philosophy to any group of
humans is tantamount to denying its humanity
by conceding that African thinkers of the past must
have reflected on the issues that are central to
Western philosophy, in other words, that they
must have philosophized; but they insist that,
since we have no record of their reflections or their
findings, we do not have their philosophy or any
evidence of it. Hence the intriguing concept of
philosophers without philosophy.
Although the debate about ethnophilosophy
is primarily a contest concerning the integrity
of philosophy as a discipline, its critics are also
animated by a preoccupation with progress.
They perceive ethnophilosophy and its claims as
both symbolizing and valorizing the features of

`European cultural studies in Western Europe 
The phrase “Cultural studies” –
used in the original English – has become current among scholars in university departments of
English in Western continental Europe. It joins
other terms with longer histories: the French
civilisation and the German Landeskunde, and
in Scandinavia the English civilization. Through
the French and German terms there are links
with scholarship in other languages and other university departments with their own traditions
and interpretations of what shall be the context
for the teaching of a foreign language at higher
and, by extension, secondary education levels. It
is a particular characteristic of cultural studies
in these situations that it is inseparable, at least
with respect to teaching if not research, from the
issues of language learning and the fact that
most students will become schoolteachers. Despite
the advanced levels of language mastery of
many students in higher education in mainland
Europe – particularly in English – the fact that the
language and Culture are foreign is significant
for the development of cultural studies. This
then also means that in methods of teaching and
researching, cultural studies includes comparison
with and reflection on the culture and cultural
identities of the learners and the society in which
they live.
The German term Landeskunde has a complex
history, reflecting a high degree of pedagogical
interest in relating language to contexts other
than literary, and also encapsulating the relationship of foreign language learning in higher and
secondary education to historical events. In the
1920s and 1930s Kulturkunde, as part of the
teaching of English, was a means of encouraging
the appreciation of German culture by contrasting it with that of English-speaking countries.
This approach then facilitated the process of
Gleichschaltung in 1935 of foreign language
teaching in Nazi Germany. After the defeat of
Nazism, the first response in West Germany
was to attempt to make Landeskunde valuefree by emphasizing its subordination to the
aim of acquiring the skills of communication.

European cultural studies in Western Europe

traditional African thought and habits that were
responsible for the misfortunes the continent
and its people had experienced, from enslavement through colonization and eventual (or
consequent) underdevelopment. For example,
the Ghanaian Kwasi Wiredu points out that
unanimism and implicitness reflect the authoritarianism of the traditional system, which requires
people to live by timeless Codes established by
remote ancestors, and the youth to defer unconditionally to the old who are held to be incontrovertible custodians of wisdom. The resulting
stifling of initiative, he argues, militates against
initiative and the development of the mind.
Some of the academic philosophers, while
accepting the need to clearly distinguish ethnology from philosophy, are uneasy about the
insistence by Hountondji and his colleagues that
no philosophy is uncompromisingly a science,
and that the Western practice is normative. They
also balk at the suggestion (by Towa especially)
that Africa’s future lies in Africans assimilating the
spirit of Europe. In something of a compromise
between the forces of philosophy and ethnophilosophy, H. Odera Oruka proposes what he
describes as “sage philosophy,” defined as “the
expressed thoughts of wise men and women in
any given community,” which can be in writing,
saying, or arguments (1990, p. 51). He recognizes
the thoughts of Ogotemmeli as expressed to
Marcel Griaule as an example. Another example
would be the thoughts of Yoruba sages which Barry
Hallen and J.O. Sodipo discuss in Knowledge,
Belief and Witchcraft: Analytic Experiments in
African Philosophy (1986).

European cultural studies in Western Europe

Landeskunde should provide the necessary information to facilitate communication and a positive – and often false – image of “Merry Old
England” as a means of creating enthusiasm,
motivation, and a readiness for contact among
learners. In the case of American studies, the
development was influenced by notions of reeducation and democracy, and the study of politics
and contemporary history was introduced earlier
than in English studies. A parallel development
to include contemporary politics and history
also took place in departments of Romance
studies, more familiar with the concept civilisation (see below). None the less, at university level
Landeskunde remained the marginal province of
nonprofessorial teachers and researchers, with
traditional literature studies dominating the high
ground. In the German Democratic Republic,
the dominance of Marxist–Leninist theory provided a critique of Kulturkunde up to 1945 and a
basis for “a systematic, transferable knowledge of
the foreign culture(s) . . . but these suggestions
were, at least in part, impaired by the fact that they
presented one instead of a variety of competing
views of the foreign culture(s) under discussion”
(Kramer, 1994, p. 28).
Dissatisfaction with the attempt to replace
Kulturkunde with a neutral Landeskunde led in
West Germany, in the 1980s, to the introduction
of the work of Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall,
and the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary
Cultural Studies. Dieter Buttjes (1981) and
Jürgen Kramer (1983) were particularly influential in making cultural studies accessible to a
wider audience and the eventual instigation in
1990 of an annual meeting on cultural studies
– using the English term – outside the existing
institutional structures which were still resistant
to challenges to traditional forms of literature
teaching. Coincidence with the unification of
Germany ensured the participation of researchers
from the former GDR – the second conference
being held in Jena – and a broader methodological and content focus than cultural studies in the
British tradition.
The French term civilisation has a much longer
and more general history than Landeskunde, and,
rather than referring to a discipline associated
with language teaching, designates the “object” of
study itself. Within the academy, however, the
term is used to refer to an area of teaching and

research, l’étude de la civilisation, which is “a pretty
close equivalent to what comes to be known in
Britain and elsewhere as ‘cultural studies’, provided the term ‘cultural’ is taken to mean the
mechanism, practice and institutions through
which the world is interpreted, meanings are
conveyed, internalised in people’s minds and
recycled . . . a quest for a total interpretation”
(Révauger, 1993a, p. 26). Civilisation shares
with Landeskunde a hitherto marginal role in
university English departments in France and a
consequent desire on the part of some proponents
to define the area of study in terms of a discipline,
while acknowledging the advantages of standing
at the crossroads of pluridisciplinarity, where
innovations are more likely to take place.
Links are none the less made with existing
disciplines within English departments, and with
broader traditions in French education, through
the methodology of textual commentary or
documentary analysis and the concept of explication de texte. This detailed practical skill of
explaining Text and its relationship to context also
requires knowledge of a culture or civilisation, and
is not unlike the detailed analysis of texts within
their broad sociohistorical context practiced in
some versions of cultural studies.
Though the English term “civilization” is perhaps avoided in British and American institutions
because of its “complicated and much disputed
relation with the modern social sense of culture” (Williams, 1983, p. 59), it is not entirely
shunned in Scandinavian departments of English. In Norway, the deliberate introduction of
civilization was part of the familiar problem of
establishing a teaching and research base, and
credibility as a discipline (Oakland, 1993, p. 34).
Disciplinary bases hitherto included sociology,
history, and political science, as well as the
methods of textual analysis.
Common to the situations discussed so far is
the problem of establishing an institutional base
against the resistance of other areas of study,
particularly literary studies. Protagonists in the
debate seem to be undecided whether they should
take their strength from pluridisciplinarity or
establish a clearly demarcated new discipline.
Though the former promises innovation, the
latter is more acceptable to institutions. Furthermore, although some proponents of cultural
studies are specialists in American studies, many

255
effects are not only a better understanding
of the geopolitical relationships between countries (Sevaldsen, 1993) and the images of other
cultures in our own society, but also a reflexive
understanding of one’s own culture and cultural
identities. This helps not only the definition
of self – at national, regional, and individual
levels – but also serves others in their selfunderstanding through critical analysis from
an outsider perspective.
The practical significance of this juxtaposition
of interpretations of others and self becomes
evident for students in their contacts with
members of the culture and society in question.
This is, however, not merely the provision in
Landeskunde of the background information
necessary in intercultural meetings. As social
actors engaged with other cultural identities, their
own identities are inseparable from interaction and
communication, as is their critical awareness
of the relationship between self and otherness.
It is in the verbal and nonverbal, the explicit
and implicit meanings exchanged through the
foreign language, that students practice their
cultural studies.
Yet there is little recognition of the needs of
students of cultural studies as language learners,
whose grasp of the language and culture will
inevitably remain incomplete and different in
kind from that of a native speaker. The pedagogy
and learning theory of cultural studies for foreign
language learners is not considered or, at best, is
imported inappropriately from cultural studies
for native speakers. Furthermore, some of these
language-and-culture learners will themselves
become teachers of a foreign language-andculture and, in the French and German traditions
at least, the issues of Landeskunde and civilisation in higher education cannot be divorced
from teaching in secondary education, usually
at more elementary levels of language learning
where issues of pedagogy cannot be so easily
ignored. It is not surprising, therefore, that in
Germany in particular, the development of theory of Landeskunde and cultural studies has been
prosecuted by Didaktiker, university teachers
and researchers responsible for the training in
methods of teaching of future secondary school
teachers.
A rare exception is offered by Campos et al. who
discuss the relationship between school-level

European cultural studies in Western Europe

focus their research on Britain, and a further
factor in institutional struggles is the introduction of the concept of British studies and, in
Germany, a Journal for the Study of British Cultures,
which will no doubt support the professionalization of specialists on Britain.
A similar kind of support for teachers and
researchers in the civilisation of France is offered
by a survey of the teaching of civilisation in the
French departments of European universities
(Campos et al., 1988). Here we find the by now
familiar debates about the scope and nature of the
subject, together with detailed accounts of the
courses offered and discussion of institutional
and professional problems similar to those of
English departments. If we accept the general
comparability of cultural studies, Landeskunde,
and civilisation, it is clear there are many people
concerned, in many kinds of foreign language
departments, including those in Britain. It is,
however, also evident from this survey that
civilisation remains “the poor relation” to study
of language and literature, lacking space in the curriculum, status in the eyes of most professional
staff, and an explicit theoretical and disciplinary
base (Campos et al., 1988, p. 103).
The fact that cultural studies as part of foreign
language teaching introduces students to a society and culture other than their own has several
significant dimensions. First, on a geopolitical
level, the relationships between the countries
studied need to be acknowledged as part of the
teaching and research. The provision of material
and financial support for the study of its culture
by country A in the universities and schools of
country B is doubtless part of its political agenda.
The critical study of country C by researchers in
country D who are also teachers of future mediators between the two countries – economists,
business people, teachers, politicians – has
undefined but real influences on international
relationships.
Such geopolitical considerations should lead
to a comparative methodology in teaching and
research, the significance of which is only beginning to be recognized among the many other
debates about the nature of cultural studies
and institutionalization. Where the students are
from several countries, comparative methods
become inevitable (Husemann, 1994), but are
no less important in homogeneous classes. The

exchange

256
and university-level teaching of civilisation in
terms of three levels of learning. They argue
(1988, p. 122) that whereas at an elementary
level learners need information about the meanings of words, at intermediate and advanced
levels the teaching of civilisation can be separate
from language teaching. Furthermore, it is only
at university level that a critical dimension is
appropriate. Such a view does not, however,
adequately recognize the complexity of language
learning, the interrelationships of acquisition
of linguistic skill and knowledge with affective as
well as cognitive development in experience of
another culture – in the classroom and more
particularly in a foreign country – at all levels of
learning. This kind of argument betrays the lack
of an adequate learning theory for all levels, the
absence of a pedagogy of comparative methods,
and, in particular, the need to develop a pedagogy
of experiential learning for students at all levels
who in increasing numbers spend substantial
periods of residence and learning in another
country. These are the glaring needs of cultural
studies in continental Europe and beyond, when
cultural studies is taught and researched in contexts of foreign language learning.

`exchange 
In combination with reciprocity,
the essence of all social interaction. Following
Polanyi, exchange is of three types: reciprocal

(for example, gift giving), redistributive (tax and
expend), and market (barter and sales). Social
relationships are at issue with the first, authority
with the second, and, mainly, the distribution of
goods with the third.

`existentialism 
A philosophical position associated with two main theses: first, that humans
have a special sort of existence that always points
beyond itself and which cannot be assimilated
to the mode of existence of nonhuman things;
second, that it is possible to overcome the error
of conceiving of ourselves as fundamentally
alienated or estranged from the world by revealing the dependence of a significant world upon
human meaning-bestowing practices.
Such a characterization of existentialism is not
uncontentious, especially when compared with
the received popular view. Existentialism is often
popularly portrayed as advocating a form of
nihilism and a consequent flight into irrationality: the world as a whole is without meaning or
value and actions are groundless and arbitrary; the
lack of any necessity for the existence or order
of the world leads to a sense of despair and Angst
in the face of actions and a life that is free but, if
we are honest, seen as irredeemably and utterly
groundless and futile; the individual can at best
act only in response to his “true self,” knowing
no external standards exist against which to
check his values.
That such a view of existentialism is mistaken
can be gleaned from an examination of the two
most important existentialists, Heidegger and
Sartre. That the misconception has arisen is
traceable partly to the inclusion of just about
anyone from the history of human thought who
has emphasized our Alienation from a world
that seems to provide no justification for, and is
unresponsive to, any System of values, often
with the added complication of the “death of
God” as external arbiter and law giver. Such a view
is found in the writing of Albert Camus. There is
also a confusion between existentialism as a systematic philosophical position and existentialism
as a historical movement associated with its

257
human actions and projects, encountered as an
“obstacle,” that a world of significance appears
at all. In this sense there is no question of one’s
being alienated from the world, for we have
recaptured the primacy of a world that is suffused with human values, that is, the concrete
everyday world essential to human survival and
action, which is not one made flat by neutral
disinterest, but one highlighted and given shape
by human concerns. It must be emphasized that
such a human world, one of significances-forhuman-beings, is not inferior to the world of
scientific or metaphysical speculation, or one
that is merely “subjective,” to be transcended by
a truer “objective” view, for such a disinterested
view, if possible at all, is in fact parasitic upon
the world arising from our being-in-the-world: the
world as it is for human beings. The whole tendency of existentialism is to erase the subjective–
objective dichotomy, since the basis for its
articulation is misconceived.
The distinctive mode of human existence is in
Sartre’s phrase that it is what it is not, and is
not what it is. Consciousness, being-for-itself,
stands out from the mode of existence of things,
being-in-itself. Unlike a nonhuman thing which
simply is, human conscious existence has no
predetermined essence fixing its nature; rather, it
makes itself in its acts and is constantly becoming, pointing beyond itself to future projects.
Human existence is characterized by the process
of becoming, and only by including in its
description what it is not yet can a description be
adequate. Indeed, only in death can some kind
of assessment of what kind of person one was be
legitimately made. The interdependence of the
existence of consciousness (as not-a-thing which
emerges only in its separation from the nonconscious object of its conscious act) and the
existence of the world (which is intelligibly
referred to, has significance and meaning, only as
an object for consciousness) dissolves the mind–
body dualism that leads to the problem of the
knowledge of the existence of the external world
and our alienation from it. In the same way our
knowledge of other minds is grounded in some
aspects of our self-awareness which presuppose
that we view ourselves as an object for others.
Existentialism emphasizes our freedom by arguing that in the human mode of being existence
precedes essence. We first are, then become what

existentialism

hangers-on who adopted the term to justify, in
the apparent absence of anything but gratuitous
and arbitrary guides to action, an egoistical,
nihilistic, and sometimes hedonistic lifestyle
tending towards self-destruction.
Apart from those already mentioned, important thinkers for the understanding of existentialism are Kierkegaard, Jaspers, Merleau-Ponty,
Ortega y Gasset, and Simone de Beauvoir.
More controversially, Nietzsche is sometimes
added to this list.
Far from embracing our supposed alienation
from the world, existentialism seeks to overcome
it. It does so by rejecting the fruit of Cartesian
philosophy which in one sense culminates in the
Phenomenology of Husserl. While existentialism
accepts Husserl’s view that the distinctive nature
of human consciousness is its intentionality
– that in any conscious act there is always a
pointing to an object of attention – it rejects the
Cartesian-inspired project of a significant world
emerging from a process whereby all the contingencies of the human perspective are stripped
from our conception of the world to reveal it as
it is in itself: a view from nowhere. It is the world
thus characterized, supposedly the true objective
view of it, which is revealed by the nonperspectival disinterested standpoint of the detached ego
or soul, that inevitably leads to a fundamental
rift with and our alienation from the world.
The first step in undermining this view comes
from making phenomenology existential, holding
that not only is all consciousness intentional,
but that also it must in its conscious acts point
to something that is not-consciousness. This
undercuts the idealism latent in Husserl’s pure
phenomenology. Existentialism attempts to overcome world alienation by arguing for the logical
primacy of the world significances that arise
from our concrete encounter with the world as
actors with distinctively human needs and purposes. Without such concrete being-in-the-world
in a manner distinctive of human conscious
existence (see Heidegger’s term Dasein) – as
opposed to as a detached transcendental ego – no
world of any significance would emerge at all,
and without such significances there is no mechanism for referring to the world. There can be
no a priori apprehension of pure meanings. We
are beings “thrown” in the world, and it is only
in grappling or dealing with it as a problem in

existentialism

258
we are. Existentialism argues thus not to support
the view that human action must be arbitrary,
capricious, and irrational, based perhaps on
gut instincts or an adherence to being “true to
oneself” – there is in fact no self other than that
created in acts – but rather to emphasize that
the responsibility for one’s life rests only with
oneself. It does not entail that moral choice is
merely one of invention. To deny this freedom
is to act in “bad faith.” To live in full knowledge of our freedom, that we are responsible
for our life and cannot pass such responsibility
to an external authority – we would in any case
have to choose – is to live with authenticity.

To live capriciously and inconsistently with disregard for the consequences of one’s decisions,
and without commitment, would be to live
inauthentically.

`fairy tales 
Stories about fairies or, more generally, the fantastic; incredible or imaginative tales
of fantasy, often involving familiar, archetypal
characters and motifs, that have been woven into
the fabric of a culture’s memory. The fairy tale
has had a long and colorful life, migrating from
the communal fireside, to the salons of the elite,
to the nursery, to the psychologist’s couch, and
finally returning to the modern fireside equivalent,
the big screen.
Defining the literary genre of fairy tale and
deciding what falls under its categorization has
been a continual source of frustration for scholars,
as has been distinguishing the term “fairy tale”
from its older sibling, the equally elusive “folk
tale.” In general, it is agreed that the folk tale
has strictly oral origins, while the fairy tale has
evolved as a written genre, planting its roots –
albeit tentatively – in the literary. However,
despite this recognized alliance with the written,
the origins of many fairy tales can be seen as
progeny of an earlier oral tradition, most often
in cultures where storytelling figured largely as a
community’s vehicle for educational and moral
instruction, for the preservation and transmission
of its cultural history, and as a source of entertainment. Often literary fairy tales were reworkings of a prior, oral form, drawing on well
known motifs, plots, and characters in an effort
to create a more stable version of the story.
Until the mid-nineteenth century, folklorists and
scholars of the fairy tale believed that each tale had

its own, authentic original that was once specific
to a culture and that had since proliferated and
universalized. However, by the latter part of the
nineteenth century, folklorists realized that cultures
that had been geographically isolated from each
other had also concurrently possessed the same
stories. Consequently, due in part to the Aarne–
Thompson classification system that catalogued
tales based on their plot trajectory, as well as to
Vladimir Propp’s structural analysis of the Russian
folk tale, it is now maintained that there was a
polygenesis of certain archetypal stories that are
known globally.
Fairy tale scholar Jack Zipes tells us that the
predecessors of the modern, literary fairy tale
can be found in written form at least as early
as Aesop’s fables, as well as later in the Latin
folkloric writings of the Middle Ages and the collections of writers like Giambattista Basile and
Giovanni Francesco Straparola. However, it is
in seventeenth-century France that the fairy tale
appeared for the first time under the name
by which we know it today. Marie-Catherine
d’Aulnoy is credited with writing the first literary fairy tale, “L’île de la Félicité,” which she
embedded in her novel Histoire d’Hypolite,
comte de Duglas, in 1690. Furthermore, it was
d’Aulnoy’s collection of stories entitled Contes
nouveaux ou les fees à la mode that furnished the
genre with its name and began a fairy tale writing
vogue that was to last through the early eighteenth
century.

With the notable exception of Charles Perrault
and his Contes du temps passé, fairy tale writing
during this period in France was a trend dominated by women authors known as les précieuses.
The fairy tales or contes de fées written by the
précieuses differ considerably from the modern
understanding of the genre not only in their
intended audience, but also in other narrative elements. These tales, unlike the later “once upon a
time” stories, did not exist in a temporal vacuum
but instead made references to contemporary
society and tastes. In addition, the précieuses did
not employ a simple, naive style to tell their
stories, nor did they pretend to faithfully record
oral tradition. Though sometimes, in order to
lend an element of the folkloric to their stories,
the précieuses claimed that their tales were first
told to children by women of a lower station (usually servants), the writings of the précieuses were
intended neither for children, nor for the folk.
Instead, these stories were circulated among
intellectual members of the elite and achieved
popularity in the salons of Paris. Thus, though
at times a certain oral style was employed by the
authors of these texts, it was not the universal
expression of the folk that pervaded their narratives, but the sophisticated voice of an aristocratic
Frenchwoman speaking to a well educated,
cultured audience. The tales of the précieuses,
especially those of Madame d’Aulnoy, met with
success throughout much of the eighteenth century, encountering resistance only with the male
elite who belittled their style as too romantic
and the genre as too “precious.” However, in the
1698 publication of his Contes du temps passé,
Charles Perrault dedicates a significant part of
his preface to defending the burgeoning fairy
tale genre to its critics, who considered it to be
inferior to other literary forms. As a member of
the Académie Française, Charles Perrault took the
side of the Moderns in the famous debate known
as the Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes,
breaking with the traditional thought that literature of the Classical world was unattainable in its
perfection. Grafting the debate onto the fairy tale
question, Perrault not only claimed that similar
tales were written in Antiquity, but also insisted
that the contemporary French fairy tales were
actually superior in moral content to their ancient
predecessors. It is, therefore, Perrault who can be
credited with beginning to shape the conception

of the fairy tale as a pedagogical tool for the
moral instruction of children, as well as with
beginning to realign the fairy tale with the folk:
by apologizing for the lack of decoration in his
tales that had characterized their classical forerunners, Perrault intimated that the tales issued
from an unsophisticated class.
However, though Perrault’s literary reworkings were themselves praised for their successful
imitation of a simple, peasant style, the overall
genre of the fairy tale was still considered an
illegitimate literary tradition and remained marginalized as such until after the Enlightenment
period. The modern conception of the fairy
tale, as it was reconceived and legitimized by
the Brothers Grimm, only achieved status as a
justifiable genre due to the Romantic reaction
against Enlightenment rationalism. The attempt
to reaffirm a sense of cohesive national character
and subjective tradition by embracing the folk as
the representatives of German national heritage
spurred brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm on
their quest to preserve the stories of the German
peasant class. They claimed that in these tales there
remained a truth and a “German-ness” unaltered
by time or civilization, and therefore, by publishing their 1812 Kinder- und Hausmärchen, they
would be helping to preserve an authentic national
spirit.
However, though the Brothers Grimm encouraged the belief that they had invited peasant
storytellers into their home and transcribed what
they had heard directly into their manuscript, in
reality many of their informants were members
of higher classes, and the tales themselves often
already existed in some written form. In addition,
the Grimms were two of the first collectors of
fairy tales who began to alter the texts they
were preserving, not simply to make the stories
more appealing to their audience, but also in
an attempt to purify them of material considered
to be immoral. They meant for their collection
to be a manual of manners and thus in each tale
there was a lesson to be internalized by the child
reader. However, though many of the Grimm
tales offered their readers distilled moral content, fairy tale scholar Maria Tatar notes that
the Grimms additionally seemed to escalate the
violence in their stories. The villainy that propels
the plot of the fairy tale is vanquished with
extreme brutality, emphasizing the catastrophic

261
sense of moral obligation. However, Bettelheim
rejects the explicit moral addendum employed by
the Brothers Grimm and other fairy tale writers
in favor of open-ended conclusions, claiming
that the imaginative process of identification, or
empathy, is far more effective than didacticism.
Today, when examined from an anthropological perspective, fairy tales are considered part of
a cultural archive. When we read fairy tales, we
engage in a cultural legacy that connects us to
national heritages, hegemonic value systems, and
canonical ideologies that are both foreign and
familiar to our modern-day experience. Walt
Disney recognized and consequently capitalized
on the universal draw of fairy tales with his
animated feature films, which again made fairy
tales part of a cultural consciousness and mass
entertainment. In a sense, Disney gave the fairy
tale back to the folk by transferring to the big
screen what was once communicated around the
fireside. His adaptations have also added distinguishably American characteristics to the stories,
championing the underdog and emphasizing the
importance of hard work and perseverance in the
pursuit of happiness. However, though Disney’s
“American Dream” reinterpretations have revitalized interest in the fairy tale genre, Disney has
also received criticism for anti-feminist and racist
content and especially for the extreme infantilizing of the tales. However, though the diluted
Disney versions seemed to have distanced the
modern cinematic fairy tales from what Maria
Tatar has termed their “hard core” predecessors,
modern literary fairy tales, including the more
traditional tales of Andrew Lang, Carlo Collodi,
and Oscar Wilde, as well as the later works of those
who have extrapolated on the fairy tale, such
as Roald Dahl, Lemony Snicket, Angela Carter,
Gregory Maguire, and J.K. Rowling (whose “Harry
Potter” series is arguably the most elaborate fairy
tale of our time), have given the fairy tale back
its status as legitimate literature within a continuously evolving genre.

consequences that follow complicity with evil,

lethal dangers that face a person struggling to
remain on the path to virtue.
Unlike the Brothers Grimm, Danish fairy tale
writer Hans Christian Andersen was not a collector
of the oral traditions of the folk. Despite his
growing up in the storytelling culture of the
peasant class, Andersen’s fairy tales were indeed
literary imitations of oral folklore traditions,
but the stories themselves were imaginative products of his own invention. Andersen’s tales are
renowned for their enchanting beauty and stirring poetic language; however, like the Grimms,
Andersen was no stranger to violence. Having
witnessed during his childhood the powerful
influence exerted by the spectacle of punishment upon his own moral formation, in his tales
Andersen replaced this disciplinary tool with a
new concept of atonement through literature.
He used the earlier model of the public display
of discipline to put forth a revolutionized model
of regulation in his fairy tales: a child reading
his stories is made more obedient and docile
through interaction with the text and identification with the characters. In addition, critics have
demonstrated Andersen’s exploitation of his own
life story in the creation of his fairy tales, his
personal desires and anxieties being made manifest
throughout the fantastic adventures he describes,
his characters serving as alter-egos for the author
himself.
Bruno Bettelheim tells us in The Uses of
Enchantment that addressing the existential
anxieties and overwhelming desires of humanity
is the most profound function of fairy tales.
Championed by Bettelheim, who saw Oedipal
dramas in these stories, in recent decades fairy tales
have become recognized by child psychologists
not only as important agents of socialization that
help to answer a child’s major life questions,
but also as instruments for therapeutic recovery
when those life questions threaten to overwhelm
a person’s identity and happiness. By reading
stories that embody different facets of universal
conflicts and that unflinchingly deal with these
crises of being, children and adults are able to
acknowledge and confront their own personal
dilemmas from a secure distance. This form of
bibliotherapy, Bettelheim argues further, helps
children to relinquish narcissism and develop a

`Fanon, Frantz (1925–61) 
Martinican psychiatrist and revolutionary. After finishing his
medical studies, Fanon published Black Skin,
White Masks (1952), an existentialist psychological and socio-economic analysis of the effects
of colonization in Martinique, where European
Culture had imposed “an existential deviation”
(p. 16) on blacks. In that work, Fanon studied the
processes of “epidermalization” and “lactification” – the interiorization of an inferiority complex based on socioeconomic iniquities, and the
desire to “whiten the race” (p. 47) respectively.
By analyzing these phenomena, Fanon meant to
liberate “the man of color from himself” (p. 10),
to achieve “the effective disalienation of the
black man” (p. 12). In the opening chapter of Black
Skin, White Masks, “The negro and language,”
Fanon exposed the acculturating power of language
in the colonial context. Asserting that “to speak
is to exist absolutely for the other,” (p. 17)
Fanon critiqued the inferior status attributed
to Creole in favor of French as the language of
“civilization” in the Antilles and demonstrated that
the denigration of the local language as “inferior”
was a key to understanding the dehumanization
of colonization. Asserting that every colonized
people “finds itself face to face with the language
of the civilizing nation . . . the culture of the
mother country,” Fanon observed that to speak
the language of the colonizer was to carry the
(imposed) weight of an entire civilization, and
to bury one’s own traditions and history. In
chapter 5 of Black Skin, White Masks, “The fact
of blackness,” Fanon examined the benefits and
shortcomings of the negritude movement. While
he concluded that negritude was limited by its
positing of a universal black essence, Fanon
criticized Jean-Paul Sartre’s statement (in Black

Orpheus) that negritude was merely the negative
term in a dialectical progression where concerns
of race would be absorbed by an international
proletariat.
From 1953 to 1956 Fanon practiced medicine
at the psychiatric hospital at Blida-Joinville in
Algeria. In 1956 he resigned from his position,
protesting at the inhumane treatment of Algerian
patients by French doctors. In 1957 he was expelled
from Algeria, and went to Tunisia to work for the
Algerian nationalist National Liberation Front
(FLN). From Tunisia, he contributed to the

Colonialism is an account of his involvement in
the Algerian war of independence (1954–62). In
The Wretched of the Earth (1961), Fanon analyzed
political development in the Third World,
especially in Algeria and Africa, and elaborated
a theory of liberation rooted in violent action.
Arguing that force subtended the entire colonial
enterprise, Fanon believed that decolonization
could succeed only after the colonized had liberated themselves from the colonial heritage of
inferiority and submission by the use of force. In
The Wretched of the Earth Fanon wrote: “At the
level of individuals, violence is a cleansing force.
It frees the native from his inferiority complex
and from his despair and inaction; it makes him
fearless and restores his self-respect” (p. 73).
Critics of this position have pointed out the lack
of “illumination” that violence has in fact produced
in the postcolonial period, while others credit
the “mythic” power of Fanon’s message.

femininity A term with a dual meaning,
“femininity” refers first to the ensemble of cultural forms, meanings, and values conventionally
associated with women. Thus certain forms of
adornment (dress and makeup) or personal
qualities (passivity, mystery, sexual allure) have
functioned traditionally as cultural markers of
femininity. Secondly, “femininity” refers to
gender identity, to the sense of self that enables
social subjects to say “I” as a woman.
It is common in many areas of biological
and medical science to root distinctions between
women and men in biological differences. In this
account, femininity appears as a natural essence
which is both tied exclusively to women (thus
so-called effeminate men appear abnormal or
deviant), and whose influence is felt directly in
all areas of social life (thus women are deemed
“biologically” unsuited to certain types of work,
artistic activity, etc.; Gunew, 1990, p. 207). This
biological Essentialism has been a focus of debate
in numerous disciplines, from social science to
philosophy and Literary criticism. The main
impulse for a critique of essentialist versions of
femininity has come, however, from feminism.
Here, the argument that a woman’s biology is
her destiny is seen as a source of women’s
subordination; for if women are “naturally”
(anatomically, genetically, hormonally) inferior,
then feminist demands for women’s equality,
or for the cultural validation of femininity, are
null and void.

In theorizing the cultural acquisition of femininity, critics have engaged cultural-theoretical
debates on the question of the human Subject
and its philosophical status. Since the eighteenth
century, the dominant source of conceptions of subjectivity has been Enlightenment Humanism,
which assumes the human individual as a pregiven
entity, and ascribes to her/him a status as the
source of all action and meaning. The subject
of humanism is, importantly, ungendered; both
women and men may theoretically realize their
full potential as self-defining individuals.
In practice, however, women have regularly been
excluded from or marginalized within Culture
and history. Feminist critics of humanism have
looked therefore to theoretical traditions which
enable an understanding of sexual difference
and inequality, and thus relativize the supposedly
universal category of the human individual.
Various theories have been influential in dislodging the humanist subject from the center
stage of history. Marxism has offered an understanding of subjectivity as the product of socioeconomic determinants; thus femininity appears in
Marxist-feminist accounts as socially produced,
centrally via the sexual division of labor which
assigns to women the “feminine” labor of care
and nurturance (Barrett, 1988). Structuralism,
Poststructuralism, and Semiotics have sought
– albeit in very different ways – to understand
sociosexual identities as the products of language and cultural systems, of Discourses, to use
poststructuralist parlance, which are structured
outside of the human individual. Here femininity becomes a position in or an effect of culture,
rather than a pregiven essence bequeathed to
women by nature.
Psychoanalysis, finally, is similarly antihumanist in its conception of subjectivity as split
between conscious and Unconscious psychic
domains. Importantly, Psychoanalysis is also
centrally concerned with sexual identity and its
cultural formation. Freud’s account of sexual
identity as produced in the hitherto unsexed
infant during its passage through the Oedipus
complex has been especially influential (though
it has not gone uncontested within psychoanalysis
itself; see, for instance, Chasseguet-Smirguel,
1981). Lacan’s appropriation of Freud, with its
emphasis on the role of language in shaping sexual
identity, has also been formative, particularly

within so-called French feminism: thus the work
of Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, and Hélène
Cixous turns precisely on the issue that most
preoccupied Lacan, that of the part played by
language in producing sexual difference at the
psychic level.
In psychoanalysis, then, femininity appears
as the result of a complex process of psychic
development in infancy, a process which, moreover, is never fully achieved, since, as Jacqueline
Rose puts it, “the unconscious never ceases to
challenge our apparent identity as subjects”
(Mitchell and Rose, 1982).

`feminist criticism 
Feminist criticism has
grown mainly out of the modern feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, although it found
inspiration in earlier works such as Simone de
Beauvoir’s The Second Sex (1949) and Virginia
Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own (1928). Women
of many nationalities have developed its techniques
and analyses but the main activity has occurred
in the United States and in France. The two early
works of de Beauvoir and Woolf exemplify the
difference between French- and English-language
strands: the French book philosophizes and universalizes, drawing back from narrative, whereas
the English one is a literary work which turns often
to specific and personal story.
Early American feminist criticism of the later
1960s and early 1970s recognized no authority
and so is not associated with any one woman or

group of women. Nevertheless, it has achieved
considerable authority itself by working largely
within the universities and, many have charged,
colluding with the critical establishment. In its first
phase it was flamboyantly engaged and disputed
any notion of neutrality in criticism; insisting on
yoking personal and political, it often turned the
consumption of literature into a kind of therapy,
with criticism the account of a personal awakening. Such critics as Kate Millett found much
Canonical literature overtly misogynist and
implicated it in woman’s political and psychological oppression, while discovering in undervalued works such as Charlotte Brontë’s Villette
feminist messages hitherto concealed from readers.
Revising concepts of themselves, learning to
understand, for example, the libertine oppressive
nature of what had seemed the libertarian sexual
philosophies of the 1960s, feminist criticism
noted the stereotypes literature had foisted on
women, such as the femme fatale, the whore, the
angel in the house, and the moral guardian of man,
and it tied these representations to the degradation of women in life. Literary analysis, largely in
the hands of men, should be used by women to
control and influence meaning and to show that
gender is a fundamental determinant in literature
and life. American Literary criticism, which
had elevated those Texts most demeaning to
women, was especially attacked by such critics
as Annette Kolodny and Judith Fetterley, who
revealed the cultural betrayal of women. It was also
argued that male literary history had systematically downgraded the genres in which women
chose to write; for example, women’s domination
of the nineteenth-century American popular novel
had become simply a matter of regret in most
literary histories. This exclusion suggested that a
major task of feminist criticism was the reinscribing of women writers in history. This became the
agenda of the mid-1970s.
Opinions differed on whether women excluded
from the dominant tradition could be integrated
into a tradition that was constructed on the basis
of their exclusion or whether women could ever
be thought to constitute a separate tradition.
Some critics such as Ellen Moers seemed to suggest the creating of a separate women’s tradition,
whereas Elaine Showalter insisted that women
writers formed a subculture, not a culture; because
of the interrupted nature of women’s literary

265
most of these wished to avoid the label “feminist,”
regarding feminism as deeply implicated in the
masculine systems of thought. Through French
theory, Freud, scorned by Kate Millett and early
feminist critics, entered feminist criticism as a
force. French theory was attractive to many women
because it concentrated on inner life, not public
history, provided a ready-made language for discussing gender, and delivered academic status
and glamour through its intellectual difficulty.
Others felt profoundly ambivalent toward all
bodies of theory as male and feared the replacement of the concept of the woman writer with the
concept of the feminine in writing.
The French writers most influential in the
English-speaking world were Julia Kristeva,
Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. Despite great
differences, each came from an idealist philosophical tradition. They opposed those intellectual
modes that posited an empirical reality as deeply
flawed and Anglo-Saxon, and they tended like
Simone de Beauvoir to universalize rather than
historicize. They used techniques popularized
by Jacques Derrida, who denied the validity
of traditional rational thought, arguing that all
meaning of an event was temporary and relative,
and located in a relation of difference from all
other linguistic events. They were even more
heavily influenced by the psychoanalytical theories
of the Freudian revisionist Jaques Lacan, who also
argued for an absence at the center of language, but
from unconscious desire rather than linguistic
difference. The child has the illusion that the
language fulfills desires, since it exists in what was
called the symbolic order, the area of law, order,
the phallus, and the father. The girl coming to consciousness in language where gender identity was
composed was offered a series of subject positions
only through submission to the phallic symbolic
order. Taking the outlines of this Lacanian analysis, the French women theorists argued that,
if symbolic Discourse demanded submission
to the phallocentric and if women were indeed
alienated from linguistic cultural structures at
the profoundest level, then they might turn to a
nonsymbolic discourse and so escape the dominance of reason and logic. Irigaray and Cixous
posited a feminine writing, écriture féminine,
which was a utopian projection of femininity,
a writing from the body which came from a
pre-Oedipal, prelinguistic space anterior to the

feminist criticism

history, the transience of female fame and the
self-hatred that alienated women from a sense of
collective identity, it was impossible to speak of a
women’s tradition or movement. The culmination
of the effort of the mid-1970s to create a general
sense of women writers was Sandra Gilbert and
Susan Gubar’s The Madwoman in the Attic
(1979), which found in the already canonized
writers an essential pattern of repetition – the suppressed female. The authors agreed that women
writers responded to sociocultural constraints
by creating Symbolic narratives that expressed
common feelings of constriction, exclusion, and
dispossession, and they connected textuality and
sexuality, genre, and Gender, psychosexual identity and cultural authority. Together with most of
the early critics, Gilbert and Gubar concerned
themselves primarily with women writers of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and there
was little sense that their generalizations were
time- or Culture-specific. The concentration on
women writers was connected with the contemporary emphasis on distinctive female experience
such as motherhood, celebrated along with
female bonding and creativity by the poet critic
Adrienne Rich. Some critics took inspiration
from Nancy Chodorow’s revision of traditional
Freudian psychology to celebrate the maternal
principle, and from Mary Daly, who envisaged
the femaleness of deity and a transformation of
personality through language.
By the late 1970s American feminist criticism
was feeling the tug of theory, and a split occurred
between those who felt that feminist criticism
should develop a theory or utilize a male one and
those who saw any theory as the authoritarian
voice of Patriarchy. The latter wanted to continue the construction of a female framework for
analyzing women’s writing and the development
of models based on the study of female experience; they worried that theory would separate
feminist criticism from feminism as a political
cause. Whether pro- or anti-theory, most critics
became extremely self-aware and labels were
given to various aspects of study, for example,
Showalter’s gynocritics for the study of women
writers and the feminist critique for the study
of the representation of women. After a flirtation
with the American forms of Deconstruction, the
theoretically inclined turned excitedly towards
French women theorists, despite the fact that

symbolic. The Writing escaped the symbolic
order and its illusory fulfillment of desire, and
was connected with the rhythms, secretions, and
sexual organs of women; it became disruptive,
punning, and private. Écriture féminine operated
outside patriarchal structures on the edge of culture.
While partly viewing it as a biological possession
of women deriving from the mother, Cixous
argued that it might be produced by men or
women; but Irigaray, the most influential theorist on American feminist criticism of the late
1970s, denied this, insisting that it was a fluid and
creative writing from the female body. From a
different perspective Julia Kristeva posited a space
called the Semiotic, separate from the symbolic;
a space which, grounded on the mother, was the
place of semiotic flow, the source of anarchy,
disorder, ambivalence, and silence. The space
could function as the locus of disruption, displacing the symbolic order where the binary categories
of male and female fell into place, and it could
express femaleness before acculturation. The use
of semiotic seemed a more voluntary mode to
Irigaray and Cixous than the use of écriture féminine; it was open to either gender and available
within the symbolic order to challenge the combination of Masculinity and law. Kristeva,
Irigaray, and Cixous all made much of the
unrepresentability of woman, defining “Woman”
as what could not be said, what was beyond
ideologies and nomenclatures. Such views made
the empirical enterprise of American feminist
criticism seem absurd, since women writers of the
past whom it was trying to rescue had written
from within their experience, and experience in
the French view simply reinscribed the symbolic.
Only psychoanalysis with its desconstructing of
the difference that experience reiterated could
help women move forward. Ordinary discourse had
to be deconstructed and reinvented, and women
had to learn to speak outside the phallocentric and
logocentric structures.
The view of the French women theoreticians
had considerable influence on feminist criticism,
initially through departments of French. Some
critics began to use sophisticated verbal and philosophical desconstructions of Lacan and Derrida
with the intention of destabilizing the notion
of gender positions in texts; the works of Alice
Jardine, Gayatri Spivak, and Mary Jacobus were
examples, though none was as visionary as Cixous

or Irigaray. The Scandanavian theorist Toril Moi
used some of the analysis to attack the naivety of
American feminist criticism, while others such
as Elaine Showalter and Janet Todd defended
its historical, political, and general feminist aims
against what seemed a mystifying and simultaneously reductive analysis. Many women took
issue with the ideas of anatomy as textuality
and of a revolutionary break with patriarchal
language, and they noted the French women’s
reliance on privileged male texts, however deconstructed and desecrated, as well as their retreat
from political activism. At the same time other
women, such as Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline
Rose in England and Jane Gallop in the United
States, used some of the techniques of Deconstruction to criticize or develop the legacy of
Psychoanalysis.
In the later 1980s the use of techniques deriving from Lacan and Derrida and influenced by
French women theorists intersected with the ideas
of Michel Foucault and New historicism to
effect a change in the understanding of literary
and cultural history. Women such as Margaret
Homans, Ellen Pollak, and Terry Castle showed
the past dominance of male discourse and described the strategies women used to avoid it;
Catherine Gallagher and Nancy Armstrong read
literary texts in relation to other sorts of literature to examine ways in which the structuring
of gender relations informed relations to class;
others revealed how fear of women influenced
the development of scientific or philosophical
systems or movements, such as the Enlightenment or modernism. While these developments
were undoubtedly exciting, some critics, such
as Judith Newton, noted that many concepts
ascribed even by feminists to New Historicism,
such as the construction of subjectivity and sexuality, seemed to have been anticipated within
feminism, and she concluded that once again the
discourse of the less powerful did not escape the
conditions of its own production. In addition, such
analyses sometimes tended to bring together too
forcefully the physical and metaphysical and
rely too heavily on the pun and linguistic trick.
Simultaneously with these developments, many
more empirically inclined critics, seeing the passing
of the heroic universalizing of American feminist
criticism and noting the institutionalization of
women’s studies in the United States and to a far

267
Barbara Christian and Barbara Smith were
insistent that gender was not a unitary term nor
was experience universal, as early American
feminists seemed to have implied, and that race
made a radical difference to any analysis. Lesbian
critics also felt marginalized by feminist criticism.
Such women as Monique Wittig in France and
Adrienne Rich in the United States noted differences in reading and writing strategies and raised
the issue of whether there was a lesbian aesthetic
distinct from a feminist one. In the late 1980s Third
World women, especially those such as Spivak
working in the United States, focused attention
on colonialism and gender, so attacking again
the universalizing tendency of earlier feminist
criticism.

`feminist philosophy 
Central to the matter
of what feminist philosophy is are two related, if
not quite coordinated, questions. As philosophy,
can it be political enough to effect social change?
And if it is motivated by political concerns, is it
really philosophy after all? One encounters the
second of these questions not only in the doubting voices of those philosophers who would deny
feminism a place in their field but from feminists
themselves, who are at times deeply reflective of
the status of their own work and of the methods
and assumptions they employ (Bianchi, 1999). But

feminist philosophy

smaller extent in European countries, realized
that much historical spadework remained to be
done. Consequently there was a movement backwards in the study of English literature from the
Victorian and modern periods, which had been
the dominant concern of earlier critics, into
periods such as the Middle Ages and the eighteenth
century, and there was much closer study of specific groups of women, such as diarists or Civil
War pamphleteers, study which helped toward
the breakdown of hierarchial genres and literary
periodization.
While feminist criticism has not greatly influence traditional male scholarship, a few men
such as Terry Eagleton and Stephen Heath
have engaged with its findings, although their
efforts have been regarded as too mastering by
Showalter and Spivak. Many have raised the subject of masculinity; gay male critics in particular
have used some of the techniques of feminist
criticism to study the homophobia inscribed in
literature and culture. Occasionally there has been
fruitful work using the perspectives of women and
gay studies, but sometimes there has been acrimony between feminists and gay men jostling for
status as primary victims of the dominant culture.
From early on, feminist criticism was accused
of being middle-class, heterosexual, and white; in
the late 1960s and early 1970s Lillian Robinson
frequently chided it for ignoring class. This was
more a subject for British feminists, who usually
expressed a socialist allegiance, but the Marxist and
socialist character of the movement there made
women wary of elitism, university feminism, and
of engaging in a feminist criticism not immediately part of a wider feminist cultural critique. The
results were that not a great deal of critical work
was done in the 1970s on canonical writers, even
by the Marxist-feminist literature collective, and the emphasis was on popular culture
and a feminist analysis of Marxist literary theory.
The Marxist work which developed in the 1980s
in Britain and the United States tended to be heavily Althusserian, drawing on psychoanalytical
theory as well as Marxism. De Beauvoir and
Cixous had brought together oppressions of Race
and gender but they tended to use race as a
metaphor for gender. In the United States Alice
Walker found the term “feminism” racist and
coined “womanist” to refer to black women’s
writing practice and criticism; critics such as

feminist philosophy

268
the first may be the more compelling, for it is
a gauge by which feminist philosophers sometimes judge one another’s work. The charge that
postmodern feminism can lead only to quietism,
a substitution of academic jargon for political
activism, has its counterpoint in the concern that
analytical feminists concede too much ground to
long-held assumptions in philosophy and thus fail
to provide legitimate alternatives to intractably
biased notions, including reason, knowledge, and
moral agency. This entry addresses both questions
by showing what a deeply complex and varied field
feminist philosophy is.
A precise definition of feminist philosophy is
difficult to muster, for work within this field is
by no means unified. Common to most feminist
philosophy, as to feminism in general, is a conviction that women are oppressed by an unjust
hegemonic system that privileges and sustains
men and men’s desires. Feminist work is united
in the goal of ending women’s oppression, though
exactly what form that oppression takes or how
it can be effectively eliminated remains contentious. Feminist philosophy routinely defies rules
and challenges borders in its analysis of oppressive practices; it challenges traditional notions
about what counts as proper philosophical work,
sometimes seeks guidance in answering philosophical problems by crossing into subdisciplines
within the field (thus, we occasionally see feminist
analytic philosophers reach for Marxist concepts
and postmodernists invoke Spinoza: Gatens,
1996), and asks with heightened awareness how
it might itself inadvertently be replicating the
injustices it wishes to expose and eradicate. As part
of this heightened awareness, many contemporary
feminists have consciously moved away from a
“single oppression model” (Cohen, 2001), which
views patriarchal structures through a lens of
gender. Much feminist philosophical writing is
intersectional, acknowledging and analyzing deep
connections between other experiences of oppression, including racism, classism, heteronormativism, ableism, and anthropormorphism.
To name some of the recurring themes in
feminist philosophy – agency and embodiment;
reason, emotion, and knowledge; language;
ethical thinking – may be to suggest more
uniformity in thought than there really is on
these matters and to overlook the sometimes
rancorous disagreements over what these terms

signify. Tensions in feminist philosophy sometimes
arise in work that is located in two different traditions within Western philosophy, the analytic
and the continental. Briefly, analytic philosophy
(also called Anglo-American philosophy) places
a high value on clarity of argument, on logic, and
on science as a model of rational thought, while
continental philosophy (I mainly discuss Postmodernism) doubts that science and logic can
deliver to us timeless, universal claims, and it is
often expressed in playful, metaphorical language.
Feminist analytic philosophers have rooted out
male-bias in many key philosophical notions,
though they have not usually rejected the notions
of reason, knowledge, and agency, while continental feminist philosophers have been more
skeptical of these concepts and have turned their
thoughts to the body, specifically to notions of
sexual difference and the construction of sex
and gender. While there is some overlap among
writers in these various traditions, philosophers
sometimes seem to talk past one another;
engaged in apparently similar work, they come
from such different backgrounds that agreement
becomes elusive.
The strategies employed by feminists are likewise varied. Some philosophers dive into the
archives, recovering lost female voices from the
past and seeking to understand their work in
and against the period in which they lived and
wrote. Other important work has come in the form
of critical analyses of the sexist or misogynist views
held by such historical figures as Aristotle, Kant,
and Nietzsche, whose ideas exert tremendous
influence on philosophers today. Whether the
entrenched sexism of canonical philosophers
can be isolated from the more feminist-friendly
aspects of their work, or whether sexism infects
their work so thoroughly that a wholesale denunciation is in order, has been a source of disagreement. Thus, some feminists see their own
work as appropriating past philosophers whose
writings, despite flawed views about women,
nevertheless provide something useful to feminist
philosophy. Others seek a more radically feminist
voice, which repudiates oppressive practices and
replaces them with a specifically feminist, or even
feminine, way of approaching philosophy.
We can see how these various themes and
strategies play out in feminist philosophical work
on a few key topics: first, knowledge, and then,

269
only women can acquire certain forms of knowledge is problematic at several levels: it precludes
communication across genders, it reproduces
the troubling aspect of mainstream philosophy
that discounts certain persons as knowers, and
it ignores the diversity of women and women’s
experiences.
A significant amount of work in feminist
epistemology has centered on the “standpoint”
from which we acquire knowledge and on the
controversial notion of “epistemic privilege.”
Feminist standpoint theory derives from the
Marxist idea that workers can acquire an understanding of their own oppression under capitalism
that eludes their bourgeois oppressors (Hartsock,
1983). As a feminist theory, it accepts the idea that
all knowledge is situated and culturally informed,
and it further argues that women’s experiences
produce “a view of the world that is more reliable and less distorted than that available either
to capitalist or to working-class men” (Jaggar,
1983). The idea is not that women share a gendered
cognitive style, but rather that their situated
perspective – their collection of experiences as
members of an oppressed group – affords them
the possibility of knowledge not available to those
outside this perspective. The claim is political, and
it is optimistic; it promises that we can acquire
knowledge of oppressive structures and offers the
hope of altering those structures. One problem
with the view, of course, is that our experiences
and our reflection on these experiences may be
distorted by the very same oppressive structures
about which we may claim knowledge. Some early
versions of standpoint theory were also susceptible to the objections we saw above, particularly
to the charge of essentialism. These versions overlooked differences among women’s perspectives
and among other socially marginalized groups.
Pointing to the plurality of marginalized groups,
Bat-Ami Bar On (1993, p. 89) asks: “is any one
of these groups more epistemically privileged
than the others, and if that is not so – if they are
all equally epistemically privileged – does epistemic
privilege matter?”
More effective work in standpoint theory has
embraced the idea of a plurality of perspectives,
which moves it closer to the postmodern theories we turn to next. Thus standpoint theory
has moved away from the idea that “women’s”
perspective is privileged to an acknowledgment of

feminist philosophy

briefly, sexual difference. This range of topics
is by no means comprehensive; important work
has been done on identity, Ethics, Phenomenology, and Psychoanalysis, to name a few
areas rich in feminist philosophical debate. (For
more on these topics, see, respectively, Alcoff,
2000; Brennan, 2002; Bartky, 1990; Mitchell,
1974). But it affords us a window into feminist
philosophical debate, in a way that illuminates both
its political nature and its seriousness.
Mainstream epistemology – the study of
knowledge and justification – has long conceived
of a Cartesian thinker as an ideal epistemic
agent, an individual whose path to knowledge is
transcendental; that is, he can arrive, through
an exercise of pure intellect, at truths that are
objective, value-neutral, timeless, and universal.
The hallmark of such thinking is propositional
knowledge, expressed by the formula “S knows that
p,” where S is some generic and interchangeable
knower and p is some proposition that he is
justified in believing to be true. (The “he” in
these two sentences is not accidental, of course;
feminist philosophers have asserted that such
a knower has been implicitly assumed to be
male.) Against this view, feminist philosophers
have argued that knowledge is “situated,” that we
acquire it through socially and culturally formed
perspectives. They stress the contexts in which we
acquire knowledge, the embodied experiences
that generate knowledge, the intersubjectivity of
knowledge produced within communities, the
possibility of gendered styles of cognition, and the
extent to which women, and other disempowered
persons, have been denied the status of knowers.
Serious attempts at developing feminist theories
of knowledge have come from various quarters.
Some challenges to mainstream epistemology have
advocated expanding our definition of knowledge
to include ways of knowing traditionally practiced
by women. For instance, Vrinda Dalmiya and
Linda Alcoff (1993) have argued for something
they call “gender-experiential knowledge,” which
is a kind of situated knowledge that derives
from experience; their example is of an illiterate
midwife who gains a kind of non-propositional
knowledge from many years of delivering babies,
her own and others’. But such a view is open
to the charge of essentialism – the assumption
that some trait is universal for all women, in
this case a special style of cognition. That all and

multiple interlocking, and sometimes conflicting, perspectives. Sandra Harding argues that
knowledge-seeking (she is particularly focused
on scientific inquiry, but the claim applies more
broadly) should start from the perspectives of
marginalized and oppressed persons, despite the
many tensions and outright contradictions one
encounters among these various perspectives.
These tensions are to be welcomed, for it is “thinking from a contradictory position that generates
knowledge” (Harding, 1991, p. 285). What is
more, feminist standpoint theory operates with a
notion of objectivity that poses a direct challenge
to the value-neutral objectivity posited by mainstream epistemology. Harding and others argue
that because knowledge is always situated, knowledge claims that purport to reflect a “view from
nowhere” actually distort reality, for they claim
a neutral, perspective-free authority that simply
doesn’t exist in the world. More objective knowledge claims are those that admit to being situated
and limited in scope (Haraway, 1988).
Postmodern feminists embrace the idea of
multiple perspectives, though they take the further step of rejecting the idea of any permanent
reality that could be the subject of our knowledge.
Such a view has its locus in a broader postmodern
skepticism about meaning, truth, and reality. Postmodern philosophers are deeply critical of the idea
that we can escape from our situated locations and
lay claim to universal, timeless, objective truths
about a fixed reality. Instead, they argue, our relationship to the world is always mediated through
signs – indeed, reality itself is constructed discursively and, as such, it is in constant flux. Our
perspectives do not reveal a world out there awaiting our discovery; instead, our social and cultural
practices construct our world. This view is closely
tied to an account of language that denies the
fixity of concepts. Our words have meaning not
because they are linked to objects in the world
but through their connections with one another.
(See entry on Saussure.) Thus, the addition of
a new concept into this intricately woven system
effectively alters the meaning of every other
concept; the linguistic structures that shape our
thoughts and practices are in constant flux and
infinitely alterable. Just how much control we can
exercise in altering these practices, and thus our
world, is a matter of debate among postmodernists,
and it is particularly important to postmodern

feminists. The multiplicity of perspectives and
the fluidity of language seem to suggest that
there are endless ways of constructing a world. But
in actuality, postmodernists argue, those with
power exert disproportionate influence over our
social practices and, as a result, over our sense
of the world and our place in it.
Postmodern feminists look for ways to disrupt
or subvert those systems of meaning that ensure
power for a relative few and the continued subordination of others. Some, most prominently
Luce Irigaray and Hélène Cixous, have sought
means of confronting the Phallogocentrism
of our linguistic system. Their work challenges,
in various ways, the Lacanian psychoanalytic
notion of the symbolic order, which places men
at the center of language and women outside of
it. (See also Kristeva.) Other feminist philosophers have developed subversive strategies that
depend upon the idea we encountered above,
that we inhabit multiple perspectives. They tend
to mean by this both that membership in different
communities produces a plurality of perspectives
among human beings and that our experience
of ourselves is infinitely fragmented as well. This
plurality allows us to engage, deliberately and
responsibly, in perspective-shifting (what Lugones,
1987, calls “world-traveling”). The idea is that
we can intentionally reject those scripts handed
down by the dominant forces in our society by
knowingly adopting or mimicking others. How we
do this, and what the political consequences of it
might be, are among the questions postmodern
feminists contend with. In her work on the performativity of gender, Judith Butler (1990, 1993)
argues that our bodies become sexed through a
continual process of acting and re-enacting certain gendered roles; this repetition occurs within
a hegemonic system that shapes the very possibilities of the roles we can enact. If the creation of
the sexed being comes from repeatedly enacting
certain social norms, we may be able to knowingly
disrupt the system by acting against those norms.
Other feminists, however, believe that the disruption of oppressive structures involves more
than just performance, it also involves a critical
awareness of the images and metaphors we use
to represent our world (Oliver, 1999).
Underlying all this work is the notion of
sexual difference, which, despite crucial differences about how to employ the term, is central

271
merely reactionary, as reprimanding mainstream
philosophy for its biases and oversights and
recommending modifications when needed to
existing theory, feminist philosophy has emerged
as a discipline in its own right. Work in feminist
philosophy has provided a much-needed corrective for mainstream philosophy while at the
same time developing new insights that have
significant social and political consequences. We
can see this in Virginia’s Held’s repudiation of
the idealized moral agent, a figure much like the
Cartesian thinker we have encountered: “how
artificial and male-biased is the individual of
classical liberal theory, springing full-blown out
of nowhere into a self-sufficiency from which he
considers entering into social relations” (Held,
1999, p. 95). This imagined agent, whose reasoning
is impartial, detached, and disinterested, is a
fantasy. Real people live messier existences, move
in and out of relationships with others, and
develop a sense over time of their own identity,
and feminist philosophy is keenly aware that a
workable theory must acknowledge this other
agent, the partial, attached, and interested agent,
so that, as Held goes on to say, “of course we must
rethink the social and political theory built around
this concept of person.” A reworking of theory,
sometimes from the ground up, is the collective
enterprise of feminist philosophy.

to postmodern feminist discourse. The concept
of sexual difference regards the body as both
a “privileged site of difference” and a “universally held human trait” (Cahill and Hansen, 2003,
p. 11); it grants the embodied nature of our
experiences but also the deep differences in the
experiences we have as women and as men.
Some philosophers, like Irigaray, grant that
sexual differences between men and women
have real existence. Acknowledging sexual differences can counteract the tendency in Western
cultures to define women in relation to men – as
“lacking” or as lesser versions of men, and as the
wives, mothers, and helpmates of men. Butler,
on the other hand, rejects the notion of fixed
gender identities and views sexual difference as
itself constructed by the repetition of gendered
roles. Sex and gender appear natural because
sexual difference is continually reasserted by
cultural practices; acknowledging sexual difference, therefore, will help us to resist oppressive
practices.
Against postmodern feminism, critics have
lodged several objections. The first is that a
rejection of any stable epistemological categories
(including logic and reason), combined with the
idea of a plurality of perspectives, leads to relativism; it is hard to see how the postmodernist
can establish any criteria for judging the truth or
falsity, or the fairness or unfairness, of competing perspectives. The second might be called the
problem of disunity; if our perspectives – including our perspectives of the self – are multiple and
fragmented, it is unclear how our understanding
of these perspectives could be unified enough to
motivate us to engage in subversive work. Postmodern feminists often reject even the concept
of “woman,” denying that there is any fixed and
inclusive set of properties that meaningfully
defines this term. But there is some political
advantage to using the term and some hope that
we can develop an adequately sensitive definition (Haslanger, 2000, p. 39). The third problem
critics of postmodernism raise is the most worrisome: that in acting deliberately against certain
norms, we will reauthorize them. The risk of
insisting on sexual difference is that it reinforces
the very dichotomies feminist philosophers wish
to deconstruct.
In conclusion, though it may be tempting
for some to conceive of feminist philosophy as

`feral children 
When, in the mid-eighteenth
century, Linnaeus was setting out the method of
nomenclature that we use still today to identify
animals by genera and species, he was puzzled
by the variety of human beings. There were, it was
reported, people with tails (Homo caudatus), the
apes collected in his employer’s garden (Homo
simia), mankind who lived in the dark (Homo
troglodyte), humankind who called, siren-like
(Homo marinus) – even human children reared
by wild creatures. These he chose to characterize
as members of the genus Homo, but the species
ferus.
He knew of ten such children from the literature then available. Today, we can count studies
of over 400 reported feral children. These are
not to be confused with children so raised and
made prominent in fiction nor those real children
merely isolated and confined by human captors,
nor “wild men” brought from a childhood elsewhere when brought into Western culture. In
contemporary usage, “feral children” are human
children raised with, and maintained by, nonhuman animals.
The presumed importance of feral children is
the possibility that they may provide clues as to
what aspects of the human brain and behavior are
inborn and which are acquired through association with human culture. Feral children are to
be found in both fiction and non-fiction alike:
often it is unclear which category is appropriate.
“Feral” children are discovered several times a year.
After the media have reported the story, little
further useful information is gathered.
The fictional cases are to be found especially
in the European literature of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. A number of these novels
have been collected and reported by Georges
Dodds. An earlier, stimulating, analysis based on
the fictional Tarzan series is reported by Rudolph
Altrocchi (1944). Accounts and commentaries on
non-fictional situations are reported by Andrew
Ward (www.feralchildren.com.)
Of the presumably non-fictional examples of
human feral upbringing, the most completely

documented are, for living persons, John
Ssebuyana of Uganda and Vicente Antolin, called
Cau Cau, of Chile. John is said to have been
raised by monkeys when he was abandoned near
Bambo, Uganda. He was found when approximately four years of age and reared in a boarding
school. He has been featured in two documentary films, one by the British Broadcasting
Corporation and one by National Geographic
Television. Cau Cau, also abandoned, was rescued
in southern Chile and sent to a home in Santiago
where, in time, he was adopted by his speech
teacher. She kept a journal of her attempts to
educate and civilize him and he is the subject
of a documentary, but fictionalized, account by
a relative-by-adoption (Vila, 1999). When an
adult, but not when a child, he described being
raised by a jaguar during the time of abandonment. He is the subject of a short documentary
made by Chilean television. For several decades,
his family has refused permission for further
documentation.
When the detail of the lives of John and Vicente
is examined, there are similarities between the
living feral children and the better documented
situations of the past: Victor, of Aveyron (1789?–
1828), Amala (1919?–21) and Kamala (1912?–29)
of India. In both situations, the children were
removed to a facility in which serious attempts
were made to determine the nature of their minds
when uncontaminated by human Culture and
to determine what they might learn through culture, with special attention on their speech and
understanding. None was able to achieve a level
of skill in language and mathematical reasoning
much above that of a small child. Attempts by the
caretakers (Dr Itard and M. Guérin for Victor;
Mrs Singh and Dr Singh for Amala and Kamala)
were tireless and frustrating. The two most prominent living such children, John and Vicente,
have achieved a level of acculturation that allows
independence with supervision and a reasonable,
if below average, ability to use language. (Although
Kaspar Hauser of Bavaria (1818?–33) and Genie
(1957–) of Los Angeles are often placed in the same
category as feral children, they appear to have been
isolated from most human contact rather than
raised by a non-human animal.)
Among the clearly fictional uses of ferality,
Burroughs’s series of books using Tarzan as a
grown, but developmentally feral, child is the

`Feyerabend, Paul (1924–94) 
AustroAmerican philosopher, who with Kuhn and
Imre Lakatos (1922–74) was one of the main
post-Popperian philosophers of science. Following war service in the German army and studies
in Vienna, Feyerabend spent time in Britain
working with Karl Popper before moving in
1958 to California, where he was a professor at
Berkeley. After early papers on the philosophy
of quantum physics, Feyerabend wrote some
highly influential papers critical of empiricist
philosophy of Science. However, as the title
of one paper – “How to be a good empiricist” –
suggests, Feyerabend was not totally repudiating the empiricist approach, but was criticizing
the narrowness of the dominant conception of
science.
In its place he argued for theoretical proliferation, claiming that scientists should work not with
one theory to the exclusion of all rivals, but with
a range of incompatible theories, each of which
could suggest fruitful ways forward, while all
could be sources of empirical criticism. In this way
the production of both theories and empirical tests
could be maximized, and science would benefit.
Feyerabend also rejected traditional claims that

Feyerabend, Paul

best known, no doubt because the stories transferred so popularly to film. As Dodds has shown,
fictional works from 1701 to 1922 often featured
the ferocity of the animal and, in the case of
monkeys, their willingness to save human beings
from various disasters.
Vercors’s novel You Shall Know Them (1952)
may be the most intellectually engaging of this
genre. In this novel, a human being mates with
a non-human primate, then kills the offspring,
leading a jury to consider the question: is this
act murder or cruelty to animals? Vercors uses
this device to allow figures in the trial to consider
what it means to be human; however, as the
death of the infant occurs promptly, there is not
the opportunity for the being to be raised or
cultivated.
A subcategory of ferality is composed of human
beings brought from the assumed wild to culture
and civilization. Three situations are the most
frequently documented: the life of Ota Benga
(1881?–1916), raised in the Kalahari desert
but housed and “displayed” at the New York
Zoological Society (Bronx Zoo), Minik (Wallace),
a Lapland Eskimo, taken by Admiral Peary with
members of his family to New York, where he lived
in the American Museum of Natural History
(1890–1918), and Ishi (1860?–1916), a native
American, thought to be the last of the Yahi
tribe and removed to San Francisco and both
befriended and studied by anthropologists. (For
Ota Benga, see Bridges, 1974; Bradford and Blume,
1992; for Mimik, see Harper, 1986; for Ishi, see
Kroeber, 1961; Heizer and Kroeber, 1979.)

scientific development is cumulative, and, like
Kuhn, used the idea of incommensurability.
By the time he wrote Against Method Feyerabend was developing his ideas in opposition to
those of Lakatos, whose “methodology of scientific research programmes” he saw as a beneficial
but still insufficiently radical adjustment of
Popper’s methodology. The book was to have
been a joint venture with Lakatos, but his early
death frustrated this project. So Feyerabend’s
part of the book appeared alone and, with its
slogan that in science “anything goes,” caused
much contumely to be heaped upon the head
of its author. This anarchist (or in Feyerabend’s
preferred term, “Dadaist”) theory of knowledge
resulted from his claim that any notion of a fixed
scientific method is untenable on historical, philosophical, and political grounds. Feyerabend’s
apparent irrationality in refusing to expel such
things as propaganda and voodoo from science
did not recommend the book to the intellectual
establishment.
It is not clear what sort of reputation Feyerabend will leave. Much of his work on physics
and methodology will continue to be influential,
while his later books could become resources
for those who want to challenge complacency in
ideas, for eventually he generalized his notion
of proliferation, suggesting that science should
take its place alongside religion, Art, myth, etc.,
none having any exclusivity but each offering
some potentially liberating view of the world.
His overall self-assessment was that he was a
social philosopher, concerned with the perennial
philosophical quest for the good life. In fact
Feyerabend’s social philosophy is the weakest part
of his writings, veering somewhat unstably between
an extreme individualism, in which everything
(including one’s scientific allegiances) is a matter
of personal taste, to an extreme democracy, in
which everything (including scientific theories)
is put to the popular vote. Perhaps this shows
what happens when the exceedingly fertile seeds
of a central European education in physics and
philosophy, history and drama are allowed to
germinate under the Californian sun.

`film studies 
Film studies is not an arcane
subject, but it may very well be a nonsubject, in
so far as there is no coherent body of work that
can be adduced, and, although there is plenty of
dogmatism in discussing film, there is no party
line to hew to or rebel against. The term suggests that there is such a body of work, made
up of serious theoreticians. But who are they?
The Soviets, Kracauer, Bazin, Cavell, Deleuze,
perhaps, all decidedly different in their views
of film. The crucial fact is that it has been the
best of the film makers who have been the best
students of film. Although there have been some
valuable thinkers about the art, considered
below, the truest studies in film have come from
its practitioners, the directors. They developed,
broadened, revised, and disturbed film making,
and the best of them knew exactly what they
were doing.
Hence “film studies” should be an essay on
films, how directors created them with very clear
intentions, not on writing about films. When
Miklos Jansco made Winter Sirocco (1969), using
only 13 shots in fewer than 100 minutes, he was
a theoretician as well as a director, for what he
did was radical, a test of how far one could push
an idea: could audiences follow the choreography
of actors and a mobile camera for such lengths
of time? To write about the “theory” of that film
would be pointless; it had been done. And the best
directors, perhaps a dozen or so, have been both
makers and critics of the art. The proper analogy
is John Keats and his sensitivity and understanding of “negative capability.” His sparrow in the
gravel is eloquent.
Oddly, film as a medium first and then as
an art, from its beginnings in the late nineteenth
century, evoked very little reflection for the first
30 years of its existence. In the early days it was
the work of practitioners, part of an industry

275
“movie stars.” Benjamin was writing in exile,
as Europe was drawing toward the 1939–45 war,
and his essay’s anti-fascism and socialism can
still speak to us.
It was in the 1940s that film studies began
to appear. Siegfried Kracauer’s Theory of Film
(1947) reflects some very basic thoughts about
film and “the nature of reality.” “Films alienate
our environment in exposing it.” On film, a
leaf in a breeze or a bit of river in motion, not to
speak of the gesture of a woman’s hand or the
mobility of a crowd, show familiar things in a way
that transforms them. In one sense Kracauer
merely states the obvious, but it is an obvious
fact that needed to be presented in his careful,
well-organized fashion.
In a similar way Bela Balazs (1945) confronts
his readers with the close-up, especially a face on
the screen. “Facing an isolated face takes us out
of space, our consciousness of space is cut out and
we find ourselves in another dimension.” And
further, “it is much easier to lie with words than
with the face,” which film consistently proves.
Balazs’s pages on Dreyer’s Jeanne d’Arc (1928), the
last great silent film, should be recognized for their
simple brilliance. The examination of Jeanne is
a long scene of faces, Falconetti as the Maid
ultimately overpowering all the male faces of
her inquisitors with her genuine conviction, in
close-up. It is one of the magisterial passages
in all the years of cinema, one that all students
should revere and see again and again. We are witnessing the unsayable, the knowledge of which is
what Wittgenstein means by physiognomy.
It was throughout the 1930s and 1940s that
a few directors, notably Renoir, Welles, and
Rossellini, advanced the art of film making, and
their theorist, André Bazin, editor of Cahiers de
Cinéma, followed them shortly. For this writer,
Bazin remains the most valuable of thinkers about
film, although he died in 1958. Jean Renoir,
probably the greatest of film directors, even
suggested, in his preface to volume I of Bazin’s
collected essays, What Is Cinema?, that film itself
might die, the hundreds of millions of feet of
celluloid decayed in their cans, but that people
would still be reading Bazin, reconstructing that
lost world from his words.
Bazin, of course, understood the necessity and
value of montage, although he was very alert to
the limitations of the Soviet method and how, in

film studies

seeking profits. That they were to develop it into
an art was inevitable. D.W. Griffith, the greatest
of those early directors, because he was adept in
finding new ways of telling a story, by understanding how time was flexible and how space
could be a toy in a director’s hand by cutting, and
by the use of close-ups and other devices, sounds
like Joseph Conrad (perhaps echoing him?)
when he said, “I just want to make you see,” but
that is the remark of an artist, not a student
of film.
The first film studies of any value, however, do
come from directors, the Russians Eisenstein
and Pudovkin, developing from Kuleshov, one
of those who had watched, over and over again,
a bad print of Griffith’s Intolerance, which had
somehow made its way to Moscow after the
Bolshevik Revolution. Their thinking came directly
from their own work in creating what is now called
“Soviet montage,” which, important as it is, will
sadly be found in only a half-dozen years of the
1920s. Their concepts of montage were diverse,
Eisenstein believing (and that he could create)
in “collision,” while Pudovkin saw it in terms
of “linkage.” Nevertheless, for the first time there
were thoughtful ways in which to consider the
new art. Each certainly believed that the films he
made (in the 1920s) manifested his theory, but it
would take a very long essay to attempt to show
that Potemkin (Eisenstein) differed theoretically in montage from The End of St Petersburg
(Pudovkin). Both, however, saw correctly and
said in a joint manifesto that sound films would
“destroy the culture of montage” (1928). And,
in a cruel irony, the simultaneously tightening
grip of Stalinism began to make it impossible
for either to create the films he envisaged, conceivably adapting already established montage.
Further, one may suspect that neither director
would have written about film theory had he
been able to produce freely.
In the 1930s everyone went to the movies, it
seemed, but only Walter Benjamin gave them
some thought. His essay of 1935 introduced the
concept of “the aura,” the uniqueness of an object
or person, which could not now, on film, be
mechanically reproduced: “man has to operate
with his whole living person, yet forgoing the aura.
For aura is tied to his presence, there can be no
replica of it.” It is an appealingly cross-grained idea
in a period of dazzling, perhaps worshipped,

film studies

a number of different ways, it had filtered into
French and American movie making. What
Bazin saw, especially first in Renoir and Welles,
was how the deep focus shot, used with the
very long take and mobile camera (in Renoir’s
masterpiece, Rules of the Game, 1939, there are
only 337 shots in 110 minutes, an outstandingly
low ratio), made for a new, richer kind of film
making. The heart of Bazin’s thinking lies in his
essay “The evolution of the language of cinema”:
(1) depth of focus brings the spectator into a
relation with the image closer to that which
he enjoys with reality. Therefore . . . independently of the contents of the image, its
structure is more realistic;
(2) that . . . implies, consequently, both a more
active mental attitude on the part of the
spectator and a more positive contribution
on his part to the action in progress. While
analytical montage only calls for him to
follow his guide . . . here he is called upon
to exercise at least a minimum of personal
choice. It is from his attention and his
will that the meaning of the image in part
derives.
(3) From the two preceding propositions, which
belong to the realm of psychology, there
follows a third which may be described as
metaphysical, montage . . . by its very nature
rules out ambiguity of expression. . . . On the
other hand, depth of focus reintroduced
ambiguity into the structure of the image if
not of necessity . . . at least as a possibility.
(What Is Cinema? vol. I, 35–6)
Bazin went on to show how the Italian neorealists (their own term was verismo, indicating a
slight difference that matters), chiefly Rossellini
and de Sica, were concerned to preserve the
ambiguity of reality, seeking to transfer to the
screen its continuum, often in the close-up of
the face of a child. Jean Renoir, though, is properly
the hero of Bazin’s seminal essay.
[Renoir] alone in his searchings as a director prior
to Rules of the Game forced himself to look back
beyond the resources provided by montage
and so uncovered the secret of a film form that
would permit everything to be said without
chopping the world up into little fragments,

that would reveal the hidden meanings in people
and things without disturbing the unity natural
to them.

Bazin’s book on Renoir, edited by François
Truffaut, is essential, for he discusses or notes most
of the films in Renoir’s long career. Truffaut put
it together from reviews and memoranda, so it
is necessarily somewhat scrappy. Nevertheless,
it contains, in his sharp, sure way, much of what
went into Bazin’s thesis, still unsurpassed, of
how Renoir changed the way films can be made
and how we view them. Only shortly after Bazin’s
untimely death the nouvelle vague, made up of
directors who had first been critics for Cahiers
de Cinéma, were creating film after film of a vast
variety of kinds that can be seen as stemming from
their work with and understanding of Bazin. This
was contemporaneous with Fellini’s masterpiece,
8 1/ 2, moving beyond his earlier neorealistic work.
One wants to ask: Does the shade of Bazin feel
fulfilled?
For film study, there has been little in English
to engage one’s attention. A few critics have
written brilliantly about particular films, but
they are workers in the field, none of them ready
to posit an aesthetic. Even Susan Sontag, whose
essays on Bergman and Godard (Styles of Radical
Will, 1969) open up some new possibilities for
thinking about film, has never put forward a
coherent theory concerning film, as she did about
photography. To pick up an earlier concept, is
this because she herself has been a film maker and
continues to write fiction? First of all, she is an
artist.
The other writer in English worth listening to
is Stanley Cavell, a man who could talk about
Hawks’s Bringing Up Baby for many days: he loves
film. For him, to study films is by remembering
them, like dreams, which is true for everyone,
although, as with Kracauer and others, an obvious
fact not put into print before. He is gifted at telling us what we already know: “The ontological
conditions of the motion picture reveal it as
inherently pornographic” – Bazin’s keyhole, the
voyeur of many others. Cavell, more than any other
writer, makes the experience of watching a film
a bodily one, kinetic. He knows where he is, connected to the strange fact of the thrust of light
across an auditorium and images on a flat screen
pretending to be three-dimensional, and how he

director, was also the critic who, controversially, introduced the theory of “la politique des
auteurs,” arguing that the director making his films,
one after the other, like a poet or a novelist, will
be a recognizable “author.” The auteur theory
redeemed style, which was easy to see in Griffith,
Chaplin, Keaton, and the Soviets, but not clear
at all for film makers working with sound from
the 1930s to the 1960s. For example, Howard
Hawks, considered an auteur, made comedies,
westerns, historical epics, and adventure films
over many years in Hollywood, but they all
manifest the Hawks style. Truffaut, basically a
film maker, gave the art a new critical concept.
That is the way “film studies” have been, for the
most part.

Situations could be extreme, or . . . those of
everyday banality . . . what tends to collapse, or
at least to lose its position, is the sensory-motor
schema which constituted the action-image of the
old cinema. And thanks to this loosening of the
sensory-motor linkage, it is time . . . which rises
up to the surface of the screen. Time ceases to
be derived from the movement, it appears in itself
and itself gives rise to false movements. Hence the
importance of false continuity in modern cinema:
the images are no longer linked by rational cuts
and continuity, but are relinked by means of
false continuity and irrational cuts. (Deleuze,
1989, vol. 2, p. xi)

like so much written about film, but only if one
thinks about it, which so few do. “Film studies,”
then, is dry ground, not much has grown there,
and the best students invariably point out the

Fish has become the founding father and one of
the leading exponents of American reader-oriented
criticism.
In the 1960s, during the heyday of Structuralism, Fish published his Surprised by Sin:
The Reader in Paradise Lost (1967), which today
is considered the first book working within the
framework of the now surging field of Readerresponse criticism.

physically reacts to all of that, another obvious
but most important fact. However, he will be
larger, of course, asking: “How could film be art,
since all the major arts arise in some way out of
religion?. . . . Because movies arise out of magic;
from below the world” (Cavell, 1971).
Stepping forward, the only recent writer on film
who makes one reconsider chiefly the films of the
mid-twentieth century – sadly, perhaps, the peak
of film making – is Gilles Deleuze, whose two
volumes of Cinema (1986; English translation
1989) develop the thesis that “the movementimage of the classical cinema gave way, in the postwar period, to a direct time-image.” This break
happens because of the devastation of European
cities in the war, causing “situations which we
no longer know how to react to, in spaces we no
longer know how to describe.” Rossellini’s trilogy
speaks eloquently to him here:

novel, play, poem, do?” (1980, pp. 26–7) as
opposed to the – more conventional – question,
what does a literary Text mean?
Fish’s reader-oriented theory is programmatically called “affective stylistics,” because Fish
challenges the New Critics’ warning against the
Affective and the Intentional fallacy by
turning it against itself. Whereas the New Critics
argue that meaning resides in the formal features
of a poem, rather than in the reader’s emotion
or the author’s intention (see New Criticism),
Fish holds that both formal features and authorial
intention are only ever affected by the conventions
the readers bring to bear on the Text. They do
not exist outside the “informed” readers’ experience. The readers’ experience, in turn, is socially
constructed: the readers’ responses are not controlled by the text they read – a text, Fish argues,
can mean anything – but by the Interpretive
community they belong to. In Fish’s theory,
reading becomes the product of a set of shared
community assumptions.
While being clearly indebted to both Wolfgang
Iser’s theory of aesthetic response and Jacques
Derrida’s poststructuralist philosophy of Discourse, Fish’s stance is at once less comprehensive
than Iser’s and less radical than Derrida’s.

`folk culture 
“Folk culture” is a term which only
make conceptual sense by reference to a particular interpretation of “industrial culture.” As

Shiach (1989) shows, the idea of the “folk” was
developed in the context of industrialization,
and can only be understood by reference to
the critique of industrial society developed by
Romanticism. Folk culture described the culture
of preindustrial (premarket, precommodity)
communities, and was therefore taken to be
organized around a number of characteristics:
the oral transmission of songs, tales, and history;
aesthetic authorization by tradition; the integration of nature and Culture, body and mind;
expression through Ritual, in the collective
deployment of Symbols. There are obvious similarities between such descriptions of European
folk cultures and anthropological accounts of
communities in Africa and Asia, but “folk” is
not an anthropological term. It is an ideological
construct; it necessarily includes a critique of
“modern” societies.
The idea of folk culture has in fact served
a number of different political and cultural ends
(see Harker, 1985). As an aspect of nationalist
Ideology, folk culture is taken to be expressive
of the true spirit of a nation, of its underlying
beliefs and values, as articulated in specific forms
of dress, speech, music, story telling, cookery,
design, etc. Thus folk music – and folk music
collecting – became an essential part of the construction of European national identities in the
nineteenth century (and folk songs and dances
were a feature of the “national” compositions of
such composers as Dvořák, Vaughan Williams, and
Bartok).
However, the idea of folk culture was also taken
up by Marxists, in the construction of workingclass consciousness (“the folk,” it should be
noted, describes only serfs and peasants; members
of any ruling class are, by definition, excluded).
On the one hand, “the folk” defined the continuity of proletarian culture (as people moved
from the countryside to the city); on the other
hand, folk culture could be presented as the
“pure” form of working-class culture, untouched
by the seductions of commerce (or amplification). These arguments were developed by the
Communist Party in both the United States and
Britain in the 1930s (as part of the Popular Front
strategy), and continued to be influential in the
Ideology of folk music in the postwar period (they
had a strong influence on the ideology of rock,
for instance).

`foregrounding 
A term that originated in
Russian Formalism, where it was used to indicate an interdependence between Subjects and
objects. The formalists maintained that while
perceiving an object or an artifact, the subject
“foregrounds” some of its properties and “suppresses” others. This concept was later developed
in Czech Structuralism by Mukarovsky and
Jakobson. Mukarovsky saw “maximum foregrounding of the utterance” as one of the most
important functions of poetic language. Jakobson
(1990b) took the idea of “foregrounding utterance”
a step further in his “Linguistic and poetics”
where he argues that the structural aspect of
literary expression can easily be accommodated
within the Semiotic concept of encoded
communication.

`formalism 
An aesthetic tendency characterized by the separation of form and content in
works of Art and literature in which the predominant significance is given to formal aspects.
Although, as a tendency, formalism was always
a part of world art and literature, its emergence
as a definite trend is usually dated to the end of

the nineteenth century, when formalism receives
its theoretical foundation in the musicology of
E. Hanslick and the art criticism of Heinrich
Wölfflin. It achieves its classic form and acquires
its name in the “Formal school” of Russian literary criticism during the 1920s. Hanslick maintained that music has no content apart from its
medium. The focus of Wölfflin’s investigation
was the detection of the visual laws of organization of artistic form. He based his formalist
typological method on the notion of the development of the art of painting as an evolution of visual
forms. The next step in the early development
of formalism was taken by Oskar Walzel in his
comparative studies of works of painting, music,
and literature. Walzel based his approach on
studies of the inner laws of art works. The ideas
of early formalism found their practical implementation in the works of European Symbolists,
based on the principles of Alienation of Art
from reality (“Art is Free, Life is Paralyzed” proclaimed members of the Russian World of Art
movement) and of art for art’s sake. The philosophical foundations of the formalism of the
symbolists were built on the ideas of subjective
idealism (Neo-Kantians, Nietzsche, Bergson).
From the point of view of the adherents of formalism, the goal of art is to represent reality as
a perception or a vision and not as a recognition or an understanding. The cognitive aspect
of art was minimized and the subjective factor
became predominant. As one of the members
of Russian formalism, B. Engelgardt, wrote in his
book Formal Method in the History of Literature
(Leningrad, 1927), the unique language of individual form transmits the subjective, often subconscious emotions which cannot be described
through conventional forms. Therefore the
System of the expressive means predetermines
the selection and organization of the transmitted
meaning.
Formalism receives even more consistent and
complete realization in futurism. Futurists maintained that the main goal of an artist was the
creation, through experiments with verbal material,
of an artistic form which contained the immanent
semantic meaning of the resulting artwork. For
example, Russian cubo-futurists, whose works
served as analytical material for the Russian formalists of OPOYAZ and the Moscow Linguistic
Circle, tried to find the semantics of poetic language

formalism

The most common use of the idea of folk
culture today is almost certainly as a tourist
attraction, a way of signaling what makes a
country or locale different. In this sense, “folk culture” now describes ways of singing, dancing,
dressing, and, indeed, of making things, which
are artificially preserved by the state as a kind
of domesticated exotica (and as the basis of a
business in souvenirs).

formalism, Russian

by discovering the inner structure of words
and, by the analysis of new words, the meaning,
consisting of the sum total of meanings of the
word’s individual components (“self-sufficient
word”). Additionally, these formalist discoveries
resulted in the development of a new language
consisting of self-sufficient words called “beyondsense” or “transrational” language. We can say that,
starting with futurism, formalism becomes associated with modernism, sharing the inextricable
characteristics of the modernist literature: the
desire to overthrow the past and rejection of old
literature combined with invention of a new form
for the sake of invention itself.
Receiving further theoretical support in the
structuralist linguistics of Baudouin de Courtenay
and F. de Saussure, formalism continued its
life in the semantic analysis of I.A. Richards, which
combined “deep psychology” in the spirit of Freud
with abstract formal analysis. From the mid-1930s,
the New criticism in England and the United
States generated a new interest in Russian formalism, from which it borrowed the ideas of an
absolute autonomy of creative process and the
independence of an artist and his/her work from
the social historical surroundings.

fort-da game The game played by an eighteenmonth-old boy, as described by Freud (1920). The

child repeatedly throws a wooden reel out of his
cot and then retrieves it by means of the attached
piece of string, accompanying his action with
the interjections ooo (interpreted by Freud as
meaning fort, the German word for “gone”) and
da (“there”). The game staged the disappearance
and reappearance of objects within the child’s
reach, and Symbolized his triumphal achievement in allowing his mother to go away without
protesting. In the Lacanian perspective (Lacan,
1953), the alternating Fort! Da! are interpreted in
linguistic terms as differential phonemes; their
manipulation by the child therefore prefigures the
use of a diacritical linguistic system.

`Foucault, Michel (1926–84) 
French philosopher, historian, social analyst. Influences include
the philosophical works of Nietzsche and
Heidegger, the writings of Bataille and
Blanchot, the example of Dumézil, Canguilhem,
and Hyppolite, and more generally the tradition
of critical thought which runs from the work of
Hegel through to the analyses of the Frankfurt
school (Foucault, 1971; 1977; 1986). Foucault’s
wide-ranging analyses do not fit easily into
existing disciplinary categories. His ideas and
investigations have had a significant impact on
a number of different fields of inquiry, ranging
from philosophy, history, sociology, and political
science to literary and Cultural studies.
Foucault’s several analyses are clustered around
three sets of concerns, namely (i) the formation
and transformation of Systems of knowledge, and
the constitution of regimes of truth; (ii) technologies of the self, and (iii) the constitution of forms
of subjectivity. The analyses conducted by Foucault
range over a series of topics, including mental
illness/madness (Mental Illness and Psychology
and Madness and Civilization); medical perception
(The Birth of The Clinic); the formation of the
modern human sciences and the analysis of systems of knowledge (The Order of Things and The
Archaeology of Knowledge); discipline, punishment, and the prison (Discipline and Punish); and

281
remarked in an interview, “I do not understand
what kind of problem is common to the people
we call postmodern or post-structuralist” (Raulet,
1983, p. 205).
Less controversial is the evidence of a relative
shift of emphasis in Foucault’s work away from
the archaeological form of inquiry exemplified
by the earlier studies of reason and unreason,
the medical gaze and formation of the clinic, and
the emergence of the modern epistemological
configuration and with it the human sciences,
to the genealogical investigations of the later
works on power–knowledge relations, governmental technologies, sexuality, and subjectivity.
The implication here is not of a methodological
break, but rather of a displacement of archaeological analysis. Archaeology did not disappear
from Foucault’s work when emphasis began to be
placed on relations of power and knowledge; it
continued to serve as an appropriate methodology for the analysis of “local discursivities” in a
manner complementary to genealogy (Foucault,
1980).
In the course of his intellectual practices
Foucault sought to generate a very different conception of the role of the intellectual, one that contrasts starkly with the universalizing, legislative
pretensions of the conventional modern intellectual. For Foucault the aim of intellectual activity
was not to answer the question, “What is to be
done?” The function of the intellectual and of
knowledge in general was not considered to be
“to tell us what is good,” but rather to provide
an analysis of an event or situation “in its various complexities, with the goal of allowing refusal,
and curiosity, and innovation” (Foucault, 1988a,
p. 13). To that extent Foucault offers a different
model of the intellectual as a critical interpreter,
and his work presents a radically different critical
history of thought.
To those accustomed to turning to the Writings of intellectuals for solutions, Foucault
represents an enigma. In Foucault’s work it is
not solutions or advice that one finds but “how
and why certain things (behaviour, phenomena,
processes) became a problem” (Foucault, 1988b,
p. 16). The emphasis is placed on how and why
particular forms of behavior came to be characterized, classified, analyzed, and treated – in
short, problematized – as, for example, “madness,”
“crime,” “sexuality,” and so on. In this way

Foucault, Michel

sexuality and subjectivity (The History of Sexuality, 1976). In addition to the studies identified
above, there are numerous papers and interviews
on related themes, as well as other essays on
literature, including a monograph on the work
of Raymond Roussel, Death and the Labyrinth, of
which Foucault remarked, “I would go so far as
to say that it doesn’t have a place in the sequence
of my books. . . . No one has paid much attention
to this book, and I’m glad” (1987, p. 185). Coming from the analyst who has approached the
question of the “ ‘author’ as a function of discourse”
(Foucault, 1977, p. 124), such a remark constitutes a virtual provocation, an incitement to pay
attention to the Text in question.
Foucault was a member of a generation of
postwar French students who found the existing parameters of intellectual inquiry, namely
Marxism, Phenomenology, and Existentialism, limited and inappropriate for the subjects
in which he was interested. His various studies of
formations of domains of knowledge and their
consequences; relations of power and techniques
of government exercised over individuals; and
modes of relation to the self, represent a break with
and constitute a challenge to approaches derived
from Marxism, phenomenology, and existentialism (Smart, 1983).
Situating Foucault’s work is not easy; it crosses
and challenges disciplinary territories and it
does not readily fit into conventional analytical
categories. Foucault’s analyses clearly cannot
be accommodated within the perspectives of
Marxism, phenomenology, or existentialism, but
identifying a positive location for the various
analyses is more difficult. The work has been
described as beyond both Hermeneutics and
Structuralism, and more positively, by virtue
of a complex and changing combination of
archaeological and genealogical approaches, as
exemplifying an “interpretive analytics” (Dreyfus
and Rabinow, 1982). Other analysts have located
Foucault’s work within an opaque constellation
of approaches known as “Post-structuralism”
(Dews, 1987). Finally, some have identified
Foucault as an exponent of what has come to
be known as “Postmodernism” (Hoy, 1988).
The classification of Foucault’s work as “poststructuralist” and/or “postmodern” remains
controversial, for the terms in question do not
have a well-defined referent. As Foucault once

Fowler, Roger

282
Foucault (1988c) sought to question and erode
“self-evidentnesses and common-places,” to contribute to the transformation of “ways of perceiving
and doing things,” and to draw attention to the
possibility of new forms of subjectivity.
Two remarks, one from a friend and colleague,
the other from his principal intellectual adversary,
provide a measure of Foucault’s significance.
The French historian Paul Veyne, a friend and
colleague, commented shortly after Foucault’s
death: “[his] work seems to me to be the most
important event of thought in our century”
(quoted in Eribon, 1922, p. 328). From a radically
different and, for the most part, critical perspective, the German sociologist Jürgen Habermas
remarked: “Within the circle of philosophers of
my generation who diagnose our time, Foucault
has most lastingly influenced the Zeitgeist” (1986,
p. 107). Without doubt Michel Foucault is one
of the major figures in twentieth-century thought,
and his work will continue to exert a profound
and beneficial influence across a number of disciplines and fields of inquiry.

`Frank, Manfred (1945–) 
German philosopher and literary critic; professor of philosophy
at the University of Tübingen. Frank’s extensive
writings, which address topics ranging from the
Aesthetics and philosophy of early German
Romanticism to the contemporary debate between
Hermeneutics and (post)Structuralism, are
unified by a common thread: the attempt to
vindicate the notion of the human Subject by
appealing to the hermeneutic conception of selfhood developed in early Romantic philosophy and
poetry.
Frank seeks to vindicate the notion of the subject by showing that it need not be conceived in
terms of autonomous self-grounding and pure selfreflexivity, as it had been conceived by thinkers
like Kant. Instead, Frank demonstrates, already
in early Romanticism philosophy and Poetry
had conceived and concretized the subject as a
continuing process of interpretive individuation.
This is the occasion for Frank’s intensive focus
on the Romantic era and its distinctive notion of
temporality. Frank argues that a consistent conception of temporality underlies both philosophy
and poetry in early German Romanticism, and
through an appeal to specific authors of the period
he shows how philosophy seized upon this notion
and how poetry concretized it through language.
Frank exhibits the idea of the temporality of

283
able to transcend the (structural) conditions of
meaning production toward increasingly adequate
self-understanding.
Through this appeal to Schleiermacher, Frank
seeks to overcome the commitment of Deconstruction to the death of the subject, by
rethinking the notions of subject and individual
in a hermeneutically enlightened manner. Frank
turns to the domain of prereflective experience
as the basis for explaining consciousness and
meaning, and he rightly sees that the notion of
individual, prereflective “acquaintance of consciousness with itself” is irretrievably lost in
both structuralism and the poststructuralism of
thinkers like Derrida. Frank’s conception of
individuality acknowledges the limits of selfconsciousness while promising to elucidate both
the struggle of individual human beings to relate
to one another and the struggle of individual
interpreters to appreciate the stylistic uniqueness
of individual literary Texts. The individual is
neither its own author nor the source of structure
or order; instead, as a constant threat to orderings, the individual plays an irreducible role in the
constitution of meaning. What Frank ultimately
seeks is a hermeneutic model of subjectivity as
individuality, in which structuralist Semiotics is
employed to inform hermeneutics so that hermeneutics need not fall prey to the anti-rationalism
of Heidegger’s Existentialism.
One aim here is to accommodate semiotic and
deconstructive interpretations of texts within an
essentially hermeneutic model, in effect rejecting
the poststructuralists’ radical claim that meaning
is ultimately undecidable. Frank’s hermeneutic
approach invokes Heidegger’s notion of ek-static
projection and Gadamer’s hermeneutic notion
of dialogue with tradition, though Frank’s
defense of subjectivity is ultimately stronger than
Gadamer’s. Frank refers to this hermeneutic
modification of poststructuralism as “neostructuralism:” the constitution of meaning requires
both “differance” or “differentiality” and subjectivity conceived as individuality. Without the
individuality-pole of this relation, Frank argues,
there can be no meaning-events.
One application of this modification is Frank’s
passing critique of the political implications of
post-structuralism, which amount to indifference
masquerading as the quest for liberation from
oppressive structures. In particular, Frank exhibits

Frank, Manfred

self-consciousness through an examination of
the philosophies of Schlegel, Solger, and Novalis,
and he demonstrates that these thinkers share a
concept of temporality which anticipates Henry
James’s notion of “stream of consciousness” as well
as the reflections on internal time consciousness
conducted by Bergson and Husserl. The problem
of ultimate grounding in German idealism leads
back not to substantiality or pure self-reflection,
but rather to an idea of temporal flux in which
the present is forged out of “remembrance”
oriented on the past and “longing” oriented on
the future; the subject is conceived not as selfgrounding, but rather as grounded in an experience
of something beyond itself. To this extent Frank
shows early Romanticism to be incompatible
with the idealist Fichte’s attempt to invoke a
transcendental self-grounding of the subject as
the fundamental principle of all philosophizing.
Frank invokes Schlegel’s notion of time as “longing for the infinite” and Novalis’s conception
of human reality as an insubstantial “not-beingsomething,” conceptions which challenge the
conventional wisdom that modern German philosophy is without exception based on presence.
Frank draws an essential link in this connection
between Novalis and the thought of Schlegel,
Solger, and Hardenberg; and he argues that this
philosophical conception of selfhood as a cipher
finds poetic expression in early Romanticism,
above all in Ludwig Tieck’s early poetry as well
as in his theoretical treatises.
Frank develops this conception of the self by
turning to Schleiermacher’s Hermeneutics as
a crucial if forgotten set of reflections on the
notion of the subject, reflections which promise
to help overcome the “conflict of interpretations”
which Ricoeur sees between structuralism and
hermeneutics. Rather than taking the subject as
a fixed starting point, Schleiermacher takes it as
a focal point for questioning and self-reflection;
Frank believes that, by proceeding from such a
conception, it should be possible to balance the

`Frankfurt school 
What is now known as the
Frankfurt school of Critical theory began in
1930 with Max Horkheimer’s directorship of the
Frankfurt Institute of Social Research, to which
he gave a new and specific direction. In is inaugural address (Horkheimer, 1968) he announced
the importance of launching a systematic, interdisciplinary program in critical theory that
would combine methods of scientific research
with a Marxist theory of society. As this program
developed during the next decade with Horkheimer’s collaboration with Herbert Marcuse,
Theodor W. Adorno, and Erich Fromm, two
important revisions of Marx resulted. First,
critical theory reached out to embrace new
developments in Psychoanalysis, as Marcuse and
Fromm especially labored to produce a synthesis
of Marx and Freud. Second, Horkheimer and
Marcuse became convinced that the proletariat
had become so much a part of the capitalist
system that it had lost its potential for revolutionary social change. By the end of the decade,
however, with the rise of fascism and Stalinism,
their confidence that intellectual reflection could
become an effective, progressive substitute for
proletarian revolution began to wane and to be

replaced by Negative dialectics, which questioned
the Enlightenment ideal of political change
brought about by rational processes. Horkheimer
and Adorno’s The Dialectic of Enlightenment
(1947), a complex text that was largely written
during the early 1940s, is an important statement of this disillusioned position, especially
in its skepticism about the possibility of social
change resulting from scientific research. As an
institution, the Frankfurt school, as it was during its first phase, began to break up soon after
it began. Adorno left Germany in 1934, and
throughout the 1940s the school was in exile in
New York, where new and alternative theories were
developed. The school reopened in Frankfurt in
1950, and Adorno became its director in 1958.
Jürgen Habermas’s critique of The Dialectic of
Enlightenment (Habermas, 1985) and the development of his theory of Communicative action
have opened up important new directions for
critical theory.

`Frege, Gottlob (1848–1925) 
German philosopher of logic, mathematics, and language,
known chiefly for his work in refining and
extending the scope of Symbolic logic with the
introduction of quantifiers and other technical
devices. Frege’s contribution in this field is
esteemed by some – Michael Dummett prominent
among them – as the greatest since Aristotle and
the source of all the most important developments
in recent analytic philosophy. Less successful was
Frege’s early attempt to establish the foundations of mathematics on a purely logical basis, an

285
proposition, that is, one in which the subject
and predicate refer to the same item (the planet
Venus), and whose truth is therefore a matter of
logical necessity devoid of material or substantive
content. But, as Frege points out, we could in
fact learn something from the above sentence
if we happened not to know already that those
two expressions (“the Morning Star” and “the
Evening Star”) referred to the same celestial
body. What we learn is that they both designate
the same referent even though their senses – the
meanings they possessed within our previous
descriptive language – appeared to pick out different objects. Frege also offers the example of two
explorers approaching a mountain from opposite
sides – and from different linguistic communities
– only to discover that they had each been applying their own name to what they thought were
separate features of the landscape, but what in fact
turned out to be the selfsame mountain (or referent) under two distinct senses or descriptions.
These cases may appear somewhat strained
or artificial. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that
discoveries and truth claims in science very often
take the form of propositions that are now (once
securely established) on the face of it tautologous
but which at first conveyed a novel and informative
truth about the structure of physical reality.
Thus for instance: “water is H2O,” “heat is the
mean kinetic energy of molecules,” “e = mc2,”
“blueness is the property of reflecting light of
wavelength 4400 Å,” etc. These would all have to
be seen as strictly tautologous (noninformative)
statements were it not for our grasp of the sense/
reference distinction, that is, the fact that although
each pair of terms designates an identical referent, it does so through the conjunction of two
distinct senses which serve to communicate a
genuine (nonself-evident) item of scientific knowledge. Again, Russell arrives at a similar conclusion
by applying his “theory of descriptions.” A case
in point would be the sentence “Scott was the
author of Waverley,” a fact which apparently
came as news to King George IV.
Such arguments have played a large part in
Anglo-American analytic philosophy since the
early years of this century. They operate on the
premise that everyday (natural) language may
often give rise to error – or to “systematically
misleading” forms of expression – owing to
its failure to articulate logical distinctions with

Frege, Gottlob

enterprise that foundered (as he came to believe)
on certain intractable paradoxes in set theory discovered and brought to his attention by Bertrand
Russell.
Most important for critical and cultural theorists is Frege’s cardinal distinction between
“sense” and “reference.” These are the standard
– though not altogether satisfactory – translations
of the German words Sinn and Bedeutung. The
“sense” of a term is its meaning as defined by the
role it plays, or the semantic attributes it possesses,
in some given natural language. The “referent”
of that term is the object which it designates or
the real-world entity which it serves to pick out
when properly deployed. Thus there exist some
names of (for example) fictive or hypothetical
objects, characters or events which may be said
to possess sense but not reference. That is, we
can assert a great many things about the persons
encountered – or the actions narrated – in
fictional Texts since those texts themselves provide all the relevant information. But we are not
thereby committed to the belief that, in order
for our statements to be meaningful, they must
have reference to some actually existing (or historically attested) entity of which they can then
be determinately true or false.
This was how Frege sought to resolve certain
longstanding problems in the area of logic, meaning, and truth. His argument finds a close parallel
in Russell’s “theory of descriptions,” likewise
intended to remove the anomaly of sentences –
such as “the present King of France is bald” –
which would appear to be neither true nor false
since they lack any object (any real-world referent) to which those values might apply. Russell’s
solution was to analyze the sentence into its
underlying logical (as opposed to its surface and
misleading grammatical) form. It would then
read: “there is one and only one person reigning
over France, and there is no one reigning over
France who is not bald.” In this case the sentence
would be manifestly false in respect of its initial
premise.
Another main purpose of Frege’s sense/
reference distinction was to explain how certain
seemingly redundant or tautologous sentences
– such as “the Morning Star is [identical to] the
Evening Star” – may none the less serve to communicate items of factual or informative knowledge. On the face of it this is a purely analytic

Freud, Sigmund

286
sufficient clarity or rigor. This idea was rejected
by J.L. Austin and exponents of the “ordinary
language” approach that dominated Oxford philosophy during the 1950s and 1960s. In their
view – also much influenced by Wittgenstein
– it was altogether wrong to suppose that language
stood in need of such logical regimentation, or
that mere “analysis” could somehow uncover
truths more important than the great stock of
wisdom enshrined in the nuances, distinctions, and
subtleties of usage to be gleaned from our everyday habits of talk. Hence what Richard Rorty and
others have noted as an emergent split or parting of the ways within the broad camp of so-called
linguistic philosophy.
Poststructuralism is another (albeit very
different) school of thought which has pursued
its own path to some highly dubious doctrines –
for example, the “arbitrary” nature of the sign, the
infinitized “freeplay” of meaning, the linguistic (or
discursive) construction of reality, etc. – without
paying heed to Frege’s sense/reference distinction. Had it done so then we might have been
spared much confusion, especially with regard
to Saussure’s idea of the two-term relation
between signifier and signified. This is taken by
poststructuralists to entail nothing less than a
wholesale ban – a proscriptive veto – on any appeal
to the referent as the third term in the Semiotic
triangle. In fact this approach was adopted by
Saussure as a purely heuristic or methodological
convenience for analyzing language in its structural–synchronic aspect. He never once claimed
– and indeed quite expressly denied – that language could communicate or its workings be
adequately explained in the absence of the referential function. Nothing could more clearly
illustrate the misunderstandings that have come
about through poststructuralism’s stance of selfimposed isolation from other, more cogent and
philosophically informed traditions of thought.

`Freud, Sigmund (1856–1939) 
The founder
of psychoanalysis was born in Freiberg (Moravia)
into a rather poor Jewish family. In 1860 the
family moved to Vienna, which was to be Freud’s
home until 1938, when the Nazi invasion of
Austria forced him into exile in London.
Ambitious and successful at school, Freud
entered medical school in 1873 but did not
graduate as a doctor of medicine until 1881.
Freud’s initial research and publications were
on anatomy and physiology, and the significant
turning point came in 1885–6 when a travel
bursary allowed him to study under Charcot at
the Salpêtrière in Paris. He was particularly struck
by the evidence for the existence of hysteria in
men as well as in women, and by the manner
in which Charcot could reproduce his patients’
hysterical symptoms by posthypnotic suggestion.
On his return to Vienna, Freud set up in private
practice as a specialist in nervous diseases. From
this point onwards, his biography is synomymous with the history of Psychoanalysis.
Between 1887 and 1904 Freud corresponded at
length with Wilhelm Fliess, a German ear, nose,
and throat specialist who was preoccupied with
establishing the existence of a male sexual periodicity analogous to the menstrual cycle and with
a hypothetical nasal reflex neurosis predicated
upon a link between the nose and the genitals.
Despite the bizarre nature of his theories, Fliess
served as a sounding board for Freud, who began
to elaborate his own theories and, although not
intended for publication, the letters provide a
unique account of the origins of psychoanalysis
(Freud, 1985). The correspondence also represents
the beginning of a characteristic pattern. The
lengthy relationship with a male colleague gave
way to a period of estrangement in which theoretical and personal differences overlapped, and
eventually to hostility. Freud’s relationships with
Breuer, with whom he collaborated on a series
of studies of hysteria in female patients (Breuer
and Freud, 1893–5), and subsequently with Jung,
were to follow the same pattern (see Freud, 1974).
It was during the period of the correspondence
with Fliess and in his collaborative work with
Breuer that Freud began to develop his theory concerning the origins of hysteria. According to the
so-called seduction theory, hysteria is a form of
neurosis that results from a repressed memory of
a sexual trauma (rape, sexual abuse) in childhood.

287
hand on the forehead of the patient proved
sufficient to convince the latter that the traumatic memory could be recovered. The patient was
encouraged to evoke and relive the traumatic
event and to “abreact” it in a kind of verbal
purgation. The cathartic method was in its turn
abandoned in favor of free association, which
has since become the basis of all psychoanalytic
treatment. The analysand is required to say what
he or she thinks or feels, selecting nothing and
omitting nothing. A similar fundamental rule
applies to the analyst, who must listen with poised
or evenly suspended attention, giving no importance to any particular aspect of what is being
said so as to allow his own unconscious to work.
Significantly, Freud did not take notes for fear
of allowing his attention to be either distracted
or too concentrated. The analytic setting is the
locus for the emergence of the all-important
phenomenon of Transference.
Freud’s first great work was The Interpretation
of Dreams (Freud, 1900), which provides perhaps
the most lucid, and certainly the most attractively
readable introduction to his theory of the Unconscious and to its workings (see Dream-work;
Condensation/displacement). It and the
closely related Psychopathology of Everyday Life
(1901) provide the evidence that neurotic behavior, in attentuated form, is observable in all
human beings and that its manifestations indicate the universality of the unconscious. On the
basis of these investigations and his case studies,
Freud elaborated his first topography or model
for the understanding of the psyche. This model
centers upon the topographical distinction
between the unconscious and preconsciousconscious systems.
The psychoanalytic discovery of the unconscious was complemented in the early 1900s by
the elaboration of a theory of sexual development
(Freud, 1905). Elements of such a theory can be
found in the correspondence with Fliess, in early
papers, and in the studies of hysteria. However,
Freud’s first coherent account of psychosexual
development is to be found in the three essays
of 1905, which underwent constant revision and
expansion until the third and final edition of
1926 (Freud, 1905). Although the essays do have
something in common with the work of sexologists like Kraft-Ebbing and Havelock Ellis, they also
offer a full account of human development, and

Freud, Sigmund

The memory of the trauma is repressed, but is then
reactivated, with pathological effects, at puberty.
Freud (1896) was convinced that all cases of
hysteria could be traced back to such an event.
This first scenario implied the traumatic irruption
of adult sexuality into the life of a passive and
asexual child. Puzzled by the improbably high
incidence of incest in accounts given by patients,
Freud was finally forced to admit to Fliess that
he no longer believed in his own theory of the
etiology of hysteria (1985, p. 264).
The seduction theory was gradually replaced
with other theories generated by the discovery
of a spontaneous infantile sexuality, which indicated that no external stimulus is necessary for the
child to develop sexual theories and fantasies.
The final outcome was the theory of the Oedipus
complex, according to which the scene of seduction results from the incestuous wishes of the child
rather than the aggression of the parent. Freud’s
rejection of the seduction theory has occasioned
much controversy and even the accusation that
he abandoned a “true” theory in order to silence
women and children (Masson, 1984). The claim
is exaggerated, and Freud did not lose sight of the
reality of the sexual abuse of children. In his last
unfinished exposition of psychoanalytic theory, he
refers to it as being common enough and does not
deny that it has traumatic effects (Freud, 1938).
Its incidence is not, however, enough to explain
the universal existence of Oedipal ambivalence.
Throughout the period of his correspondence
with Fliess and his collaboration with Breuer,
Freud suffered from a variety of psychosomatic
complaints which he sought to remedy through
a difficult process of self-analysis. The selfanalysis is never described by Freud in any
detail, but it is the subject of many passing
allusions, notably in The Interpretation of
Dreams (Freud, 1900; see Anzieu, 1975). Freud’s
early experience of working with neurosis and
his own self-analysis were the factors that led
to the slow emergence of the classic form of a
therapeutic method designed, in Freud’s words,
to transform “hysterical misery into common
unhappiness” (Breuer and Freud, 1893–5, p. 305).
Inspired by Charcot, Freud initially used
hypnosis as a means of removing repression, but
soon abandoned that method in favor of what
he described as the cathartic method. Suggestion
replaced full hynosis; the pressure of the analyst’s

Freud, Sigmund

establish that perversion is part of a continuum
with normal behavior and not evidence of
depravity or degeneracy. One of the striking
features of the three essays is Freud’s ability to
combine a high degree of nonjudgmental tolerance in his discussions of perversion with the belief
that genital heterosexuality is the final goal of
healthy sexual development.
Sexuality itself is no longer equated with genitality and is extended to include all activities
and pleasures which are not explicable in terms
of biological or functional need. The relationship between the two is exemplified in Freud’s
exploration of infantile sexuality and particularly
the oral stage. Thumb sucking and related forms
of auto-erotism represent a recovery of the pleasure of sucking at the breast, with the desire for
sexual pleasure gradually becoming separated
from the satisfaction of the biological need for
nutrition.
More generally, Freud proposes a series of stages
in psychosexual development, each typified by
the primacy of a specific erotic zone and by
characteristic forms of Object-relations. The
primacy of the genital zone is not pregiven and
is only established by the organization of the
libido or sexual instinct; libido is distinguished
from the self-preservation instincts predicated
upon the biological needs. The earliest stage is
described as being oral: the experience of pleasure
is bound up with the lips and with the act of sucking, and the very young child relates to its object
(primarily the mother) in terms of eating and being
eaten. The emergence of the anal stage represents
a major advance in both motor control and
intellectual development. Feces, for instance,
can be given a Symbolic meaning and become a
gift to be offered or retained. In the final genital
stage, the sexual instinct becomes subordinate
to reproductive functions and all other zones are
subordinated to the genital zone.
The child who figures in Freud’s account is
invariably a boy, and it is clear that he has
difficulty in supplying a comparable account
of the development of girls (see in particular the
chapter on “Femininity” in Freud, 1933). Its introduction required the introduction of a phallic stage,
a key development in Freud’s theorization of the
Oedipus complex, and the thesis that both boys
and girls believe that sexual difference results
from castration. Notoriously, female sexuality

itself remained a “dark continent” (Freud, 1926,
p. 212), and the relationship between psychoanalysis and feminism has therefore always been
a fraught one (see Femininity; Lacan, Jacques;
Mitchell, Juliet; Phallus).
Freud’s first topography remained almost unaltered until 1920, when he modified it considerably by introducing the notion of a death drive
(Freud, 1920). Its introduction was in part an
attempt on Freud’s part to explain the existence
of phenomena such as repetition and the conservative nature of instinctual life, which cannot
be explained in terms of a search for libidinal
satisfaction. The pleasure principle itself refers
to the psyche’s need to reduce levels of Tension
or excitation, pleasure itself being the release
of tension. Freud now began to speculate about
a desire to reduce tension to zero, to return to
an inorganic state. The existence of something
beyond the pleasure principle could, in Freud’s
view, explain sadistic phenomena and the
Paradox whereby death can be described as the
goal of life. The death drive is part of a dualistic
theory, and the opposite pole to the life instincts;
the two poles are often referred to as Thanatos
and Eros respectively. The death drive is perhaps
the most cotroversial aspect of Freudian theory;
it is really only Klein who takes it on board in
its full implications.
At the same time, Freud was also revising the
very foundations of his work by introducing a
second or structural topography which differentiates between the three agencies of id, ego, and
superego (Freud, 1923). The id represents the
instinctual pole of the personality, and its contents
are the expression of the activity of the drives. The
superego acts as a censor or judge supervising the
ego and originates from the internalization of
parental prohibitions and images of authority.
The ego itself is the most difficult of the agencies
to describe. The term (Ich) has a philosophical
ancestry and is used in some of Freud’s earliest
Writings. Although it can be described as the
“surface” of the psyche, the ego is not entirely
synonymous with conscious subjectivity, and
some of its elements are held to be unconscious.
It is, on the other hand, the agency responsible
for rational thought, reality testing, defenses
against instinctual demands, and the object of
prohibitions fom the superego (see the article
entitled “Ego” in Laplanche and Pontalis, 1967).

Canadian critic
and literary theorist. Frye graduated from Victoria
College, University of Toronto, and Merton
College, Oxford. For most of his professional
life he taught at Victoria College. One of the
most influential literary theorists of the twentieth
century, Frye has been most often associated
with myth or archetypal criticism, although he
disliked labels and denied having founded a
school.
His first book, Fearful Symmetry: A Study
of William Blake (1947), revolutionized Blake
studies and demonstrated, for the first time,
Frye’s synoptic approach to literature. The book
constituted a challenge to those critics who had
neglected or despised Blake’s long prophetic works
in favor of the more comprehensible and frequently anthologized Songs. Frye sought to demonstrate the total coherence of Blake’s work, often
standing back from the details of the poems

Frye, Northrop

After 1925 no further major theoretical innovations were made and the last period of Freud’s
life was largely devoted to the writing of the
wide-ranging and speculative essays on art and
civilization (see Psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism), which undertake psychoanalytic investigations into the origins of religion
and morality (Freud, 1930), culminating in the
final study of Moses (Freud, 1939). The essays are
generally pessimistic, seeing civilization as based
upon repression and constantly threatened by
the instinctual.

in order to reveal the underlying Structure
or myth that makes sense of the whole.
Such a critical practice was a direct challenge
to New Criticism, and Frye’s next book, Anatomy
of Criticism: Four Essays (1957), extended the
methodology to the whole tradition of Western
literature and Literary Criticism. This ambitious
undertaking, carried out with encyclopedic virtuosity, established Frye as one of the most exciting
critics of his generation. Deploring the lack of
theoretical rigor and appropriate vocabulary in the
profession, Frye sets out to provide a technical
vocabulary and a synoptic view of the whole of
criticism (and by implication of the whole of
literature) that will establish a scientific basis for
literary studies. He assumes that “just as there is
an order of nature behind the natural sciences, so
literature is not a piled aggregate of ‘works,’ but
an order of words” (Frye, 1957). He perceives that
order operating at four different levels of criticism:
(i) historical, a theory of modes, derived in
large part from Aristotle; (ii) ethical, a theory of
Symbols in four phases (literal, formal, mythical,
and anagogic); (iii) archetypal, a theory of
myths; and (iv) rhetorical, a theory of genres. The
most influential has been his theory of myths, or
archetypal criticism. Whereas Formalism had
assumed a total form for the individual literary
work, archetypal criticism assumes a total form
for literature as a whole, which moves from the
apocalyptic at one extreme to the demonic at the
other, from heaven to hell. Further classification
reveals four structuring myths or pregeneric
categories, corresponding to the four seasons:
Comedy (the mythos of spring); romance (the
mythos of summer); Tragedy (the mythos of
autumn); and Irony or satire (the mythos of
winter). Moreover, within each mythos Frye
recognizes six phases. These theories were developed and applied in studies on an extraordinary
range of writers and works, including Shakespeare, Milton, English Romanticism, T.S. Eliot,
Canadian literature, and the Bible.
Frye’s work has provoked extreme reactions,
ranging from adulation to hostility. He combines encyclopedic scholarship with daring theoretical speculation; an Aristotelian passion for
classification with a Blakean vision; wit and humor
with deep seriousness. He is a humanist critic in
the line of Matthew Arnold, but he revived and
renovated the biblical exegesis of the medieval

schoolmen. Paradoxical and polemical, he is
assured of a permanent place in the history of
literary theory.

`Fugitives 
A group of American poets and
critics. The group was based at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and published
The Fugitive, a bimonthly magazine of poetry
and critical essays, from 1922 until 1925. John
Crowe Ransom was the dominant figure and
the Fugitives’ positions are epitomized in his
“Thoughts on the poetic discontent” (1925), an
attack on Romanticism and a defense of “the
wisdom of irony” which prefigures the central preoccupations of New Criticism. The Fugitives
were bitterly opposed to the scientific and technological tendencies of modern civilization, and
(as their name suggests) pictured themselves as
fighting a lonely defensive struggle against it.
After the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, when a
schoolteacher was convicted of teaching Darwinism in a Tennessee school, the Fugitives turned
more and more to a political and cultural defense
of the values of the Old South. The group broke
up in the mid-1920s as its leaders became more
and more preoccupied with economic and political issues, and was subsumed into the Southern
Agrarians.

aligned with the useful arts, and its architects are
inspired by buildings of vernacular traditions,
such as barns and farmhouses; in the second
phase architecture is understood as a science,
and its architects seek out the work of engineers
for ideas, such as bridges and factories. Both
phases of functionalism, then, look to utilitarian
structures, and both find there an absence of
unnecessary decoration. So functionalists also
strive in their work for a clean, uncluttered
appearance, and they sometimes create buildings
in which the order and clarity of the artistic
statement seems to take precedence over the
practical.

`functionalism 
The practical and artistic are
interwined in the creation of architecture, but the
belief about architecture promoted in functionalism is that the practical (how well a building is
constructed and works) takes precedence over
the artistic (how beautiful or delightful to experience a building is). Functionalism appears in two
overlapping phases in the late nineteenth century:
the first holds simply that the artistic is secondary to the practical, and the second – a more
extreme position – denys that the artistic is
important at all. In the first phase it is argued that
if a building is responsive to structural requirements and the needs of its occupants, its artistic
character will emerge on its own. This is the view
that is suggested by Louis Sullivan’s statement,
“form follows function.” In the second phase, the
sole measure of a structure is how fit it is to fulfill
its use. This view is captured in Le Corbusier’s
statement: “a house is a machine to live in.” In
the first phase of functionalism architecture is

`Gadamer, Hans-Georg (1900–2002) 
German
philosopher. He was a pupil and friend of
Heidegger. His project is known as philosophical
Hermeneutics, which, following Heidegger’s
theme of the interpretative character of Dasein,
shows that the mode of our whole human experience in the world is hermeneutic, always occupied
with interpretation and understanding. Language
receives a prominent position not only as underlying all understanding, but also as providing the
fundamental dimension of hermeneutics, the
infinite dialog we are. Philosophical hermeneutics,
enhanced with the Aristotelian conception of
practical wisdom, can inform our daily praxis,
and thus serve as practical (moral) philosophy.
Although Gadamer was a leading philosopher
in Germany, his influence and popularity in the
English-speaking countries have only recently
become apparent, mainly owing to the extensive
attention paid to his major work Truth and
Method, published in 1960. His hermeneutics
has shown itself to be closely related to almost every
other discipline in the humanities, the social and
historical sciences, Literary criticism, and aesthetic theory, where the notions of interpretation
and understanding are constantly at stake.
Gadamer, in his Truth and Method, pursued the
recovery of “truth” and knowledge in areas beyond
the control of scientific method. In the experience
of Art, philosophy, and literature, truth is communicated that cannot be verified or approached
by the methodical means available to the (natural)

sciences. The human sciences (social, political, historical disciplines, including economics, psychology, archaeology, etc.) can also mediate truth,
if properly attained by overcoming their naive
methodical approaches. Based on the experience
of retrieving truth embedded in history and
Culture, Gadamer structures a new notion of
understanding. In accordance with Heidegger,
understanding is shown to be a universal mode
of existence ascribed to the human agent. It
establishes our ontological disposition in the
world as interpretative beings.
Nevertheless, truth in art is not easily accessible. It is blocked by the Alienation of our
aesthetic consciousness. When we view a work
of art, by considering it as an object of aesthetic
judgment, we usually fail to listen to its immediate claim. This is more obvious with historical
works of art, such as the religious creations of
the Greeks, where the divine was experienced
in artistic works related to gods. Assessing these
works as objects of our aesthetic judgment, the
world of their experience is lost. For Gadamer, this
practice shows an alienation, especially when it
stops the authentic experience and the immediate truth claim of art. The task then becomes the
recovery of truth as artistic knowledge, different
of course from scientific knowledge.
A similar alienation dominates the historical
consciousness as it develops in the human sciences.
Historical science, for example, attends to only
one part of our contact with historical tradition.

293
of our attempt to understand, also making us
aware of our prejudices. It works as a filter to
separate and retain the productive prejudices,
while rejecting those which are limited, unproductive, or erroneous.
In historical studies, we cannot simply place ourselves opposite the past text and treat it as an object
of study which bears no relation to us (Historicism). In the historical gap between ourselves
and the text, the latter has released its “effects”
in history. Preunderstandings and shared knowledge usually characterize our approach. They are
the products of these effects on us. For example,
all opinions of, historical research into, and evaluations of Homer’s Iliad form its effects. The
power of “effective history” is always at work, and
serious deformation of knowledge can result if we
ignore it.
One of the most productive Gadamerian metaphors is the notion of “horizon.” This includes
what surrounds us from our particular position
in history and language. We belong to the horizon of our tradition. However, considering the
horizon of the text, as a past alien horizon, the
text cannot speak to us. The same occurs in conversation if we do not include our own horizon.
We cannot validate the other person’s claims,
since we cannot listen to him/her. Instead, we must
overcome the particularity of our own horizon and
reach a higher common ground that can sustain
both positions. This describes the fusion of horizons. In it the meeting of the present with the past
occurs, although we are aware of the tension of
the two.
Two further points underline Gadamer’s theory
of understanding. First, the horizon of the present
cannot be formed without the past, thus displaying the necessity of knowing tradition. Second,
belonging always to a tradition, we move along
with it. Therefore any act of understanding,
accepting its own historicality, must appreciate tradition. Such fusion of horizons, of the present and
the past, is part of our hermeneutical experience
of the world.
The fusion of horizons is further detailed by the
need to render the sayings of the text to our particular situation. We must apply the horizon of the
text to ourselves, and not interpret it arbitrarily.
The prime example here is legal hermeneutics,
where the judge applies (interprets) the law to suit
specific legal cases.

Gadamer, Hans-Georg

It confronts tradition as an object of study, thus
not allowing tradition to “speak to us.” The scientific practice which does not permit listening
to its truths shows, in Gadamerian thought,
an enormous alienation. Our hermeneutic consciousness (the awareness of our hermeneutic
experience) also betrays alienation. In our effort
to understand another person, if we simply
decipher the other’s statements, based on the
“I” and “thou” division, we are unable to listen
to what the other person says from within her
horizon.
There are two universal aspects of our understanding that Gadamer brings to light: its historicality (Historicity), that is, its immersion in
history and tradition, and the linguìsticality of
understanding, which shows its entanglement
within language. In order to unearth the historical dimensions of our understanding, he proceeds
to the human sciences (thus concretizing the historical situation of Dasein, a theme not developed
by Heidegger).
According to Gadamer we never understand
without prejudices (preconceptions). Even the most
familiar case of textual understanding indicates
how we begin with certain preconceptions, eventually retained or changed in the course of reading, which itself proceeds by further projections
and anticipation of meaning (seen here as the
Hermeneutic circle, which in previous hermeneutic tradition was considered as the interplay
between parts and whole, and now between prejudices and projections). Gadamer sees prejudices
to be necessary starting points to any understanding, and he undertakes the rehabilitation of
the term, which sounds negative as a result of
its treatment in the Enlightenment. The latter
believed in knowledge free from any prejudice.
According to Gadamer, the interpreter in a
reflective engagement must become aware of his
own prejudices, which are historically produced
and part of any attempt in interpreting and
understanding meaning. Thus he can avoid
gross misunderstandings.
Philosophical hermeneutics does not supply a
method of understanding; it only clarifies the
conditions which accompany any act of understanding. One of these is “temporal distance,”
which indicates the temporal gap separating us,
as interpreters, from a historical event or a past
Text. Temporal distance illustrates the historicality

Gadamer, Hans-Georg

294
Moving to the domain of language, Gadamer’s
main thesis is that “all understanding is interpretation.” This claim is crucial for his hermeneutical theory. If true, whatever the discipline,
literature, social, or natural sciences, our understanding proceeds on interpretational steps.
Translation from one language to another gives
a good example of how interpretation is achieved
as highlighting. In conversation, similarly, one tries
to understand what the other person says. An
imperceptible translation takes place, as each
participant attempts to understand the other’s
views from his/her point. Conversation entails
translation in a common language.
Gadamer’s demands on interpretation reach
their climax, and also they become more problematic, when he makes the strong claim that
linguistic interpretation is the form of all interpretation. This appears to be so when understanding the text or the words of another person.
However, what about understanding a musical
performance or someone’s gestures? Although
our experience of understanding in such cases
appears immediate or intuitive, Gadamer believes
that linguistically shaped previous experience and
knowledge accounts for our ability to understand. A soloist interpreting a piece of music
does so from previous experience, from teaching,
reflection, tradition, comparison, all linguistically achieved. Language underlies the ability
to highlight (interpret) or distinguish what is
essential. The basic assumption here is that all of
our experiences are linguistic in nature. Without
language we would never have the experience we
receive and which we can communicate. Language
constitutes the world we know.
By introducing language as the background of
any act of understanding, Gadamer shifts his
accounts of the hermeneutical act to be informed
by a philosophical view of language. As a result,
a further picture of the human position and the
world in language emerges.
Language becomes the fundamental mode of
operation in our-being-in-the-world. It becomes
the necessary condition for the world’s existence
as we know it. Unlike animals living in a habitat,
“we have world” (Welt haben), upon which we can
reflect and, with our “projective” ability, free
ourselves from it. This ontological position concerning freedom arises from the fact of having
language. But is language a prison? Gadamer’s

answer is that, since all understanding is linguistic in nature, and since language indicates the presence of reason, then from the fusion of one’s
horizon with the horizon of other traditions, or
of other persons, reason moves beyond the
boundaries of any particular language.
Important conclusions follow upon his theoretical positions on language. Our ontological
placement in language and historical tradition
entails that there is no privileged perspective. Also,
each historical time we interpret tradition, we interpret it differently. Although these views define an
antifoundationalist philosophical position, do
they invite a strong relativism? Gadamer insists
that his position does not result in absolute
relativism. The interpretations we achieve are
“objective” in the specific historical time they are
produced.
Central to his approach is the notion of truth.
Truths are transmitted in culture and history,
which our hermeneutic experience can grasp. By
the notion of truth, Gadamer does not have in
mind propositional statements which can be
verified or validated. Truth appears to coincide
with insight that has been handed down to us by
past cultures. Furthermore, as in art, a play has
an impact upon its audience, so truth, when
noticed, “makes a claim upon us.” Its presence
grasps us. The whole notion of truth (close to
the Heideggerian notion of truth as disclosure)
is impregnated with further qualifications: it
reveals aspects of Being.
There is, however, another aspect of language
which displays its ontological significance and
role beyond just a means of communication.
Being presents itself in language. The way things
present themselves in language is part of their
being. We expand our views within language,
but they are all aspects of the world. The world
is not different from the views in which it present itself (Gadamer, 1960). Language is the place
where the “I” meets the world. Although it is a
difficult view to follow, since it contradicts (objectivist) common sense, it nevertheless portrays a
very intimate relation between language and the
world. Such an approach presents a claim beyond
any other Philosophy of language.
Looking at the position of the human agent
in language, further implications are stressed.
The example of conversation becomes central
in Gadamer’s development of the notion of

295
what the text, or the other person, says. What
makes understanding possible is the forgetfulness of language, that is, of its formal elements.
He charges Derrida for one-sided attention to
the concept of Sign, rather than listening to the
word as it is employed in conversation. The
(Derridian) “difference” should be found in the
spoken word, not in the sign (Gadamer, 1989).
Gadamer has produced a number of works on
art since Truth and Method, attempting to move
away from the subordination of art to the theme
of truth in the human sciences (Bernasconi, in
Gadamer, 1986). His views are based on Heidegger’s conception of art, although he wishes to
expand it beyond “great art” and include a larger
number of art forms. As in earlier works, Gadamer
introduces the concept of mimesis, through
which we can understand modern art. If this is
so, artistic changes have not resulted in discontinuities, and contemporary art can still be
approached through tradition.
Situating us in language and historical tradition,
Gadamer has registered our concrete finitude as
interpretative but also dialogical beings, entering
communication and “agreement.” His enlarged
conception of truth gives life to the Heideggerian
“language is the house of Being.”
Underlining his achievements, we can confidently say that, besides the task of revealing
methodical alienation and pointing to truths
from tradition, he has brought to light the universal dimensions of our hermeneutical experience.
He has accomplished this, first, by presenting
a historicized ontology of Dasein, second, by
providing us with an insightful and dynamic (yet
undeveloped) theory of language, and third, by
evoking an ontological picture of Being (what it
means to be, how the world is), in which language
itself becomes the horizon of Being.
There are a number of difficult and unclear parts
in his presentation. Proper articulation of how the
world is presented in language (avoiding Platonic
associations) has yet to be achieved. The need for
further clarity on his notion of truth has already
become a pole of attraction for current research.
The work of Gadamer, created in a long and
productive life engagement, offers vast areas
of insight and subjects for further elaboration.
Although not his main target, he inescapably
provides an account of “reading the text,” an issue
at the heart of contemporary literary criticism. The

understanding. Conversation includes the specific
practice of question and answer. Every assertion
(in text or in speech) can be considered an answer
to a question. This process throws light on our
hermeneutical experience. To start a conversation, we need also to reach “agreement,” not
sharing the same ideas on the subject matter,
but establishing a common ground for the two
different positions that are heard. Conversation
here portrays vividly the exchange shaping the
dialogic relationship between ourselves, but also
the text which can be thought of as a partner in
discussion. The other person and the text also must
be allowed to pose their questions to us.
It is our presence in dialogue, where Gadamer’s
conception leads. “The dialogue we are,” as he says,
shows all the dimensions of our communal life.
His conception of dialogue is shaped upon the
familiar examples of Platonic dialogues. Dialogue
is thought of as overcoming alienation and
bringing people together. No one remains the same
in it, but one changes with questioning and
appropriating what is other. Partners in dialogue
realize some solidarity emerging (Ricoeur and
Gadamer, 1982).
The picture of philosophical hermeneutics
would be incomplete without the humanist notion
of Bildung (self-formation, cultivation). The primacy of the self-formation of the individual is prior
to any other ideal of knowledge, especially knowledge as technologically exploitable. Together with
common sense, judgment, and taste, all can be
acquired (taught) from education and culture.
In his debate with Habermas, Gadamer was
able to defend the “universal claim of hermeneutics” that all understanding is interpretation, but
failed to show how his hermeneutics can be critical of tradition and its authority. However,
some critical abilities of philosophical hermeneutics could be detected in the process of selfreflection. One needs to become aware of one’s
prejudices by putting them “at risk,” in the effort
to understand others, the text, or tradition.
While Gadamer’s hermeneutics was conceived as
“a corrective” against the methodical alienation
of the sciences, such a pursuit could inform a critical attitude.
His theory of language lies in the area of
speech (Parole), and Gadamer stresses the fact
that he is not interested in the function of language
or propositional statements. He is concerned with

Gates, Henry Louis, Jr

296
social, political, and historical sciences, with their
interpretative (verstehenden) approaches belong
also to the immediate sphere of the influence of
his teachings. Our experience of finitude through
the inexhaustibility of the experience of meaning,
his writings on the authenticity of literary text
(Gadamer, 1989), participation in the original
phenomenon of language as dialog, indicate just
a few moments of his thought.
Paul Ricoeur has called Gadamer’s attempt a
recollection of tradition, which leaves aside the
“hermeneutics of suspicion” (Nietzsche, Marx,
Freud) (Ricoeur and Gadamer, 1982). Notwithstanding Gadamer’s intention to awaken our
“hermeneutic consciousness” and also pay attention to our “historical consciousness” which is
filled with “the multiplicity of the voices that
echo the past,” one may observe the following
in connection with Ricoeur’s remark. “The dialogue we are” might appear illuminating for
conceptualizing the existential position of the
human being. But what kind of dialog is it? Is it
in the singular? Instead of overcoming alienation
and communally being brought together, we find
ourselves participating in fragmented dialogs (of
ruptured multicultural traditions and divided
communities). Rather than the Platonic dialog, we
experience the presence of forces and power
imposing Discourses. More often, individuals,
groups, classes, sexes, nations, seem to have been
denied participation in dialog. The metaphor of
the dialog may hide and exclude areas of nondialog. In order for it to become a convincing
overall picture of human existence, it is in need
of further historicization and ability to include that
which it has left unattended.

`gay politics 
Emancipatory politics for gays
was one of the most prominent civil rights movements to develop in the United States, Canada,
Australia, and Europe during the late 1960s. Its
inspiration came, in large part, from aspects of
the Women’s Liberation Movement, sometimes
called the “second wave” of modern feminism. In
addition, calls for gay pride among gays took
their lead from Afro-Americans championing
the empowering ideal of black pride. The label
“gay” was adopted by members of this sexual
Subculture as a positive form of self-definition
to replace the term “homosexual,” a word that had
negative connotations, particularly in its clinical
context.
The founding moment of Gay Liberation is generally taken to be June 27, 1969. On that night,
large crowds in the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich
Village, New York City, gathered to mourn the
death of Judy Garland, whose public persona
and private sufferings had proved to be an
important point of identification for many gay
men. A police raid on this club backfired when
lesbians, gay men, and cross-dressed men and
women fought back so hard that the police had
to barricade themselves against attack. Rioting
against the police continued for the next five
days. Within a matter of months, national political organizations had been established in countries in the industrialized West. The first meeting
of the British Gay Liberation Front, for example,
took place at the London School of Economics
on November 13, 1970, and had its basis in
student politics.
Gay Liberation was truly revolutionary in its
earliest days. Opposed to patriarchal domination,
the structure of the nuclear family, and selfoppression, Gay Liberation insisted that lesbians
and gay men should “come out” of their “closets,” meaning that they should make a public declaration of their sexual identity so that political
change could be achieved with the strength of a
developed gay community. Reformist groups,
such as the British Committee for Homosexual
Equality and the American Mattachine Society,

frequently found it difficult in the 1970s to
coordinate their efforts with the confrontational
campaigning tactics of “gay libbers.” Public
demonstrations of Gay Pride began in the early
1970s. The first annual British Gay Pride march
took place in London on April 1, 1972. It has, for
over 20 years, attracted many thousands of men
and women who wish to celebrate their sexual
liberation. In the United States, the level of
political organization has from the outset been
very high indeed. The lesbian and gay lobby
was among the top fund raisers for President
Clinton’s electoral campaign in 1992.
It is true to say that in Britain both Gay Liberation and the Committee for Gay Equality and
equivalent American groups did not provide equal
access for lesbians, and this meant that many
women chose to put their energies into feminist
campaigns or into separatist Lesbian feminism.
Although the Gay Liberation Front lost much of
its revolutionary fervor by the early 1980s, it
none the less did much to persuade public opinion that lesbian and gay relationships were as valid
as heterosexual ones.
New life was injected into the movement, if by
a cruel Irony, by the discovery of gay men either
infected with HIV or living with AIDS in the early
1980s, leading to the formation of successful
direct action groups such as ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) on both sides of the Atlantic. There are continuing campaigns in Britain to
lower the age of consent for male same-sex relationships, and for the decriminalization of lesbians
and gay men serving in the armed forces.
In the early 1990s a younger generation of
lesbian and gay political activists developed the
highly imaginative forms of campaigning against
the Homophobia aroused by fears of HIV and
AIDS in the name of a liberatory “queer” politics. Queer activism promised to be more inclusive in terms of Genders, sexualities, and ethnic
identities than had previously been achieved by
Gay Liberation. Bisexuals, for example, began to
organize separately in the mid-1980s because
of lesbian and gay hostility towards men and
women who enjoyed both same-sex and othersex relationships. The idea of deploying “queer”
as an empowering political term when the word
still stood as an insult hurled at lesbians and gay
men was the subject of considerable controversy.
Its usage emerged in part through forms of

`gaze 
One of Jacques Lacan’s four fundamental
concepts of psychoanalysis, which he defines as
follows: “in the scopic field, the gaze is outside[;]
I am looked at[;] that is to say, I am a picture”
(Lacan, 1977, p. 106). In keeping with his theory
of the Mirror-stage, Lacan thought of such
paintings as Holbein’s The Ambassadors as a lure
or means of captivating the viewer. The gaze,
then, is what emanates from the painting itself,
capturing the viewer. In her account of the
gaze, Julia Kristeva at first implies a reversal
of the Lacanian process. Her Holbein example,
The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb, which
seems at first merely to invite the gaze of the
viewer, eventually captivates it: “Our gaze follows
the slightest physical detail, it is, as it were,
nailed, crucified, and is riveted to the hand placed
at the center of the composition” (Kristeva, 1989,
p. 114). For both Lacan and Kristeva, then, the
viewer is not a free observer but rather the captive of the painting which does the gazing, thus
turning the viewer into a picture in the ordinary
sense of the object of viewing.

Geertz, Clifford See Introduction

`gender 
A term denoting the attributes culturally ascribed to women and men. Distinctions
are conventionally drawn between gender and
sex, the latter being understood as the sum of the
physical characteristics that make us biologically
“women” and “men.” More recently, however, the
sex/gender opposition has begun to be questioned
by theorists who argue that our perceptions of
biology, nature, or indeed sex, are formed only
within language and Culture. Here, notions of
sex as beyond Culture and gender as within
it are refused, since the concept of an innate
biological sex is itself the product of, and thus
“inside” culture and history.
Though gender has been a focus of attention
across the human sciences, the main impetus for
gender critique (as opposed to its supposed disinterested study) has come in the second half of
the twentieth century from feminism. Feminists
have argued for an understanding of Femininity
and Masculinity as cultural constructs since, if
gender is culturally acquired, it becomes open to
change. Debate on the relations between culture,
power and gender has been dogged, however, by
(often fierce) disagreements, which relate in turn
to theoretical and methodological conflicts within
feminism itself. In an effort to historicize gender
analysis, many European feminists turned first, for
instance, to Marxism – a tradition valued for its
insistence on the historically constructed nature
of all social and cultural relations. Yet classical
Marxist models of economic determinism (see
Base and superstructure) proved inadequate
to the cultural analysis of gender; thus debate has
centered more recently on structuralist, poststructuralist, and psychoanalytic theories that
illuminate the specifically cultural dimensions of
gendered identity.
There are clear differences among these three
theoretical traditions. Writers influenced by
Structuralism have seen gender as the product
of universal cultural laws and conventions, of
the “grammar,” as it were, that frames linguistic
and cultural expression. Thus – to take just one
instance – structuralist accounts of gender and
narrative might focus on the conventional positioning of the male hero as active Subject and
the heroine as passive object of narrative action.

299
notions of the biological “naturalness” of gender.
Historians of sexuality, particularly since Foucault,
have made the parallel argument that sexuality is
the product of cultural processes: we are not
born, but we become bisexual or “straight,” gay
or lesbian. Sexual object choice is not, however,
straightforward. Under the prevailing Western
system of “compulsory heterosexuality” (Rich,
1980), a distinction is drawn between legitimate
and illegitimate (lesbian, gay, bisexual) sexual
practices, and heterosexuality is established as
the social norm. Importantly, the demarcation
line between heterosexuality and its opposites
enforces an equally rigid division between the genders, for the only socially legitimized expression
of sexual desire is that between “women” and
“men.” Thus in this account, gender and sexuality are interdependent, and gender transformation becomes contingent on the disruption of
heterosexual norms.

`genealogy 
A term which achieves prominence
in Michel Foucault’s post-Archaeology of
knowledge analyses of relations of power and
knowledge. Genealogy represents a radically different conception of historical analysis, one that is
influenced to a degree by the work of Nietzsche
(Foucault, 1977). In contrast to traditional forms
of historical analysis which place emphasis on
stable forms and uninterrupted continuities, genealogy emphasizes the complexity, fragility, and
contingency associated with historical events.
Genealogy draws attention to “local, discontinuous, illegitimate knowledges” and challenges
“the centralizing powers which are linked to . . .
organized scientific Discourse within a society
such as ours” (Foucault, 1980, pp. 83–4). Genealogy affirms the perspectivity of knowledge.
The publication of Discipline and Punish: The
Birth of the Prison (1977) served notice of a

genealogy

In Poststructuralism, by contrast, the notion
of universal cultural laws is jettisoned, and replaced
with a vision of meanings and identities as
the result of perpetual processes of linguistic
and cultural production. Thus, for instance, in
Judith Butler’s Foucaultian account (see Michel
Foucault and Butler, 1990), the emphasis shifts
from gender as a given Symbolic entity, to gendering as a practice that is historically productive
of gender identities. The emphasis here on the
fluidity of gender is mirrored, finally, in much
psychoanalytic theory. Here, gender is seen first as
the result of development in early infancy, centrally of the Oedipus complex, through which
boys are said to acquire an active (masculine) and
girls a passive (feminine) subjectivity. At the same
time, many theorists (for example, Mitchell and
Rose, 1985) take from psychoanalytic accounts of
the unconscious as a disruptive psychic force a
notion of the impossibility of fully stabilized
gender identity. Thus in Psychoanalysis, as in
poststructuralism, gender identity appears historically unstable, and therefore – so the argument
goes – open to political change.
If there are disagreements over the theory
and indeed the politics of gender, there is at least
some consensus on the issues at stake in gender
critique. Criticism of modern gender forms has
centered on three areas. First, gendered systems
of Binary opposition are censured for their
division of sexual identity into two opposing
camps. Against this binarism, it is argued both
that there is no necessary link between gender
and biological sex – women may espouse elements
of masculinity and vice versa, and, more radically,
that femininity and masculinity themselves are
coercive categories, imposing as they do a rigid
dualism on potentially plural meanings and
identities.
Second, critical attention has focused on the
hierarchy implicit in gender binarism, on the
assumption, that is, of masculine authority and
feminine subservience. Cultural theorists and
critics have contributed to this political dimension of gender debates by studying the role of
cultural practices and forms in consolidating – or
disrupting – gender hierarchies and norms.
A third and final dimension of the cultural
critique of gender concerns the relationship between gender dualism, sexuality, and sexual orientation. We have seen that many critics contest

`generative grammar 
A term sometimes
misleadingly used to refer to Noam Chomsky’s
approach to linguistics as a whole, though in fact
it forms only one part of his research program (see
Chomsky, Noam). A generative grammar of a language is an explicit, formal grammar which does
not assume any prior linguistic knowledge. The
term generate is a technical one from mathematics: an instruction such as “Start with 2 and add
3 four times” is said to generate the set {2, 5, 8,
11, 14,}. In linguistics, a rule such as “put adjectives before nouns” generates the set of expressions which includes hot summer, red balloon,
and so on.
A generative grammar is a model of what a
speaker of a language knows. It is not intended
to model the way a speaker actually produces
stretches of language, as an uninformed understanding of “generate” might suggest. A generative grammar is a system of knowledge that is put
to use, along with other psychological and physical mechanisms (such as recall from memory or
the operations of the ear) in producing and
understanding language.
For Chomsky a generative grammar is only a
step on the road to universal grammar (UG).
Recent work, sometimes given the name “government and binding theory” after some of its
principal theoretical concepts, has accordingly
put more emphasis on general principles of
grammar than on particular rules of grammar. A
good example is the notion of “transformational
rule” (see Transformation). In early work a special transformation was proposed for each type
of construction. Passive constructions had a passive transformation which changed (i) into (ii);
questions had a question transformation which
changed (iii) into (iv), and so on:

(i)
(ii)

The French colonized most of North Africa.
Most of North Africa was colonized by the
French.

(iii) Ruby can operate an electric drill.
(iv) Can Ruby operate an electric drill?
The main thing that these transformations do is
move words and phrases about, and recent work
replaces these construction-specific rules by a
general rule, usually called “Move-alpha,” which
means “Move anything anywhere.” This rule
obviously generates many impossible sentences
(like Most of North was colonized Africa by the
French) as well as good ones. The impossible
ones are ruled out, however, by a small set of
general principles which apply to all sentences.
One proposed principle states that only constituents can move, where a constituent is a
word and all the words that modify it. In example (i), most of North Africa is a constituent, consisting of the noun Africa with the other words
modifying the noun. Thus we can move most of
North Africa to the front of the sentence in (ii).
To compose the impossible sentence, though, we
would have to move most of North, which is not
a constituent, to the front. That is why this
example is impossible.
This principle and other more complex ones
are claimed to be part of UG by Chomsky and
his fellow researchers. It is unlikely that a linguist
who simply wanted to analyze the facts of English
would have come up with this kind of approach
to grammar. The focus on principles, rather than
rules, results from Chomsky’s basic interest in UG.

`Genette, Gérard (1930–) 
A foremost French
practitioner and theorist of Narratology. His
work on Mareel Proust’s A la Recherche du temps
perdu (1913–27) in his book Narrative Discourse:
An Essay on Method (1980) is usually considered
to be a model of narratological technique.
Genette’s theory of exactly what it is that
constitutes the concerns of narratology is most
fully expressed in Figures of Literary Discourse
(1982). Although he acknowledges the relationship

between Structuralism and Narratology,
that structuralism is the foundation for narratology, he specifies that he uses structuralism
without becoming subservient to it. His theorizing of narratology therefore consists of a movement beyond the initial structuralist impulse.
This movement takes its most concrete form in
his problematizing of the relations between the
literary Text on the one hand, and the historical
moments of its production and its reception
by the reader on the other. This leads him to
remark not only that critical Discourse is the
obverse of literary discourse, but also that the distinction between the two is somewhat blurred.
This potential contradiction is the source of
much of his work.
One of Genette’s basic principles is that there
is a fundamental difference between real, that is
poetic, language, and ordinary language. Literary
language occupies the space in between these
two extremes. To some extent he therefore privileges the poetic over the literary, although he does
attempt to deal with this problem by referring
to generic categories. Thus, for example, for
Genette one of the main indicators of generic
difference between Poetry and prose is Style. A
writer has no control over his or her style, just as
with the language itself. However, the writer is
responsible for the methods of writing which
indicate his or her classification as a novelist,
a realist, and so on. Genette does not specify
exactly what constitutes style in this context,
since it is not a method of writing. Such problems mark his text with a concern for the internal boundaries of narrative fiction, leading him
to state that he sees structuralism as resistant to
external ideological pressures. Despite this reference to structuralism’s claim to be an objective
science, he continually returns to problems posed
for structuralism by change. Every time he does
so, he reduces the problem to one of internal relations; the link between the reader and the author
is one of enmeshment; literary references are
simple transtextual repetitions; the literary text is
simply a Metonymy for the literary tradition. In
this formulation, it is the critic who invests the
text with Ideology; the text itself is already outside the play of history. His theory is a totalizing
construct.
Nevertheless, he is aware that such a procedure
is ultimately reductive, noting that structuralism

Genette, Gérard

concerns itself not with immediate appearances
or content, but with significant mental structures. Such structures are totalities in which the
component parts are dependent on the whole. But
unlike Barthes, Lévi-strauss, or Althusser,
Goldmann stresses that such structures must be
understood in terms of their origin in the historical
process. Any given totality can be inserted into a
larger totality; thus a literary Text could be seen
as a totality with its own structure, or as a component of a whole epoch of social history.
In particular Goldmann develops the concept
of a “world view,” the set of aspirations, ideas, and
feelings elaborated by a whole social Class at a
stage in its history. Such a world view is produced
by a collective Subject, but may find its most
coherent expression in a major literary or philosophical text. Goldmann gives the most concrete
exposition of the method in The Hidden God
(Goldmann, 1956). In strengthening the state
machine, Louis XIV of France undermined the
power of one section of the nobility, the noblesse
de robe, leaving it with no historical future or
hope in the world; hence many of its members
turned to Jansenism, a variety of Catholicism
stressing human inability to achieve salvation
without divine grace. Goldmann establishes a
Homology between the situation of this class
and the “tragic vision” presented in the theology
of Pascal and the plays of Racine. Although
Goldmann has been accused of downplaying
the role of the individual artist or thinker, his
stress on the collective roots of cultural creation
remains an important contribution to Cultural
theory.

is able to deal best with texts which are most
easily accessible to this kind of reading. A realization that other methods are also available lies
behind this admission, and he states that the
structuralist approach is unable to attend to the
relations between literature and social life as
a whole.

paul innes

`Geneva school 
Name given to a diverse group
of twentieth-century literary critics with varying
ties to Geneva; they have in common friendship
and a phenomenological approach that reconstitutes an implied world view from the language
of the Text. Marcel Raymond (1897–) is the
first Geneva school figure, the teacher of Jean
Rousset (1910–) and Jean Starobinski (1920–), and
the author of various works that influenced Albert
Béguin (1901–57), Georges Poulet (1902–91) and,
through Poulet, Jean-Pierre Richard (1922–).
Poulet’s influence on J. Hillis Miller (1928–)
drew the latter into the Geneva circle until the
American critic turned to Deconstruction.
Geneva critics reject objective formalist criticism
as overly mechanical, and devise various analytic
strategies to recuperate the forms of individual
consciousness exhibited in literary language.
They select evidence, usually without regard to
context, from an author’s complete writings
instead of considering separate (that is, formally
defined) works. They look for an authorial consciousness existing at a prereflexive level where
Subject and object are fused; an individual cogito (after Descartes) expressing that consciousness;
descriptions of space and time in the text as
analytic keys for reconstituting the picture of
consciousness; and the author’s projection of
different versions of reality as an evolving effort
to find harmony by reconciling daily experience
with the underlying cogito. Avoiding aesthetic
judgment, they often seek larger perspectives
in patterns of historical consciousness, in existential “authenticity,” or, later, in a psychoanalytic
framework.

`genre analysis 
In his justly celebrated
Anatomy of Criticism (1957) Northrop Frye
elegantly distinguished what he called the four
“pregeneric forms” on the basis of the sense that
forms of literary art relate to human and natural
phenomena, such as the movement from birth to
maturation and on to old age and death; to the
sequence of the cycles of the seasons; and to the
alternation of day and night. Thus he proposed
a pregeneric cycle as an analogy to the four seasons, as though charted on an undrawn circular
diagram. If a line were drawn through the center
of the circle and the lower area shaded, then a
movement within the upper half might correspond
to day or summer, the lower half to night or winter, a movement up from dark to light as spring,
and a movement down from light to dark as
fall. If one were to superimpose on these natural
forms the pregenres of romance (for summer),
Irony (for winter), Comedy (for spring) and
Tragedy (for fall), then a correspondence of
observed nature with the forms of literary art might
be determined. But when Frye turned to the
more daunting task of accounting for all of the
various literary forms – sonnets, odes, lyrics,
autobiographies, masques, etc. – he was unable
to match the profound simplicity of his pregeneric forms.
Paul Hernadi (1972), however, in a supplement
to Frye, has suggested that overlapping Frye’s
seasonal forms are the imitative genres of lyric,
dramatic, and epic, each of which imitates a
portion of what lies beyond it. According to this
scheme, lyric is an imitation of thought that
moves from an ostensible topic inward to the
consciousness of the thinker. The dramatic is a
kinetic, rather than a concentric mode, which
brings together two or more minds in communion or agon, leading to action. The epic, which
may look back to encompass lyrical, meditative
thought and dramatic kinesis, sets out to embrace
ecumenically the sense of a whole world, leaving
nothing outside. Thus the three principal genres
move from thought to action to world, each

and Gubar, Susan
(1944–) US feminist literary critics. Although
each member of this pair is an accomplished
critic in her own right, it is as a team that Gilbert
and Gubar have made the most significant impact
on Feminist criticism in the United States.
Their monumental study of nineteenth-century
British and American women writers, The
Madwoman in the Attic (1979), in some sense
represents the apex of American feminist work
in the 1970s on women’s literary tradition and
the female imagination. In a lively, yet densely
informative style, Gilbert and Gubar analyzed
the response of women writers to severe cultural
restraints, especially to gendered ideologies of
literary and cultural authority that denied women’s
agency and creativity. Revising Harold Bloom’s
theory of the Anxiety of influence, Gilbert
and Gubar showed how women’s texts come to
share a specific, coherent set of themes, images,
Tropes, Symbols, formal structures, and narrative strategies that, however guarded or disguised,
express women’s rage at cultural dispossession, their
madness and fragmentation within patriarchy,
and rebellion against it. Madwoman, which was
runner-up for a Pulitzer Prize in 1980, was enthusiastically received as brilliant proof of the existence of a separate female literary tradition, and
further, as proof that women’s writings must be
evaluated on their own aesthetic terms. Still,
some feminists criticized the book for its reductive approach to women’s Art, its suggestion
that all women’s Texts ultimately signify the
same thing (repressed female anger), and its tendency to valorize the experience of white, middleclass, English-speaking women, to generalize in a
way that implied the existence of a single women’s
Culture and universal female Aesthetic. In
1985 Gilbert and Gubar’s Norton Anthology of
Literature by Women was similarly received:
gratefully, as a Symbol of the new legitimacy of

feminist critical approaches to women writers,
and nervously, as a premature effort to create a
Canon of women writers in English that would
surely harden notions of literary history and patterns of inclusion and exclusion that feminist
critics had yet thoroughly to understand, let
alone come to consensus about. In 1988 Gilbert
and Gubar extended the argument of Madwoman
to twentieth-century women writers in their gargantuan, two-volume No Man’s Land. As coeditors,
they have produced two volumes of feminist essays
on Poetry and poetics: Shakespeare’s Sisters in
1979 and The Female Imagination and the Modernist Aesthetic in 1986. Gilbert and Gubar’s work
is not only required reading for specialists in
women’s literature, but their collaboration itself
has played a role in the history of Women’s
studies. It has sparked an important discussion
about the value and significance of collaboration
in feminist methodology, as opposed to patriarchal practices of intellectual hierarchy, competition, and individual ownership of ideas.

`Girard, René (1923–) 
French literary theorist.
Girard has spent most of his career in the United
States. He has taught at various universities
including SUNY-Buffalo, Johns Hopkins University, and Stanford University, where he is currently
professor of French language, literature, and
civilization. Girard is best known for a theory of
mimesis, which argues that all human desire is
imitative and not innate. Mimetic desire is triangular in structure and encompasses a relation
between a Subject, an object, and a mediator.
Mediation can be either internal or external.

Girard, René

encompassing what comes before, and all unstable in reference to the others.

Giroux, Henry

304
Internal mediation requires a mediator who is
historically accessible to the subject like a friend
or a rival. External mediation requires a mediator who is not immediately available like, say,
Napoleon, Freud, etc. It is mediation and not
intrinsic properties that make objects desirable.
If desire is mediated, then desire becomes the desire
to be the other. Girard introduces the resonant
phrase “ontological sickness” to describe this
phenomenon. What is sought in the other is the
promise of being. Girard’s theory of mimetic
desire was first worked out in Deceit, Desire, and
the Novel (1966).
Girard has derived a new theory of psychology
from his notion of mimetic desire. His critique
of Freudian Psychoanalysis revolves around
the two key psychoanalytic myths, namely those
of Oedipus and Narcissus. Girard rejects both the
importance of sexuality and the libidinal quest
for objects in the Freudian model, for they do
not incorporate mimetic desire. In the Oedipal
model Freud seems to imply that the child’s
desire for the mother is originary; this overlooks
the mimetic structure of Oedipal desire. It is in
imitating the father that the child acquires a
desire for the mother. In Girard’s words “[t]he
mimetic process detaches desire from any predetermined object, whereas the Oedipus complex
fixes desire on the maternal object.” Girard denies
that narcissism exists in the way Freud implies
that it does. Freud’s prototype of the narcissitic
subject, the so-called narcissistic woman, does
not really have a sufficient sense of being; she
merely pretends to have this aura of being as a
ruse to catch the desire of others. Girard’s theory
of mimetic desire also implies a new account of
other psychoanalytic concepts like masochism,
sadism, and homosexuality. The masochist is a
subject who is unwilling to recognize lack in the
mediator of desire. He would rather hold on to
the illusion that being exists in someone else
even if it is denied to him. Masochism then consists of the choice of mediators who will forbid
access to the object(s) of desire. In sadism there
is a reversal of structure. The sadist convinces himself that he has in fact attained to a sufficiency of
being and can therefore be the mediator for
another subject who will be denied his object(s)
of desire. Homosexuality can also be understood
as a perversion of mimesis. Here desire is transferred from the object to the mediator. If all

desire is mimetic, then Girard will need to address
the origin of this desire and seek to understand
its function in the Symbolic. This he seeks to do
with the concept of the scapegoat.
Mimetic desire can lead to conflict and violence.
In Violence and the Sacred (1977) Girard emphasizes the fact the violence is often visited on a
surrogate victim. This victim can decrease the
intensity of violence generated in a social context
by functioning as a scapegoat. Scapegoating tends
to be communal. Once the scapegoat has been
killed, it ironically takes on the aura of a savior.
It is revered for having restored harmony in the
community. Girard has read Greek tragedy and
other literary Texts as evidentiary of scapegoating. Girard’s interest in myth also stems from their
connection to the problematic of scapegoating. He
argues that myths are not pieces of fiction but have
roots in the real. The thematics of myths reveal
a transition from a structure of undifferentiation
to a differentiation that is achieved by the death
of the victim. In The Scapegoat (1986) Girard
moves from myth to the Texts of persecution. He
argues that scapegoating no longer works to
insure social harmony in the Judeo-Christian
world as it once did. He credits this to the Bible’s
portrayal of the victim’s perspective. In recent years
Girard has produced “nonsacrificial” readings of
biblical myths, most notably in Job: The Victim
of His People (1987) and Things Hidden since the
Foundation of the World (1987).

`Glyph 
A journal of textual studies with a brief
but interesting history, which can best be explained in two distinct phases, as a publication first
of the Johns Hopkins University Press and later
of the University of Minnesota Press.
Samuel Weber, associate professor of comparative literature at Johns Hopkins when he
founded Glyph in 1977, announced the journal’s
program: to encourage intellectual discourse on
methods of representation and textuality. The
goal of the journal was to challenge the boundaries of what Weber called the “crisis of representation” and the “practice of textuality.” Among
the more pressing issues, as Weber saw it, was the
“problematization of the representational framework of Western metaphysics,” especially in the
work of Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Heidegger,
and Derrida.
The Statement to Contributors printed in
each issue welcomed papers concerned with “the
confrontation between American and Continental
critical scenes,” a topic which remained a vital
concern during the initial years of the journal’s
publication. During this time, and in the second
phase as well, Glyph published papers by an
impressive group of contributors. The editorial
board, too, was prominent in the table of contents. The first issue of Glyph included articles by
Weber and his coeditor Henry Sussman, three
articles by board members, and one each by Paul
de Man (“The purloined ribbon”) and Jacques
Derrida (“Signature event context”).
The first phase of Glyph, a semi-annual publication, ended with volume 8 in 1981. In his

closing remarks, a dejected Weber traced dwindling circulation patterns and noted that the
journal had strayed from its original intentions,
suggesting also that the journal had been associated too closely with Derrida’s Of Grammatology
and Deconstruction, a concept which was
hinted at but never explicitly mentioned in the
opening program. Glyph’s second phase, Weber
explained here, included a move to the University
of Minnesota – where, incidentally, Weber himself moved – and a switch to a yearly publication
schedule. These technical changes, according to
Weber, required a “redefinition of the situation
and character of our work, deriving from the
experiences accumulated during our first four
years of publication.” The new series, not published until 1986, only lasted several years, during which time it was edited by Weber, Sussman,
and Wlad Godzich, who established in their preface the journal’s shift in focus from a concern
with problems of representation to an emphasis
on a “greater currency of concerns” arising from
contemporary criticism. As part of this shift,
each volume was to revolve around a central
issue; Demarcating the Disciplines, the title of the
1986 publication, is a prime example.

`Goldmann, Lucien (1913–70)
 Romanian–
French cultural theorist. After youthful clandestine activity in a Marxist organization, Goldmann
left his native Romania and went in 1934 to
France, where he spent most of the rest of his life.
A committed Marxist, Goldmann was profoundly
hostile to Stalinism, and thus rather isolated
among French left intellectuals before 1968. An
advocate of “revolutionary reformism” in the
1960s, his revolutionary commitment revived in
1968.
For Goldmann, philosophy, literature, and
Art are all rooted in the daily life of human
beings in specific societies, and are to be seen as
means of responding to the fundamental human
problems which arise in these societies. Goldmann
applied his methodological approach of Genetic
structuralism to a wide range of fields; the
philosophy of Kant; Jansenism in seventeenthcentury France; a critique of Empiricism in sociology; Reification in the twentieth-century
novel; and the theater of Jean Genet. Goldmann’s

where a Self/Other dichotomy would yield to an
exchange between the Self and An/other (autrui).

`Gombrich, Ernst (1909–2001)
 Austrianborn British art historian. The story of Sir Ernst
Gombrich’s life as an art historian is told
by Gombrich himself in two places: in “An
Autobiographical Sketch” from Topics Of Our
Time: Twentieth-Century Issues in Learning and Art
(1991) and in the dialogue between Didier
Eribon and himself from Looking for Answers:
Conversations on Art and Science (1993). The
first illustration in the Conversations book is a
photograph of Gombrich, aged about 4, holding
up an earthworm for the camera. While this
photograph does not have the technical mastery
that Gombrich finds in the work of Henri
Cartier-Bresson, discussed in the last essay in the
Topics book (the head and face, and the earthworm, are somewhat out of focus, while the
embroidery on the shirt and the shiny belt are
vividly recorded and preserved), it does have
the look of the selection of the “right moment”
that is consistent in the experience of CartierBresson’s work and occasionally can be found in
the lucky snapshot. Perhaps in this photograph
of a youthful Gombrich can be seen the art historian who is eager to share and takes pleasure in
sharing his discoveries, and who, like Leonardo
da Vinci (whom he admires above all), puts
nature before art.
That he was born in Vienna was important to
Gombrich because it was a place where, at that
time, psychology and music could enter his life.
Upon entering Vienna University, he chose to read

art history with Julius van Schosser, “a wise
teacher of doubts,” rather than with Josef
Strzygowski, who was known for the polemic
approach of his lectures. Gombrich’s PhD thesis
on Giulio Romano’s Palazzo del Te showed that
Mannerism could be better understood as a
search for surprising and dramatic effects to suit
the tastes of the Gonzaga court of Mantua,
rather than as the result of a psychological crisis
during the age. At this time he was invited by Ernst
Kris to work with him in applying Freud’s ideas
about wit to the visual arts through a study of
caricature. It was through Kris that Gombrich
was recommended to Fritz Saxl of the Warburg
Institute, which had recently moved from Hamburg to London.
During the war years in England Gombrich was
one of the group that monitored radio broadcasts
from Germany. From this unpromising task
Gombrich learned a useful lesson about perception by the need to fill in the sometimes meaningless sounds of the broadcasts with words that
were suggested to him by his knowledge of the
language and the context of the message. After the
war Gombrich returned to art history, writing
about the mythologies of Botticelli. This paper
is one of those collected in the volume, Symbolic
Images: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance (1972),
which is one of four volumes of Gombrich’s
collected essays in Renaissance art and culture.
Earlier, while still in Vienna, Gombrich had written what had become a successful world history
book for children. As a companion volume, the
publisher suggested that Gombrich write a history
of art for children. From that idea came The
Story of Art, first published in 1950, and now in
its sixteenth English edition (1995). This popular commentary on the history of art led to the
double life that Gombrich says he has, being
known by some only as the author of The Story
of Art and by others only as the author of scholarly papers. Rather, this makes clear what is a special strength of Gombrich’s work: that it brings
together the broad insights of the generalist with
the sharp focus of the specialist.
The idea of the play between knowing and
seeing in the experience of pictures around
which The Story of Art is structured was further
developed by Gombrich in the light of the psychology of perception in the influential Art and

Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial
Representation (1960). In this study, Gombrich
explains that changes in representational art occur
when an artist modifies the schematic conventions
of image-making by examining the schema against
the observation of nature. The idea of the process of making and matching proceeding through
schema and correction is also generally the subject of the papers collected in The Image and the
Eye: Further Studies in the Psychology of Pictorial
Representation (1982). Norman Bryson turns a
critical Gaze on this idea, arguing that a description of the image as a surface for perceiving
rather than for producing meaning supresses the
reality of the image as Sign, and makes the
viewer as a historical as the physiology of sight.
The Sense of Order: A Study in the Psychology of
Decorative Art (1979) was written, Gombrich
said, partly as an antidote to the criticism of Art
and Illusion that he was concerned only with
representation in Art. This thematic study of
decoration in light of information theory examines the play between expectation and surprise
which shapes messages conveyed in words, music,
and decorative motifs. The choice of this topic itself
was for Gombrich an application of this theory,
in that by choosing the neglected Subject of decoration and approaching a more general problem
in the discipline, Gombrich was interrupting the
pattern of sameness and narrowness that he generally sees in the literature of art history.
Gombrich finds that, while the current study
of art history examines questions of interest,
such as women, blacks, and the art market, it
does not concern itself enough with art. In the
Epilogue of Conversations, Gombrich says that
he sees the art historian as fighting for values.
Then when asked what values he is fighting for,
he answers, “I think I can say this is very simply:
the traditional civilization of Western Europe.”
In this time of emphasis in the discipline on
diversity, Multiculturalism, and interdisciplinary approaches, Gombrich is a staunch
defender of traditional art history. Perhaps this
Gombrich also can be seen in the snapshot of the
four-year-old with the earthworm, who insists that
we view the object of his interest that he steadfastly holds up to the camera for display.

problems of deciphering, studies of writing have
been paradoxically historical undertakings (Ducrot
and Todorov, 1972). For this reason the efforts
of grammatologists to uncover the historical origins of writing have been impossible, since they
necessarily rely on written records, which obviously do not extend into preliteracy. Nevertheless,
grammatology sets out to counter the disparaging treatment of writing in linguistics that goes
back to Jakobson, Saussure, Rousseau, and
beyond. In the history of philosophy the scandal
of writing is as old as Plato’s Phaedrus. For
Saussure, writing is a monstrous and pathological imposition on speech, which for Rousseau was
the “natural” condition of language. Derrida,
however, in his Of Grammatology (1967) set out
to expose not only the Platonic and Rousseauist
use of writing to privilege speech, but also the
related misconception that spoken language
makes the objects of signification present, and the
reliance of Western theology and metaphysics on
these maneuvers. Grammatology thus reaches
deeply into the recesses of philosophy of
Language and Culture.

`Gramsci, Antonio (1891–1937)
 Marxist
theorist and political activist. Gramsci’s main
contribution to Marxism is widely thought to lie
in his elaboration of the notion of Hegemony.
Gramsci was born in Sardinia, and from the age
of 11 was obliged to work to augment the income
of his impoverished family. Despite difficulties
of both finance and health, Gramsci won a
scholarship in 1910 at Turin University where he
specialized in linguistics and philology, falling
under the influence of the idealist philosophers
Benedetto Croce and Francesco De Sanctis. But
Gramsci was already a socialist and moved in
a circle of like-minded companions including
Palmiro Togliatti and Angelo Tasca. Gramsci
eventually forsook his brilliant studies for an
active life in politics.

In Turin Gramsci became involved in the
working-class movement which, partly as a
result of the 1914–18 war, was on a rising wave
of militancy. He joined the Italian Socialist Party
(PSI) in 1913 and by 1917 had been elected
Secretary of the Socialist Section in Turin. By
the end of the war, Gramsci’s study of Marx,
Engels, and Lenin had impelled him to reject
philosophical idealism. In 1919 he founded the
newspaper Ordine Nuovo (New Order), an organ
of the Factory Councils’ movement in Turin
which aimed to reach out to the Italian proletariat,
articulating its real problems and goals. The
focus of Gramsci’s theory and practice was the
means whereby the workers’ movement could
gain power (Gramsci, 1977, p. 133), this being one
of the broad ramifications of his later concept of
political hegemony. In preparation for the
Russian Revolution of 1917, Lenin and Trotsky
had sought to displace state capitalist trusts by
administrative councils called “soviets,” democratic
organs of working-class power reminiscent of
the Paris Commune. These councils, comprising
deputies from factory workers to whom they
were answerable, had organized political strikes
and demonstrations and had armed the workers.
They had been perceived by Trotsky as an
embryonic form of a workers’ government.
Seeking to extend the historical role of such
councils beyond their Russian context, Gramsci
looked to the Italian Factory Councils to assume
a similar function (Gramsci, 1957, p. 22). Gramsci
stated that Ordine Nuovo was built around the
hypothesis of “autonomous revolutionary action”
by the working class; as such he resisted the idea
of his old comrade Tasca that the Factory Committees should align themselves with the Trade
Unions and federations; these, Gramsci insisted,
rested on merely private and contractual obligations,
whereas the Councils were a public institution.
Such autonomous revolutionary potential on
the part of the proletariat could only be realized,
argued Gramsci, through political and intellectual
autonomy. A mass movement alone was insufficient: its unity needed to embrace both northern and southern Italy, as can be gleaned from
Gramsci’s preoccupying argument in his later
essay “The southern question,” but also, initiated
through a vanguard with working-class roots and
sympathies, this class “must train and educate itself
in the management of society,” acquiring both the

309
general cultural and political struggle towards
a socialist order. The most persistent theme of
the notebooks straddled both philosophical and
political domains: the link between the intelligentsia and revolutionary practice, which forms
a continuous thread running through Gramsci’s
thought both prior to and after his incarceration.
In an essay on the formation of intellectuals,
Gramsci argued that every class aspiring toward
power and entering an economically dominant role
in the theater of history creates a group of intellectuals, organically united with its economic
imperatives. These “organic” intellectuals confer
upon the class homogeneity, consciousness of its
function, as well as organizing society so as to facilitate the expansion of this class. However, the class
must also assimilate and conquer a portion of
the “traditional” intellectuals, those bound to
the previous order; this will help to veil even the
most radical upheavals under the mantle of historical continuity. The relation between intellectuals and the means of production itself is of course
indirect, mediated by a complex superstructure
of which intellectuals are the “officials.”
There are, says Gramsci, two “floors” or bases
of superstructure: civil society, consisting of
private organizations, and political society
which is the state. It is within the former sphere
that intellectuals exert their function of social
hegemony, encouraging a “spontaneous consent” on the part of the populace to ruling-class
ideas and ambitions. In contrast, the state legally
insures discipline through direct rule and coercion. Gramsci’s use of “intellectual” here is broad,
covering the hierarchy from original thinkers
and scientists at the apex to administrators and
propagators of received class wisdom at the bottom. Gramsci points out that the mass formation
of intellectuals in modern society has led to
their sharing the standardized features of other
masses: competition, unemployment, (scholarly)
overproduction, and emigration.
From a revolutionary standpoint, this mass
of intellectuals is precisely what is required. In “The
southern question” Gramsci urges that this mass
intellectual formation must endure a break, part
of it arising as a left-wing tendency oriented
towards the revolutionary proletariat (Gramsci,
1957, p. 51). In “The modern prince” Gramsci’s
starting point is Machiavelli’s “revolutionary”
inquiry into what the prince must be in order to

culture and psychology of a dominant class
through its own channels: “meetings, congresses,
discussions, mutual education.” Moreover, the
“laws of the workers’ State need to be executed
by the workers themselves” (Gramsci, 1977, p. 171).
Only then will political compromise in all its
guises be forestalled. Ordine Nuovo had aimed precisely to install itself as a platform for focusing such
preparatory activities: to convince workers and
peasants to arrive at their own conception of the
world through workmen’s circles and youth
groups as well as to develop “new forms of intellectualism” grounded in the practical experience
of working-class life (Gramsci, 1957, pp. 21, 122).
Working-class solidarity showed itself in a
confrontation with Turin industrialists and a
general strike which, though unsuccessful, further
galvanized the movement. However, disillusioned over the Socialist Party’s failure to impress
its image on the course of events, Gramsci and
others formed the Italian Communist Party
(PCI) in 1921. Faced with a consolidation of the
Fascist regime, Gramsci strategically reneged on
his earlier sectarianism, calling for the Communists to align themselves with all forms of
opposition to fascism, by now the only realistic
hope. Visiting Moscow in 1922, he returned in 1924
to assume leadership of the Party, and founded
its journal Unità (Ordine Nuovo having been
coerced into closing down). In the Parliamentary elections of April, 19 Communist candidates,
including Gramsci, were elected, notwithstanding
the oppressive climate of intimidation by Fascist
squads. But the Fascists won an overwhelming
victory and in 1925 Mussolini announced his
own dictatorship. Gramsci was arrested in 1926
and sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment. After
11 years of maltreatment and confinement, during which he never once saw his Russian
wife Giulia Schucht or his two small children,
Gramsci died in 1937.
Gramsci wrote some 34 notebooks while in
prison, ranging from literary topics such as
Dante and Pirandello to philosophical and political themes. These were not published until after
Mussolini’s downfall. Gramsci’s Literary criticism insisted on understanding literary production within its historical and political context
(as against Croce’s ahistorical view of Art as
autonomous) and, following De Sanctis, viewed
the critic’s task as one of harmonizing with the

graphic narrative

310
The dissemination of Marxism at a populist
cultural level, while imperative, is utterly inadequate for overcoming the Ideology of the educated classes. Gramsci views Marxism as still in
its popularizing stage, but adds that it contains
within itself the dialectical principle for overcoming this. It must now enter the long process
of developing a core of intellectuals; in this light,
Gramsci’s notion of hegemony might be viewed
as an interesting attempt to extend Marxist theory
in general on the basis of a practice whose theorizing was rooted in the particular exigencies of
an Italian context. On account of the political and
practical shrewdness underlying Gramsci’s theories, he is widely regarded as one of the foremost
contributors to the Marxist cause.

lead the people to the foundation of a new state.
The modern prince, Gramsci explains, can no
longer be an individual but an organism: the
political party which aims to found a new type
of state. This transformation to a socialist state
cannot be successful without the proletariat’s
own organic intellectuals forging an alternative
hegemony.
Underlying Gramsci’s notion of hegemony
are certain fundamental readings of Marx and
Marxism. Above all, he views Marxism as an
integrated scheme, encompassing not only philosophy, history, and politics, but also the grounding of these in economic life. This emerges, for
example, in a review where he chastises Bukharin
for his mechanical separation of the various tendencies of Marx’s work. Gramsci’s view acts as a
broad preface to the notion of hegemony which
is effectively a metonymic affirmation of the
dialectical connection between economic and superstructural spheres, stressing the transformative
role of human agency rather than relying on the
“inevitability” of economic determinism. Moreover, Gramsci regards Marx’s most fundamental
innovation in political science as his insistence
that human nature is historically determined,
rather than being abstract, fixed, and immutable
(Gramsci, 1957, p. 140). It is this which endows
with a wealth of philosophical and political
coherence Gramsci’s characterization of the state
which presides enablingly over the propriety of
his view of hegemony: “the State must be seen as
an ‘educator’ in that it aims precisely to create
a new type and level of civilisation” as well as a
certain type of citizen (Gramsci, 1957, p. 187). It
is because civil society and the state educate or
mold human nature into a vehicle of consent and
conformity that, given a broad democratic educational base, the organic intellectuals can initiate the process whereby the proletariat remolds
its own humanity.
Gramsci’s view of hegemony is also perhaps an
attempt to answer what he sees as a deficiency in
the history of Marxism. In “Marxism and modern culture” he suggests that two crucial tasks have
confronted Marxist theory and practice: to combat modern ideologies in their most refined
form, thereby attracting and creating its own
independent core of intellectuals; and to educate
the masses. The second task, says Gramsci, has
absorbed Marxism at the expense of the first.

Greenberg, Clement

314

`Greenberg, Clement (1909–1994) 
American art critic, considered by Michael Fried to be
“the foremost critic of new painting and sculpture of our time.” Grounded in Kant’s selfcritical method (his use of logic to examine the
limits of logic) and nourished by the Marxist view
of capitalist culture, the two basic components of
Greenberg’s criticism appear in “Avant-garde
and Kitsch” (1939): that Art is about its own

craft, specifically that painting is about the forms
inherent to it, and that new art is a revolt against
materialist tradition. These components are used
by Greenberg to seek an understanding of the
modernist art with which his criticism is most
readily associated, namely abstract expressionism,
which he later preferred to call painterly abstraction (and which Harold Rosenberg characterized
as action painting). The essentials of this art, described in “American-type painting” (1955), include
first, an emphasis on surface (for example, the
pulsating flatness of Marc Rothko), second, a
de-emphasis of value contrasts (that is, the
pulverization of light/dark contrast by Pollock),
and third, a large format to make up for the loss
of the illusion of space resulting from the first two.
Also essential to this art was that it emerged as a
major art by assimilating the major art of preceding
periods. This is emphasized in the essay “Modernist painting” (1961), where the fundamental effect
of flatness that painting sought, as self-criticism
of painting eliminated the effect of any other
medium from itself, was traced backed from
Mondrian, through cubism and impressionism,
to the suppression of sculptural effects in sixteenthcentury Venetian painting. Greenberg’s Post Painterly Abstraction (1964) equates the work of the
Color Field painters (that is Morris Louis and
Kenneth Noland) with Impressionism, and sees
its essential form – openness – as a reaction to
the closed, centralized images of abstract expressionism. Criticism of Greenberg’s criticism centers
for some critics (T.J. Clark) on its formalism –
the belief that painting is primarily about its
medium as form rather than its medium as
meaning, and for others (Rosalind Krauss) on
its Historicism – the belief that painting has a
universal meaning inherent to it alone, and that
the meaning of the work of art is a condition of
the path it has traveled through history. Perhaps the
most vivid criticism of Greenberg’s Formalism
and historicism is to be seen in the 1966 event
by the British conceptual artist John Latham:
Greenberg’s book Art and Culture was checked out
of St Martin’s School of Art library, some pages
from it were selected to be chewed, others to be
chemically treated, and together fermented with
yeast and bottled – and then a year later the
book was returned to the library in this form. This
event has entered the history of art as Latham’s

`Greimas, Algirdas Julien (1917–1992)
Lithuanian theorist of Semiotics who lived in
France. His work on structural semantics has
had some influence upon Narratology.
Greimas’s work is a movement toward a linguistic theory that will deal with all the ways in
which meaning is produced in literary language,
from sentences, through discursive passages, to the
full significance of a Text and its relations with

other texts. He begins from a basic structuralist
premise: that there is a commonality of language
which constitutes a sort of set of all that it is
possible to say or write (see Langue/parole),
and which is composed of Binary oppositions.
However, he develops this theory in order to
try to account for changes in the meanings of
specific lexical elements as they are utilized in
different sentences. He does so by invoking the
structuralist account of meaning being produced
as an operation of difference (see Ferdinand de
Saussure). For Greimas the different uses of a
lexical item in different contexts produces a network of differential meanings which is set up by
the repetition of the item. Thus the use of the same
word in two different sentences throws up a
double set of binary oppositions: one for the
meanings produced in each sentence in and of itself
(see Actant), and another for the relation between the two sentences. This formulation is
known as the semiotic rectangle, a figure which
performs a unifying operation between the two
sentences. This figure accounts for the meanings
produced by the relationship between the two sentences. As one moves from sentence to sentence,
a coherent picture of meaning for the text as
a whole is gradually produced from the individual
sentences and their relations with one another.
Layers of meaning accumulate harmoniously
and coherently in such a way that every layer complements the others. In this formulation, every level
should shed light on the features of every other
level, so that a construction of unitary meaning
is objectively achieved.
Greimas is, however, aware that his theory is
problematical, given that the identification of
these kinds of correspondences can vary radically from reader to reader. Cultural context
impinges upon his attempt to produce, in a classic structuralist move, an objective science of
reading. He attempts to resolve this problem by
reference to a form of Literary competence.
Analysis of the various levels of meaning, from a
single word up to relations between texts, is
organized in strata of classification which are
always subject to the reader recognizing the
meanings. The repetition of elements of the
levels of classification is at the heart of the production of meaning in this schema. However,
this operation may not always be successful if
a reader does not have access to the cultural

baggage which might be assumed to be necessary
for a full reading of the sort proposed by Greimas.

produce a comprehensive theory of narrative,

cultural change.

`Grice, Paul (1913–88) 
Until moving to
America, Grice was a distinguished figure in postwar Oxford philosophy, whose main influence has
been on the theories of meaning and conversation/communication. In his “Meaning” (Grice,
1989, essay 14), he crucially distinguished between
two general kinds of meaning, “natural” and
“nonnatural,” illustrated respectively by “Those
spots mean measles” and “That remark, ‘He’s a
pig,’ means that John is greedy.” The second
kind, which is the main concern of linguists and
philosophers, is analyzed in terms of intention.
Roughly, a speaker means that P by his remark
if he openly intends his audience to believe that
P, and on the basis of their recognition of that
intention. (This is elaborated in Grice, 1989;
essays 5–6.) A controversial consequence of this
approach is that the meanings of sentences are
functions of the intentions which speakers
would generally have in uttering them.
Grice often stresses that utterances typically
“implicate” (for example, intimate, suggest) something other than what they strictly say. His theory of conversation (Grice, 1989, essays 2–3) is
designed to explain this. Conversation standardly
proceeds on the assumption that the speakers
are obeying various “maxims” (for example, “Be
relevant,” “Speak the truth.” An important issue
is whether these “maxims” are, as Grice seems to
hold, cultural universals.) Hearers identify what
is “implicated,” typically by working out what
speakers must be intending to convey, given that
they are, despite appearances, obeying the “maxims.”
This suggests an interesting way of accounting for
the identification of metaphorical and ironical

meanings. Much recent work in pragmatics
takes its lead from Grice’s theory of conversation
(for example, Sperber and Wilson, 1986).

gynocritics as theoretically naive, criticizing
gynocritics’ failure to question the apparent
transparency of language as a medium of representation (Moi, 1985). While gynocritics might
have launched a more forceful defense of the
humanist project (the fulfillment of which, after
all, would entail revolutionary social change),
since the late 1980s there has been extensive
work synthesizing American and French feminist
approaches, as well as eloquent defenses of the
heterogeneity of feminist discourse, which have
allowed feminist scholars to move beyond this
acrimonious debate. Today, gynocritics tends to
incorporate poststructural insights, and remains
one of the most exciting and productive modes
of scholarship.

(1985), and one of the fullest realizations of gynocritical theory remains Showalter’s A Literature
of Their Own (1977). In the 1970s, scholars working on women of color criticized gynocritics’
racial biases, exclusions, and faulty generalizations,
but through the 1970s and 1980s, most work on
women writers of color can also be classified as
gynocritical. One of gynocritics’ earliest projects
(which remains ongoing) has been the recovery
and reevaluation of a vast number of femaleauthored texts. Combined with similar projects
in black and ethnic studies, this work has forced
an extensive reconfiguration of the literary Canon
since the mid-1970s. Gynocritics has produced
numerous studies of individual authors, as well
as literary histories for women writers of virtually every period; such studies often emphasize
the relation between genre and Gender, and
increasingly, between genre, gender, Race, Class,
and nationality. Without always acknowledging
it, earlier gynocritical work relied on a particular
theory of mimesis: women writers apprehend
objective reality and describe it directly in their
Texts, rendering texts authentic mirrors of female
subjectivity and records of female experience.

H

`Habermas, Jürgen (1929–) 
German philosopher, sociologist, and critical thinker. He has
been the most influential philosopher in Germany
since the 1960s with frequent interventions as
a social and political critic. In the 1990s his
influence extended rapidly not only on the Continent, but also in the Anglo-Saxon academic
world.
He has been a member of the Frankfurt
school for Social Research and shares with it
Hegelian and Marxist views of history, society,
and its evolution. His Critical theory is
rooted in the spirit of the critical theory of the
Frankfurt school, although it has been transformed and directed to the Symbolic forms of
social interaction (language and communication).
His early attempts to formulate a “critical social
theory with practical intent,” that is, a critical
theory of modern capitalist society, initially
focused on the critique of “scientism” (the positivist belief of sciences in themselves as the only
category of possible knowledge) and the associated “technocratic consciousness” which imposes
technocratic ideals on practical life.
Habermas never accepted the pessimism of the
Frankfurt school’s conception of “instrumental
reason” (reason used entirely as an instrument
within a “means–ends” rationality) prevailing in
capitalist societies. He believed that reason had not
been eclipsed in modern societies, but that it was
still available in the form of an emancipatory
interest. The critique of scientism could free his

critical theory from positivist beliefs in pure
theory and allow for a solution to the problem
of connecting theory and its practical implementation, away from the instrumental solutions
provided by the expert.
The search for epistemological foundations
for his critical theory was pursued in Knowledge
and Human Interests (1968). In it (drawing
from Peirce, Dilthey, and Freud), Habermas
linked “knowledge” to three (a priori) cognitive
interests: technical, practical, and emancipatory,
corresponding respectively to the natural sciences,
social sciences, and the critical science of Psychoanalysis. Psychoanalytic science (with its
depth-hermeneutical analysis and its ability for
self-reflection) was considered to be an exemplary
existing model of critique and emancipation,
which could eventually provide the basic features
for his critical social theory.
As in psychoanalysis, the idea of “distorted
speech” is transported to societal forms in order
to comprehend Ideology as “systematically
distorted communication.” Although Habermas
never demarcated convincingly what could count
as normal speech situation, the concept of
ideology was removed and studied beyond its
classical definition as false knowledge. He also
contended that society could now be analyzed
in terms of language, labor, and power (overcoming Marx’s limitations, who had reduced
the self-formation of the species exclusively to the
category of labor). In order to locate distorted

319
truth claims, claims of normative rightness, and
claims to sincere expressions) can be decided
upon the reasons and insights provided by the participants. Claims of this kind are open to criticism
and validation. Disputed claims are treated in
argumentation, and agreement can be reached
without resorting to force.
According to Habermas, “communicative
rationality” refers to our experience of unconstrained argumentative speech and its unifying
consensus. This perspective originates in the
function of language for social integration or the
coordination of plans of different actors in social
interaction. Communicative rationality ensures
that our efforts are oriented toward intersubjective understanding and agreement without the
use of force. As long as communicative rationality (aiming at consensual agreement) increases
within a “communication community” we observe
the expansion of unconstrained coordination
of action and consensual resolution of conflicts
(provided they are not beyond the bounds of
cognitive approach). The rationality of everyday
communicative practice uses argumentation as a
“court of appeal.” It continually excludes direct
or strategic use of force.
His main hypothesis is that we live in a lifeworld
in which we coordinate our actions through
communication. It is with this coordination that
the species maintains itself. Although modern
societies are penetrated by cognitive–purposive
rationality, which results in teleological actions, the
basic core which underlies all forms of community is communicative rationality. In this way
Habermas is able to advance the claims of his social
theory by providing a universalistic and thus
objective bond as the foundation of every society.
The strength of his paradigm of communicative
rationality, as he agrees, depends upon the fruitfulness of research programs which are based
on it.
The lifeworld guarantees the unity of the objective world and the intersubjectivity between its
members (for action coordination), thus promoting the process of understanding and consensus.
The lifeworld always shapes the background and
remains implicit and precritical. The lifeworld
carries with it cultural tradition and is essential
for the socialization of the individual. Opposite
to it operate social Systems, such as the economy
and state administration. While the lifeworld is

communication, he incorporated some areas
of Hermeneutics into his critical theory. In a
lengthy debate with Gadamer he defended his
use of hermeneutics as a critical force in his
theory, but he also gained invaluable insights
for adopting hermeneutics in his later writings
on social theory and communicative actions.
Criticizing the ideological mechanisms producing distorted communication in modern
societies, Habermas proposed the concept of “ideal
speech situation” (as an ideal of free and unconstrained communication) which could play the role
of a normative conception.
The notion of “reconstructive sciences” was
employed to indicate those scientific projects
which employ a Kantian notion of reflection
(by asking, for example, what are the necessary
conditions for a specific human competence).
In the 1970s he continued his reconstructive
attempts in the linguistic field in order to provide
a “universal pragmatics,” that is, a theory of the
universal features of human linguistic competences (basic structures and fundamental rules),
which could clarify his notion of communication
and the deviant case of systematically distorted
communication. At the same time he worked
on a theory of social evolution (in affinity to his
Marxist–Hegelian heritage), as a “reconstruction
of historical materialism.” In this attempt social
evolution can be understood as the development
of learning capacities of the species as both development of moral insight and empirical knowledge
referring to technological advances and mastery
of nature.
In 1981, with the publication of his Theory of
Communicative Action, Habermas moves further
away from the Paradigm of consciousnesscentered reason to the paradigm of language (as
speech). This shift is designed to provide his
critical theory of society with new normative
foundations, instead of the a priori postulations
of his earlier work. In communication, by entering speech, where at least one speaker and one
hearer are present, we do not simply utter sentences but we also simultaneously relate to the
objective world, to other members in society,
and to our inner private thoughts, feelings, and
desires, by making claims in these three dimensions. In actual life we use language at a performative level. The validity of such claims (which
Habermas distinguishes correspondingly between

reproduced in terms of communicative rationality, instrumental action prevails in the systems.
The imperatives of the system penetrate the lifeworld and, conversely, the systems depend on
the accomplishments of the lifeworld (individual
skills, mass loyalty). While Marx had held a very
linear view between Base and superstructure,
Habermas shows the interactive relation of lifeworld and social system. He calls “colonization
of the lifeworld” the case when the intervention
of the systems produces disturbances to lifeworld’s
reproduction. They are seen as pathologies and
are manifested as loss of meaning, anomie, and
personality disorder.
But who are the agents and the forms of protest in areas of social conflict today? According
to Habermas, all protest movements issue from
the colonization of the lifeworld, whenever it
has been ruptured or is endangered by external
systemic forces. All protest groups can be characterized as resistances to the tendencies of colonization of the lifeworld, and an emancipatory
potential is visible in those which pursue new
forms of social life in cooperation and community. The decolonization of the lifeworld does
not dictate its isolation from all modernization.
The more communicatively rationalized the
lifeworld, the better the chance for developing
institutionalized resistances which can limit the
destructive function of systemic forces. The
public sphere is the central place for agreements
to be reached discursively.
Drawing from Weber, Habermas delineates a
theory of Modernity (Habermas, 1981; English
translation 1984). Modern society can be viewed
as the outcome of the rationalization of the
lifeworld and differentiation of social systems.
Nevertheless, modernization of the lifeworld has
resulted in its splitting into three value spheres
(science, morality, and art). Habermas explains the
“dark side” of modernity as the outcome of onesided and distorted rationalizations. In modern
societies the sphere of science has been given
a privileged position, as scientific–technological
rationality, over the spheres of art and morality.
He believes that the “unfinished project of modernity” requires a new cultural tradition based on the
reintegration of all these three spheres of life
(Habermas, 1983b).
Concerning Hermeneutics, as in earlier projects, it plays a vital role in Habermas’s approach.

Communicative action is bound to interpretation.
In the model of speaker/hearer which Habermas
provides for the performative function of language,
both participants stand in an interpretative relation. The need for hermeneutics extends into
everyday life since its most ordinary features
have become strange. Hermeneutic employment
in the social sciences is the normal case. However,
the use of hermeneutics should not be permitted
to lead to any sort of relativism. The social
sciences should be both objective and theoretical. This condition, Habermas believes, can be
achieved by a “negotiated impartiality” gained
from the interpreter’s position.
In the sphere of Ethics Habermas proposes
his theory of Discourse ethics which intends to
replace the Kantian categorical imperative. He takes
moral argumentation to be distinct from other
forms of argumentation in the sense that it is
not about the validity of truth claims; instead it
aims at establishing whether human actions and
the norms governing them are right.
The basic idea behind discourse ethics (which
Habermas calls principle (D)) is that norms are
valid only when they meet or could meet with the
approval of all affected in their role as participants
in a practical discourse. This principle indicates
the procedural character of solving moral problems within argumentative boundaries.
However, the whole idea of a discourse ethics
(especially the condition that a norm must be met
with general approval) is not arbitrary, neither
should it be taken simply as a suggestive gesture.
It relies upon a more profound and universal principle (which Habermas borrows from Mead).
According to this principle, every valid norm
must fulfill a certain condition: all affected by it
can accept freely the consequences and its side
effects which can be anticipated to occur in its
implementation for the satisfaction of everyone’s
interest. Habermas proposes this principle as
a rule of argumentation (principle (U)), which
strengthens and explicates his terms of discourse
ethics.
He argues that principle (U) does not resemble
the Kantian a priori fashioned categorical imperative; instead it is a transcendental-pragmatic
consideration of universal and necessary presupposition of argumentation. That is, if we
are bound to argumentation and its communicative dimensions for reaching agreement and

321
life forms and can be accepted as valid or refuted
as invalid. The upshot of his moral theory is that
Habermas abandons the idea of moral truths as
values, and reinstates them as learned knowledge
and competences acquired in the social evolution
of the species.
Undoubtedly, the breadth of Habermas’s projects since the 1960s is enormous. His voice of
critical resistance has been strongly anchored to
the premise of communicative rationality. Not
everyone, though, shares the same convictions.
Those who believe that the employment of
(unified) reason in social life (as the completion
of the Modernity project) is the prime task
today will find in Habermas’s proposals a potent
ally. Those who are skeptical and have observed
the narratives of modernity fading away will find
in Habermas a powerful opponent to test the
strength of their arguments.
It is true that the weight of his hope lies with
the social sciences, which can undertake the task
of objective knowledge in reconstructive research
programs. Philosophy has been seen to collaborate with the sciences, undertaking the task of
developing a more advanced theory of rationality. For these reasons his theses are certain to
be discussed by sociological, anthropological,
and political disciplines, and partly in social
and political philosophy. However, his theses
on communicative rationality and particularly
his latest attempts on discourse ethics are bound
to attract considerable discussion in traditional
departments of philosophy, as well as in literary
and Cultural studies.
It is also fair to him to mention the following.
In his discourse ethics an uneasy tension of a
twofold dichotomy develops. The reformulated
Kantian categorical imperative (taken as a rule for
entering argumentation) underlines the formalism of his theory. On the other hand, substantive
issues cannot be met by his theory and are left to
be solved by the (hopefully developed) cognitive
moral capacities of the participants in argumentation. The balance here is critical and we may
ask whether we are in a better position to solve
substantive moral issues than before.
Habermas continually attempts to retain
together the historical (contingent) and the universal (as is the case with his reconstructive
sciences). He is caught in an unresolved contradictory position, although it has also become

Habermas, Jürgen

understanding, then there is no other identifiable alternative to sustain such argumentation,
except for principle (U). He believes that principle (U) offers a universally valid ethics, and
does not depend on the reflections and intuitions
of a particular Culture and epoch. On the
other hand, his ethical theory does not provide
solutions to moral issues; it only indicates the
procedural steps for substantive matters to be
resolved. Concrete moral dilemmas and moral
conflicts should be solved within argumentation
which participants enter freely and in an equal
cooperative relationship for the search of truth.
The only recognizable force here is “the force
of better argument.”
The historicity and high relativism of solutions of moral issues are evident if Habermas’s
propositions remain at this level. For him discourse
ethics is basically a reconstructive science which,
in anthropological terms, views the human agent
equipped with moral competences, and morality
as a safety device for the vulnerability of the
individual in sociocultural forms of life. Such
vulnerability arises from the tension which
develops between the growth of the personal
identity of the individual, and his simultaneous
exposure and dependence upon interpersonal
relations and social ties. Moralities are formed
to protect both the individual (his dignity), and
the web of intersubjective relations necessary for
survival within the community. Thus the conceptions of justice (equal rights and respect for
the individual) and solidarity (addressed to the
well-being of the community) are formed.
Following Lawrence Kohlberg’s theory of the
development of moral consciousness, Habermas
not only seeks confirmation for the scientific
reconstruction of the moral competences of the
individual, but he also envisages the (ambitious)
program of the phylogenetic moral development
of the species. In this course of construction,
it could be shown that universal forms of moral
judgment prevail, and that the structural differences between moralities could be attributed to
different stages of moral capacity, thus avoiding
cultural and historical relativism.
Using Kohlberg’s theory of moral competences
as background, Habermas suggests that entering
discourse on the validity of a norm is similar to
that of validating truth claims. Social norms are
transformed into possibilities of regulation of

his motor for further reformulations and research
projects.
Modernity is presented as a unique historical
project for the human species, since further
rationalization of the lifeworld based on communicative rationality can guarantee the promise
of Enlightenment: a life informed by reason.
According to Habermas there is no other clear
alternative. The Hegelian inbuilt teleology of
this model is apparent. One can appreciate the
context of Lyotard’s criticism against a unified
goal of history and a totalizing subject (integrating the three spheres of life) inherent in
Habermas’s project (see Lyotard, 1979).
His model of communicative action juxtaposing speaker and bearer in conversation appears
as an “innocent” exchange of statements, underlined by the aim of agreement and understanding. In such a discourse, no forces, no power
relations, no antagonisms enter, and, to many, this
basic hypothesis for a reconstructive science of
communicative action would appear as a nonpragmatic conception, but rather as an ideal,
deontological, and attractive proposition.
Habermas’s conception of human life, although
successfully embedded in the lifeworld, is dictated
by sociological, scientific, universal principles.
This conception cannot exhaust the function of
language (for example, metaphoric speech, poetic
language), rich cultural histories, or reconstruct
the history of the human species based solely on
cognitive processes and developmental stages
of learned capacities. His views (notwithstanding
their dynamic explanatory force and ability to
guide research programs) register as a restricted
view of human history. A reflective acquaintance
with literature, philosophy, and cultural studies
could easily show that life forms are many times
richer, yet intrinsically more dominated, than
the premises of Habermas’s theory would allow.

`Hall, Stuart (1932–) 
British sociologist/
cultural theorist. Hall’s contribution to the field
of British cultural studies is far-reaching and
intertwined with the histories of the Centre for
Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham (where he was the director
during the 1970s, as well as being an editor of
the New Left Review from 1957 to 1961), and
the trajectory of the New left in Britain. One
genealogy of Cultural studies locates itself
in the debate between the socialist Humanism
of Williams, Hoggart, and Thompson and
traditional Marxist approaches to contemporary
cultural politics. British cultural studies emerges
as a dialogue between humanistic Marxism,
which Hall call “culturalism,” and the antihumanism of Althusser’s structural Marxism
through a new reading of Antonio Gramsci (see
Grossberg, 1989, p. 119).
As one of the leading black intellectuals in
postwar Britain, Hall’s extensive writings have
emerged out of a political and intellectual commitment of Marxism to offer a materialist theory
of Ideology and Discourse that draws upon
Psychoanalysis and Deconstruction. As a
major theorist of the politics of contemporary
British Culture and society, Hall’s collaborations
with different groups as well as his own contributions have produced some of the most
influential theories of the nature of cultural and
historical specificity. While there were numerous
influences, political struggles, questions, and forms
of collective work that shaped and extended
Hall’s writings beyond the confines of traditional
left inquiry, his own work reflects the complex
ways in which Race intersects with Gender and
Class relations in the larger intellectual formation of British Marxism.

Harris is often dismissed as being of historical
interest. Structuralist linguistics is taken as dead
and buried, Chomsky now rules OK, and discourse
analysis uses completely different methods from
those pioneered by Harris. In fact, Harris continued to produce important and original work
until quite recently (cf. Harris, 1982). Unfortunately, his work ignores virtually everything
in the field except research by himself and his
close colleagues. The unfamiliar assumptions and
terminology in his work have in turn meant that
everyone else in the field has tended to ignore
Harris. Anyone who does not think this is a pity
should read Harris’s masterly paper on Sapir
(Harris, 1972), clearly the work of an outstanding mind (see Sapir, Edward).

1951 book Methods in Structural Linguistics is

Second, he introduced Chomsky to linguistics

the most important of the critics who announced
and promoted the emergence of Postmodernism
in literature. The first significant work of this
kind was his The Dismemberment of Orpheus:
Toward a Postmodern Literature (1971) (1982), in
which he argued that literary postmodernism is
a continuation and intensification of the “will to
unmaking” to be found in modernist artists and
writers. Later works such as Paracriticisms (1975)
and The Right Promethean Fire (1980) engage with
more general issues in contemporary Culture,
such as the role of science in a postmodern age,
and, drawing eclectically on a wide range of
disciplines and authorities, attempt to forge a
“multivocal” style of critical writing, employing
dialogue, collage, and typographical invention to
match the postmodernist condition that is their
subject. His The Postmodern Turn (1987) gathers
together essays on postmodernism written from
1967 to 1987.

`Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich (1770–1831) 
German philosopher. In 1818 Hegel was
called to a chair in philosophy in Berlin in order
to quell the revolutionary spirits of students
inspired by the French Revolution. In one of the
ironies of history, which Hegel made it his life work
to discern, a more “revolutionary” philosopher
could hardly have been found to quash a revolution. It is not at all implausible to claim that Hegel
was the most influential philosopher in world
history. If nothing else, his great critic, Karl
marx, created an Ideology from Hegelianism
that convulsed the entire world for more than
a century.
Hegel was the first philosopher to write a
work entitled “philosophy of history” and the
core of his genius lies in the discovery of history
as a category for philosophical thought. The
“discovery” of history constituted a radical break
with virtually the whole of the Western philosophical tradition. Not only has philosophy
never been quite the same since, but also Hegel’s
historical “method” deeply influenced everything
from theology to basic conceptions of political and
social life.
Philosophy – and almost all other intellectual
efforts prior to Hegel – was based on the model
of natural science. True knowledge has traditionally been associated with “the universal.” In
biology, the investigator is not interested in the
particular individual at hand, but in the universal
character of the species. In moral philosophy,
one is interested in “the nature of humanity,”
not John Smith (or Pocahontas) as a universal
standard for ethical behavior. Hegel insisted that
the real was historical; the supposed universal
truth asserted, the general nature discovered,
was a function of some specific historical
Culture.

By emphasizing the historical character of truth,
Hegel became the spiritual father of such modern
movements as Existentialism and Deconstruction. Existentialism with its insistence that
“existence precedes essence” (Sartre) asserts that
morality must be “created” from the particular life
of the historical individual since there is no
moral essence which intervenes. Deconstruction
revels in what Jacques Derrida calls the “dance
of innumerable choreographies,” the historically rooted nature of various beliefs and values.
Hegel’s notion of history is in the long run
opposed to the use made of it by the aforementioned contemporary philosophies. For Hegel,
history is not just a lively dance of particulars; it
is somehow a connected and “progressive” story.
History (and thought) moves by a “dialectic”
through a series of accomplishments, Alienations, and higher-level reconciliations: thesis,
antithesis, and synthesis in his technical terminology. Marx seized upon the dialectic and
proclaimed that world history was moving
inevitably through this process of alienation and
reconciliation toward a communist society.
An example of simplified Marxist dialectic
may illustrate the process. The initial period of
human artifice is in “manufacture,” literally
hand-making (Communist Manifesto, I). At that
stage of production, the worker and his work are
one. The hand-made object reflects the special skill
and character of the worker. With the advent of
the machine – which increases the productivity
of the worker – the worker is “alienated” from his
product. The machine-made product does not
reflect the worker’s person. The worker does not
master the product, the product rushing down
the assembly line masters the worker. Thus in
an effort to increase the power of the worker
through the use of mechanism, we have in fact
lessened the “power” of the worker by enslaving
him to the machine. We unknowingly create the
antithesis of the original thesis, the alienation of
the original accomplishment.
Analysis of “alienation” à la Hegelian dialectic
is widely practiced, for example, by “pop” psychological and sociological critics, without
recognizing the patrimony of the concept. It is
the ultimate step in the dialectic that has been the
most controversial: the reconciliation or synthesis
of thesis and antithesis “on a higher level.” In
the Marxist interpretation, this would be the

325
Mind! – seized on the earlier works of Hegel
in order to emphasize the historical struggle
embedded in the master’s convoluted description
of the human mind (Geist, spirit). The historical
Hegel reemerged and became the subject of
extensive study.
Finally, “phenomenological” method became
a watchword among German philosophers like
Husserl and Heidegger, but without the dialectical “progress” characteristic of Hegel’s original
formulation. Husserl’s phenomenology relates
more to the epistemological tradition of Descartes, while Heidegger’s “quest for being” has a
meditative and “static” quality incommensurate
with the revolutionary agon embedded in Hegel’s
struggle of the human spirit.
Despite the apparent rejection of the Marxist
“end-of-history” scenario, there have been put
forward deep arguments that Hegel was fundamentally correct: history has in some sense come
to an end. (Alexandre Kojève is the most penetrating of the commentators on this issue. His
American translators and “disciples,” Alan Bloom
and Leo Straus, removed residual Marxism
from Kojève and gave currency to “end-of-history”
analysis for American readers.) For Hegel, history
is a special form of human consciousness. Not all
periods of the past have used historical thinking
to understand their world. History emerges only
when individuals come to a realization of their
basic freedom. Only free individuals can make
(or think) history. The social conditions under
which a recognition of freedom first came forward
were, however, politically oppressive. In the
modern world there appears to be a universal
recognition of individual freedom (the rise of
“democracies”). At that point, social change
continues but the categories of change are no
longer historical. The basic struggle to recognize
individuals is now finished, so whatever oppositions and conflicts occur, they are the working out
of a historical reality already achieved.

reconciliation of the worker with the product
when the workers own the (machine) means of
production. While critics of modern society have
been all too conscious of a variety of alienations,
most solutions have been “regressive,” not “progressive”. In the Communist Manifesto, Marx
and Engels excoriated various romantic utopians
of the day who wished to return to Gothic visions,
the life of simple artisans and sturdy yeoman
farmers. History moves forward inexorably and one
cannot return to earlier and simpler stages of life.
The French Revolution was yet another attempt
to solve the alienation of human history – an alienation which Hegel sees as the origin and engine
of historical existence. The revolution did not seek
to regress in history, but to transcend history
altogether. It was a revolution based on reason and
the rights of man, but, for Hegel, human society
cannot be based on a universalist concept of
humanity discovered by some transcending
scientific reason. Hegel’s view that one cannot
“hurry history” made him the obvious choice for
a chair in “counterrevolutionary” philosophy.
At the same time, however, his allegiance to
historical dialectic projects human history as a
series of radical reversals: the secret alienation
within every reconciliation drives societies to
dissolution and revolt.
While Hegel’s sense of dynamic history seems
everywhere evident in the intellectual methods
of the contemporary world, his ultimate “solution”
appears everywhere rejected. Hegel envisioned
an “end of history,” some final synthesis not
subject to further radical reversal. The history of
Hegelianism can be divided more or less along
the lines of those who accepted the solution and
denied the method or accepted the method and
denied the solution. In the nineteenth century,
British idealists, as represented by F.H. Bradley,
bypassed the historical development but accepted
the “logical” structure of the dialectic. Experience
was deeply conflicted, mere appearance; reality,
in contrast, lies on the other side of human
conception. Hegel’s work on “logic” was their
fundamental text. With the rejection of idealism at the beginning of the twentieth century
as Empiricism and the reality of experience
were reasserted, it seemed as if Hegelianism
was thoroughly discredited and abandoned. The

`Hegelianism 
Broadly defines various movements influenced by the philosopher Hegel.
Traditionally Hegelianism was split between the
so-called “right” and “left” Hegelians. Right
Hegelians affirmed the anti-transcendent direction
of Hegel’s work: the notion that one must wait out
historical development and not attempt to impose
some rational utopia on human society. Left
Hegelians, on the other hand, were impressed with
the radical Alienations and disruptions which
marked Hegel’s view of history; they postulated
inevitable revolutions, perhaps a final revolution
which would solve the conflicts of human society.

`hegemony 
Derived from the Greek word
hegemDn (leader, commander, guide, ruler), hegemony has generally been used (by both Marxist
and non-Marxist thinkers) to refer to either
political domination or leadership. It acquires
a more specific import in the work of Antonio
Gramsci, who, developing Marx’s own insights,
argues that the economic and political ascendancy
of a given Class is organically connected with a
preparatory achievement of cultural and intellectual hegemony. The intellectuals sympathetic
to this class have an organizational function: to
articulate the world view of the class, thereby
giving it a unity and consciousness of its aims; to
help structure social institutions in accordance with
these aims; and to foster an environment of consent to the ideas of the class. Taking cognizance
of this, a socialist revolution must have its path
prepared by its own core of intellectuals who, by
galvanizing the working masses into a politically
self-conscious agency and working toward institutional and individual acceptance of its ideas,
develop an alternative hegemony (rather than
relying on coercion by the state). The notion of
hegemony thus embodies a more dialectical connection between superstructure and economic
base than that allowed by a deterministic reading
of Marx, which sees historical change and revolution as generated necessarily by developments at
the economic level.

`Heidegger, Martin (1889–1976) 
A student
of Husserl’s, whose chair at Freiburg he was to
inherit, Heidegger is increasingly perceived, with
Wittgenstein, as one of the two most influential philosophers of the twentieth century.
Most movements in European thought since –
Existentialism, Hermeneutics, Poststructuralism, for instance – bear the mark of his
thinking, as do much contemporary theology,
environmental philosophy, and “deconstructionist” Literary Criticism.
As with Wittgenstein, it is necessary to distinguish between an “early” and a “later” Heidegger,
before and after his so-called turn (Kehre) during
the 1930s. Heidegger’s contribution, and the effect
of his “turn,” are best understood through three
related themes which, despite radical modulation,
remain constant throughout his voluminous writings and lectures. Much of Heidegger’s power
stems from the intriguing interweaving, within
these themes, of philosophical abstraction and
concrete critique of the modern condition.
The first theme is that, despite its usual suppression, the central philosophy issue is “the
question of being.” Being is neither the sum total
of particular beings, nor their common property,
nor a special kind of being (God, say), but that
through which all beings are made possible. In the
early Being and Time of 1927, Heidegger claims
that we are brought to a sense of being through,
ironically, those “moods” like Angst when particular beings fade into insignificance or “nothingness.” Heidegger’s approach is to delineate
various modes of being through phenomenological reflection on the experiences of those
creatures, ourselves, whose own being is an
“issue” for them. But the task of moving from this
to a characterization of being as such was left
uncompleted, the later explanation being that
the approach had been too anthropocentric,
too “humanistic” (1978, V). Indeed, Heidegger
comes to see the history of Western metaphysics
– of Western civilization, in fact – as the story of
a “forgetfulness of being” due to the hubristic,
though pardonable, attempt to represent and
measure reality through human constructs. The

327
the mutually dependent dispensations of a mysterious “Event” (Ereignis, 1972)).
The final theme is that human existence, at
least in modernity, is “out of tune” with its true
essence. In Being and Time, Dasein is said to live,
for the most part, “inauthentically.” Absorbed
in particular objects and pursuits, “tranquilized”
in the conventional ways of the anonymous
“Them” (Das Man), reiterating the clichés of
the day in “idle chatter,” people rarely, if ever,
summon themselves to that “resoluteness” which
would authentically register their status as individual sources of meaning and “care.” Authentic
individuality, nevertheless, is possible only for
people infused with the traditions of a genuine
community. Heidegger’s belief that National
Socialism would realize an ideal of tradition and
community helps explain his temporary allegiance
to the NSDAP. (The Party facilitated his election
as Rector of Freiburg University in 1923.)
Another reason for the Nazi affiliation was
what Heidegger saw as the movement’s agrarian
resistance to industrialization and technology,
for his own hostility toward these tendencies
was soon to inform most of his later work. The
technological attitude, indeed, now becomes for
Heidegger the primary manifestation of man’s
Alienation from his true nature. Man’s essential
“destiny” is to “shepherd” being, to “let being be.”
However, technology, as the will to power in
action, is the culmination of the “forgetfulness of
being.” It orders the world to human material
requirements, putting everything “on tap” as
“standing reserve” (Bestand), without regard for
the intrinsic natures of rivers, fields, animals,
or whatever (1978, VII). For “salvation” from the
technological stance, Heidegger turns increasingly toward Art. A painting, like Van Gogh’s
of the peasant’s shoes, brings out and recalls us
to the integrity of things, displaying their proper
place in relation to the earth, to ourselves, and
even to the gods (1978, IV ). But, above all, it
is the poets, like Hölderlin and Trakl, who can
reinaugurate our atrophied sense of being. Poetic
language is the “house of being.” By patiently
“listening to the call of being,” the poet may
then give human voice to what is intimated; and
we, in our turn, listening to the poet, may then
accommodate to the “command of Being” and
fulfill our “destiny” as “shepherds” (1971). (Few
will demur from George Steiner’s remark that

Heidegger, Martin

final, “nihilistic” chapter of the story is Nietzsche’s denial of being in favor of a “becoming,”
identified with the strivings of an anthropomorphically conceived “will to power.” Hubris
reaches its apogee in the Übermensch. What
makes the “forgetfulness of being” pardonable is
that responsibility for it rests with being itself.
Heidegger now portrays being as a “presencing”
which lurks concealed behind the beings which
it has allowed to become present for us, and
which we then submit to our representational
schemes.
The second persistent theme is the uniqueness
of human existence, Dasein (“being-there”). A
main target in Being and Time are those scientific
and philosophical views, like those of Descartes,
in which humans are treated as objects alongside
other physical objects, distinguished primarily
by their also being Subjects of perception. This
view, argues Heidegger, misconstrues both Dasein
and the character of things in the world. These
latter are not, in the first instance, encountered
as mere perceptual objects or material substance,
but as “equipment” and “ready-to-hand”: that is,
as items which owe their identities to the places
they occupy within such human activities as
farming. Regarding a plough, or indeed a tree, as
a physical substance is a secondary, derivative
way of encountering things. Dasein, meanwhile,
is no “ego-object,” like Descartes’s cogito, but
intentional activity, a “project.” Always “ahead
of itself,” it is intelligible only through its future
oriented engagement with the world, not
through some set of intrinsic causal properties.
Since the world is intelligible only through this
human engagement or “care” (Sorge), it follows
that the relation between world and Dasein is
not contingent and causal. Neither is even thinkable without the other. In the later writings,
the rather Promethean emphasis on man as an
activity diminishes, his uniqueness now being
due to a special “destiny” as the “shepherd of
Being.” “Being-there” is no longer being “out
there,” engaged in the world, but being the
“there,” the “clearing,” where being “presences.”
Being still requires man, no longer because
things only have their “equipmental” identities
within the field of human “care,” but because, to
realize its essence as presencing, there must be
an audience for what is made present. (In some
very late articles, Being and man are depicted as

hermeneutics

328
Heidegger reads poetry like no one else (Steiner,
1979).)
The mystical tone in these later writings
is unmistakable. (Reading a book on Zen,
Heidegger apparently remarked that here was
what he had been striving to express for years.)
Admirers of Being and Time may, like Sartre,
find this tone unappealing. Those to whom it does
appeal may endorse Heidegger’s own opinion
of Being and Time as a work still in thrall to a metaphysical tradition whose overthrow would, quite
literally, be our salvation in this “destitute age.”

`hermeneutics 
The art or technique of interpretation. The history of hermeneutics goes back
to the ancient Greeks. The name was (via a
probably false etymology) thought of as deriving
from that of the messenger god Hermes. The
development of a defined area of modern theory
termed hermeneutics out of the practice of
scriptural interpretation was predominantly the
work of Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834),
Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911), Martin Heidegger
(1889–1976), and Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–).
In recent theory hermeneutics has often been
regarded as an approach to Texts that is no
longer methodologically defensible. Poststructuralism sees itself as renouncing hermeneutics’
metaphysical goal of finding the text’s original
meaning. Jacques Derrida contrasts “two interpretations of interpretation”: one – hermeneutics
– “seeks to decipher, dreams of deciphering a truth
or an origin that escapes the play and the order
of the sign, and lives the necessity of interpretation like an exile”; the other – a deconstructive
conception informed by Nietzsche’s claim that
truth is the repressive reduction of the infinite
diversity of particular intuitions to forms of

identity – “affirms play and tries to go beyond man
and humanism” (Derrida, 1967b, p. 427). Meaning for Derrida is not a stable origin prior to the
signifier, or a goal beyond it, but is dependent
upon the inherently unstable signifier. However, this polemical contrast of hermeneutics
and Deconstruction obscures the complexity
of the question of interpretation in the history
of modern hermeneutics.
Hermeneutics has nearly always involved a
tension between the idea that the interpreting
Subject should surrender to the transformative
power of the text and the idea that the meaning of a Text can only emerge via the creative
initiatives of its interpreters. The former notion
has a long history in various traditions of theology. The latter notion emerges most clearly in
the Romantic movement, where it derives from
Fichte’s radicalization of Kant’s insight into the
role of the spontaneity of the subject in the constitution of a knowable world (see Bowie, 1990,
chapter 3). Many of the debates over hermeneutics
can be seen as playing out some version of this
tension, which is also fundamental to twentiethcentury philosophy. Gottlob Frege and the
tradition of analytical philosophy that develops
from his work see meaning, for example, as determined by the medium of communication rather
than by the consciousness of the individual subject. Recent directions in literary theory and
European philosophy see the role of the subject
in the understanding of texts as subverted by the
subject’s failure to be present to itself, because
of the incursion of language, in the form of
“tradition” (Gadamer), différance (Derrida), or the
“symbolic order” (Lacan), into the very structure
of subjectivity. Does meaning, then, derive from
the text or from its reception? Is the interpreter
subject to language or master of it? Such questions go to the heart of modern philosophy.
Kant’s problems with the question of judgment are central to the development of modern
hermeneutics. In the Critique of Pure Reason
(1781) Kant saw judgment as the “capacity to
subsume under rules.” He realizes, though, that
there cannot be rules for the application of the
rule to the particular case, for this would lead
to an infinite regress. Judgment must therefore
depend upon the prior “schematizing” capacity
of the understanding, which gives an initial coherence to experience before it can be subsumed into

329
of the human sciences to the level of positive
knowledge of the natural sciences was already
potentially undermined by Nietzsche’s doctrine
of “perspectivism” in his work in the 1880s. For
Nietzsche “interpretation” becomes the fundamental manner in which the “will to power”
functions, and is therefore the basis of all forms
in the manifest world: “The will to power interprets:
in the constitution of an organ it is a question
of an interpretation” (Nietzsche, 1980, vol. 12,
p. 139). The will to power’s “self-interpretation”
in the form of determinate manifestations, from
inanimate objects, to organisms, to signifiers, is
actually a version of the Romantic notion, present in the work of Schleiermacher, Friedrich
Schlegel, and Novalis, and developed in aspects
of the Schelling’s critique of Hegel, that the
absolute cannot be grasped from within the
world of articulable knowledge (see Frank, 1984,
(1989); Bowie, 1990, chapter 8). In Nietzsche’s
version of this position, the “will to power”
becomes the self-interpreting ground of the finite
manifest world. This ground can never appear as
itself (which means, of course, that even giving
it a name like the “will to power” is a problem)
and must constantly interpret itself by becoming
finite, thereby failing to be present as itself.
It is from conceptions of this nature, which
reject the idea of truth in language as correspondence to reality, that the reformulation of the
“hermeneutic circle” in the work of Heidegger
develops. Given the structural impossibility of
thought ever being able to encompass its own
relationship to its ground, Heidegger regards
the circularity of self-interpretation as inescapable. Interpretation is fundamental to being in
the world, and cannot be understood from an
extramundane position. Any interpretation,
including explanation in the natural sciences,
depends upon the fact that what is interpreted
must already be understood or “disclosed” for
it to be put into question at all. As such: “The
decisive factor is not to get out of the circle but
to get into it in the right way (Heidegger, 1927
(1980), p. 153). As opposed to being a transcendental Subject confronted with a world of
alien objects that it must interpret, Dasein is
always already situated in an interpreted world.
This world is constituted by the hermeneutic
“as-structure of understanding” that precedes
the “apophantic ‘as’ of the proposition” (ibid.,

hermeneutics

judgments (see Bell, 1987). Kant distinguishes
in the Critique of Judgment between judgments
of particulars based on a preexisting general rule
(“determinant judgments”) and those based on
trying to establish a rule in relation to the particular (“reflective judgments”). This distinction
points to Friedrich Ast’s idea of the “hermeneutic
circle” (1808), in which the parts of the text to
be understood depend on the understanding of
the whole, and vice versa. The fact that Kant’s
distinction cannot ultimately be sustained is at the
root of the development of both Schleiermacher’s
and subsequent hermeneutics. Schleiermacher
shows that even in the case of a determinant
judgment the application depends upon a prior
contextual understanding which cannot be derived
from a rule. The resistance of interpretation to any
codification in the form of rules is essential to the
varying versions of modern hermeneutics, and
had, until the advent of W.V. Quine’s, Donald
Davidson’s, and Hilary Putnam’s “holism”,
most clearly distinguished hermeneutic accounts
of meaning from accounts of semantics in
analytical philosophy.
According to Gadamer’s history of hermeneutics, however, Schleiermacher and then Dilthey
reinforce the subjectivist aspect brought into philosophy by Kant’s epistemology and Aesthetics.
This subjectivism is supposedly evident in the
notion of Einfühlung, “empathy” with the producer
of the text by its interpreter. Schleiermacher
himself, though, never uses the word Einfühlung,
and what he means by “divination,” the word
he does use, is what children do when they learn
language on the basis of having no prior rules,
and what we do in making judgments despite
the lack of determining rules of application (see
Frank, 1977; Bowie, 1990, chapter 6). Gadamer’s
argument also ignores the role of J.G. Hamann’s
linguistic critique of Kant in 1784 in the development of Romantic thought (see Bowie, 1990,
chapter 6).
The most influential aspect of the work of
Dilthey is really his distinction between understanding, Verstehen, which is characteristic of
the human sciences, and explanation, Erklären,
which defines the natural sciences. The questioning of this distinction in this century has led
to the revaluation of hermeneutics in contemporary theory. The defensive attitude evident in
Dilthey’s attempt to raise the historical claims

hermeneutics

p. 158). Heidegger’s early writings thus echo the
stress on prepredicative understanding present
in Schleiermacher’s appropriation of Kant’s
“schema,” as well as carrying on the refusal in
German idealism and Romanticism to conceive
of the subject as separate from the object world.
For Heidegger Dasein is that being that can
relate to its own being. As such it “ex-ists” in
a way that other beings (Seiendes) do not.
Heidegger’s reformulation of hermeneutics is
part of his attempted “destruction” of ontology
in the tradition of Western metaphysics. “Being”
(Sein) for Heidegger cannot be understood as
objective existence in relation to the knowing
subject. The notion of the presence of the object
to the subject’s direct intuition differs from the
affirmation or negation of an (already interpreted)
state of affairs in a proposition. The ontological
difference of beings (Seiendes) and being (Sein)
can best be understood as the difference between
the merely contingent (and uncommunicable)
existence of objects for individual consciousness
and the truth about the world of interpreted
states of affairs that is revealed in the moving structure of understanding something as something that
is articulated in language (see Manfred Frank in
Wood, 1992, pp. 218–34, and Tugendhat, 1992,
pp. 57–65 and 108–35). The question of being
for Heidegger is, then, inseparable from language.
Heidegger’s major contribution to hermeneutics is his identification of a tension between a
hermeneutic conception of truth as the happening of “world disclosure” that we experience, for
example, when art reveals the world in ways that
cannot be propositionally stated, and the notion
of truth as warranted assertability in propositions. The effects of such a tension can be seen
in the new developments in the history of science
associated with Thomas Kuhn, Michel Foucault,
and others, as well as in the work of “postanalytical” philosophers like Richard Rorty
and, in his recent work, Hilary Putnam, where
the role of hermeneutic experience even in the
natural sciences is seen as vital.
The most influential development of
Heidegger’s ideas has been the work of his pupil
Gadamer. In Truth and Method Gadamer
investigates the tension between a hermeneutic
understanding of truth as “disclosure,” which
he sees in the continuing relevance of the great
works of Western art, and the “method” of the

natural sciences. In line with both Nietzsche’s
and Heidegger’s anti-subjectivism, as well as
with the Lutheran notion of the transformative
power of the text, Gadamer insists on the fact that
the subject is always already located in language
and tradition: “Being that can be understood is
language” (Gadamer, 1975, p. 450). Language
itself is ichlos (“self-less”); understanding is the
movement of the individual into the happening of intersubjective “tradition.” The power of
Gadamer’s position lies in its valorization of
the open encounter with the “Other,” whether
simply as other people, great Art, or other
Cultures, which is able to transform the subject who engages with that other. He sees the
alternative to this open encounter as the objectification of what is to be understood in the
manner of the objectifications of natural science.
The power of his position is, however, itself
bought at the expense of a series of Reifications
of the kind suggested in the later Heidegger’s
notion that “Language speaks. Man speaks to the
extent to which he corresponds to language”
(Heidegger, 1959, pp. 32–3), or in Derrida’s
assertion that the subject is an “effect” of the “general text” (Derrida, 1972a, p. 122). Gadamer’s
position is questionable because new revelations
and understandings of being are effectively seen
as the work of language itself, rather than of
its individual speakers. While the acceptance of
new revelations must take place via linguistic
agreement, this is no explanation of the genesis
of such new revelation, which cannot derive
from language itself.
It is against this tendency to reification in the
hermeneutic tradition deriving from Heidegger,
as well as in poststructuralism and analytical
philosophy, that the work of Manfred Frank is
directed. For Frank the reification characteristic
of so much twentieth-century theory of language
is a result of taking one approach to subjectivity
in Western philosophy as the only possible
approach. Following the German Romantics
and Sartre, Frank does not see the subject as
master of language, but avoids the reification
of locating meaning in the code rather than in
those who understand and articulate via the
code. The critique of the Cartesian “Paradigm
of subjectivity,” in which an isolated subject
tries to cross the gap between self and not-self,
is common to thinkers as diverse as Heidegger,

`heteroglossia 
A term introduced by the
Soviet semiotician and cultural theorist Mikhail
Bakhtin. It is derived from the two Greek words
for “other” and “language,” thus yielding the
sense: “that within Discourse which cannot be
reduced to the order of any single, self-authorized
voice or code.” Bakhtin developed a sociological
poetics which rejected both the formalist emphasis
on static (ahistorical) structures and stylistic
devices and also those modes of social-realist
criticism that stressed the importance of historical
context but ignored the specificity of literary
language. He sought to steer a path between and
beyond these opposed temptations by devising
a typology of discourse genres that would link
the distinctive formal features of various kinds of
Text to their conditions of cultural production
and reception.
Thus it is Bakhtin’s view that no Sign System
is entirely self-enclosed, since each and every
utterance takes rise from a heteroglossic multitude
of meanings, values, social discourses, cultural
Codes, etc. In some genres – for instance, lyric
poetry or autobiography – there is a countervailing stress on “private” (first-person) expression,
and hence a clearly marked generic drive to contain or restrict this centrifugal movement. The
same may apply to prose writing during periods
of authoritarian rule when language is subject
to a strict policing of its otherwise subversive
potential. However, sometimes this produces
just the opposite effect, as Bakhtin brings out
in his study of Dostoevsky. For the novel is of all
genres the most irrepressibly prone to generate a
range of polyphonic meanings, voices, or subject
positions whose sheer multiplicity cannot be
reduced to any single omniscient narrative viewpoint. It belongs to a tradition – or countertradition – of anarchic and irreverent humor
whose origins Bakhtin discovers in a certain
(noncanonical) reading of the Socratic dialogues,

heteroglossia

Ryle, and Habermas. Such a subject must
necessarily fail to cross the gap between the self
and its other. However, the question remains,
as Frank suggests, as to whether a paradigm in
which this gap is always already crossed via the
intersubjective medium of language does not
repress the irreducible individuality of each
language user, which Schleiermacher saw as the
root of the need for the art of interpretation.
Joel Weinsheimer exemplifies the reification that
Frank opposes when he claims of Gadamer’s
view of interpretation: “To understand is to
interpret, to say what one understands, or more
precisely, to participate in the event in which
the understood interprets itself in language”
(Weinsheimer, 1991, p. 119). Gadamer suggests:
“Every word makes the whole of the language to
which it belongs resonate, and makes the whole
world view that it is based on appear” (Gadamer,
1975, p. 434). As such Gadamer retains an
essentially Hegelian conception of a world which
reflects itself in language, in the form of the
“self-interpretation of being.” This makes language
into an equivalent of Hegel’s Geist, in that the
individual subject only makes sense to the extent
that its meanings are part of an overall process,
in which the part is a self-reflection of the whole.
How, though, can this be known? Who is seeing
the relationship between reflecter and reflected,
language and being? Without an external third
viewpoint one has no right to make assertions
about the identity of language and being that
eliminate the individual subject from that identity. Gadamer’s putting hermeneutics on the
agenda of both European and analytical philosophy is, then, a major achievement, but the
future of hermeneutics will depend upon finding
ways of restoring a chastened but still active
subject to the process of interpretation.

and also, more directly, in the late Roman genre
of Mennippian satire. Thereafter it emerges at
irregular intervals, mostly during periods when
a strong (highly centralized) system of state or
church control coexists with a folk-based culture
wherein those dominant values are held up to
mockery through forms of parodic inversion.
Such is the carnivalesque mode of Writing – the
topsy-turvy realm of meanings, priorities, social
distinctions, religious and secular power structures,
etc. – as Bakhtin presents it in his best-known
work, Rabelais and His World. Heteroglossia is one
name for this vision of a language everywhere
traversed by the energies of popular protest and
instinctual desire.

`high culture 
A term which (according to the
Oxford English Dictionary (OED)) began to be used
in the middle of the nineteenth century to make
two sorts of distinction: in class terms, between
the Culture of the elite and that of the “low”;
and in aesthetic terms, between “serious,” autonomously produced, “true” Art and trivial, commercially produced, “mass” art. In 1849 George
Eliot, the OED’s first source, thus symptomatically
contrasts “high culture” with “feminine culture.”

`historicism 
The theory and practice which
privileges historical explanation on the grounds
that ideas, values, and practices – indeed all
things human – are discrete products of particular Cultures rather than transhistorical

manifestations of essential, universal features of
human identity and society. The precise meaning
of historicism has been sufficiently contested,
by both historicists and their critics, that John
Cannon has recently suggested that this “confused
and confusing word . . . should be abandoned”
(1988, p. 192). Indeed, “historicism” is already
untenable, Cannon claims, because it has become
an exclusively pejorative synonym for determinism, cultural relativism, and the abdication of
objectivity (pp. 193–4). However, this negative
definition neither constitutes a genuine critique
of historicism nor effectively signals its obsolescence. While critics have sometimes attacked
historicism as deterministic (Popper, 1945a,
pp. 76–83), many early historicists explicitly
articulated historicism as a critique of absolutist
conceptions of value and knowledge. Moreover,
cultural and epistemological relativism are the
very aspects of the “old historicism” that recent
new historicisms in both literary and historical
studies have revived and radicalized.
Early twentieth-century German historicism,
which emerged from an inchoate nineteenthcentury historicism (Iggers, 1973, pp. 456–60),
rejected the positivistic assimilation of the past
to general laws. Ernst Troeltsch (1923) sought
instead to recover past cultures as “always-new
and always-peculiar individualisations” (p. 14).
Friedrich Meinecke defined historicism as “a
process of individualising observation” (1936,
p. lv); and, because it admits of the “endless
variety” of cultures, historicism and “relativism
. . . belong together” (p. 486). Karl Mannheim’s
historicist sociology incorporated historicism’s
cultural relativism and elaborated its epistemological relationism: “all historical knowledge is
relational knowledge, and can only be formulated with reference to the position of the
observer” (1929, p. 71). Historicism necessarily
undermines “objective historical knowledge”:
because all human endeavors are historically
contingent, any historian’s account of the past
must reflect a particular cultural perspective.
Cultural and epistemological relativism – Mannheim’s distinction between relativism and
relationism notwithstanding – constituted a
“crisis of historicism” for some historicists
(for example, Troeltsch), but historicism –
despite challenges from Structuralism (LéviStrauss, 1962), Marxism (Althusser, 1965a), and

333
“spirit of the age” but as a particular representation shaped within a heterogeneous culture
(Greenblatt, 1982; Dollimore, 1985).
The new historicisms critically reshape the
universal subject and Zeitgeist as “the elite subject” and “hegemonic ideology.” Oppositionalist
historians have long remarked the way traditional
history reproduces hegemonic culture’s effacement
of marginalized agents and discourses. (Gates
(1990) and others have critiqued the same phenomenon in literary history and Canon formation.) In early studies of racism and slavery,
Afro-American historians historicized orthodox
history as a function of contemporary racist
politics (see Du Bois, 1935; Franklin, 1957), but
they believed a corrective, activist objectivism
could recover the “truth” of the past and achieve
“justice in history” (Franklin, 1957, p. 47). By contrast, Thomas Holt (1986) rethinks racist history
as an epistemological problem: “the biases that left
slaves, as people, out of the history of slavery were
not simply racial. They more often had to do with.
. . . how knowledge, or fact itself, was defined”
(p. 7). Yet knowledge, Holt claims, is “a function
of where we stand” and “where we stand is a function of our political and social relations” (p. 7).
Thus, for the poststructuralist historicist, epistemological relativism and politics intersect.
Nevertheless, history writing is political not
only because it is shaped by present politics but
also because the “dissemination of new histories
is political action with historical consequences”
(Holt, 1986, p. 1). Poststructuralist historicism conceives history as action rather than epistemology
(see Hunt, 1991) because it claims that historians produce knowledge about the past rather
than recover the past’s “truth” (see Scott, 1988,
p. 9). History, Scott argues, “is not purely referential but is rather constructed by the historian”
(1989, p. 681). Thus conceived, history is
powerful – rather than accurate or inaccurate –
because knowledge about the past helps to construct knowledge in and for the present (Scott,
1988, p. 2), and knowledge, according to Foucault,
is power (1977a). Scott thus argues that because
the historian’s “representations of the past help
construct gender for the present” (p. 2), critical
analyses of gender in the “past and present [are]
a continuous operation” (p. 6). Contemporary
objectivists find in such claims an indulgent
imposition of the historian’s “reality” at the

historicism

quantitative history – has been vital in Europe
since the 1930s.
By contrast, historicism has remained well
outside the objectivist mainstream of the AngloAmerican historical profession, despite its early
influence on Charles Beard and Carl Becker
(LaCapra, 1985, pp. 20–32; Novick, 1988,
pp. 28–31, 155–8). Since 1970, however, a distinctly poststructuralist historicism has emerged.
For example, scholars of women’s, minority,
and gay and lesbian history have opened a historical front of the poststructuralist critique of
“the transcendent Subject.” Following Michel
Foucault’s claim that “nothing in man – not even
his body” escapes “the influence of history”
(1971a, p. 153), historians and critics have argued
that aspects of identity previously assumed to be
natural and essential – for example, Gender
(Davis, 1976; Scott, 1988), Race (Appiah, 1985;
Gates, 1985 and 1990), and sexuality (Foucault,
1976; Boswell, 1982; Halperin, 1989) – are in
fact historically constructed. In literary studies,
Stephen Greenblatt’s study of the “construction
of identity” (1980, p. 7) in Renaissance England
introduced the New historicism’s critique of a
“timeless, cultureless, universal human essence”
(p. 4).
The historicist fracturing of the category of
“the subject” was precipitated by the recuperation
of women, minorities, and marginal culture as
historical subjects – a project pioneered by historians such as W.E.B. Du Bois (1935), Gerda
Lerner (1971), Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie (1975),
and Natalie Zemon Davis (1975). Recently, Joan
Scott has undertaken a historicist pluralizing
of historical agency: traditional histories, she
claims, efface the historical “particularity and
specificity of all human subjects” by figuring the
elite white male as a “universal representative
for the diverse populations of [a] culture” (1983,
p. 25; cf. Huggins, 1986). The new historicisms
thus share poststructuralism’s emphasis on
difference and its “suspicion of closed systems,
totalities, and universals” (Montrose, 1992, p. 393).
By recovering not only differences between cultures but differences within particular cultures, the
new historicisms diverge from the old Rankean
historicism’s impulse to discover in any culture
a totalizing Weltanschauung (Jay, 1984a, p. 74).
Thus the New Historicism, for example, treats
a literary Text not as an embodiment of the

historicism, New

334
expense of the “reality of the past” (Elton, 1991,
p. 11; cf. Himmelfarb, 1989). However, perhaps
poststructuralist notions – especially versions of
Derrida’s claim that there is nothing, not even
a “real” past, outside the text – pose a new
crisis internal to historicism because they seem to
undermine its defining emphasis on the difference
between present and past. For most historicists,
however, the acknowledgement of the textuality
of the past and the historian’s embeddedness
does not lead to an erasure of the past (see,
however, Hayden White) but rather to the historicizing of the present.

`historicity 
A fundamental feature of human
existence, according to Heidegger. One should,
however, distinguish between “history,” “historicality,” and “historicity.” Historicality is the
property of being in history. Historicity is the
condition of the possibility of history. One can
distinguish between three levels of historicity
(see Husserl, Derrida): historicity of human
existence, historicity of a culture; and historicity
of scientific thinking and, in the long run, philosophy. A mere fact (Tatsche) or an event does not
have historicity. Only an ideal meaning, as Derrida
insists in his work on Husserl, can have it.

Hjelmslev, Louis (1899–1965) Danish linguist. Hjelmslev is best known for his systematic

elaboration of the work of Ferdinand de Saussure
and for developing a glossematic theory of language in Prolegomena to a Theory of Language
(1943), which is his best-known work. Like
Saussure, he aspired not only to develop linguistics into an exact science but also to establish it
as the paradigmatic human science. Hjelmslev’s
theory of glossematics rests on distinctions
between form and substance, expression and
content. Although his analysis of the forms of language employs mathematical models, Hjelmslev
was also determined not to neglect the human
subject who uses language, which led him to an
interest in psychology and Psychoanalysis.
Although they are not uncritical of his work,
both Jacques Derrida and Julia Kristeva have
been markedly influenced by Hjelmslev.

`Hoggart, Richard (1918–) 
English writer
on cultural and social change, literature, media,
and education. He taught in the armed services
and adult education, publishing a study of W.H.
Auden (1951) and then The Uses of Literacy
(1957). Vividly written and unorthodox in construction, this was at once influential, reaching
a broad public through successive paperback
editions. The book drew partly upon personal
experiences in studying changes within the
working-class culture of the north of England,
discussing everyday life, media, and Popular
culture, and also the trajectory through education of “scholarship boys.” Closely observed
details, warning against nostalgia, were set against
the influence, skeptically observed in the shadow
of F.R. Leavis, of American cultural trends.
Running over existing disciplinary boundaries
while celebrating the strengths of working-class
life, the book attracted criticism but also enormous
attention. Its author soon became a regular commentator on cultural issues, for instance, as a
defense witness in the D.H. Lawrence censorship
trial (1960) and as a key member of a committee

in writing, teaching, and everyday life. Her
scholarship targets a diverse array of alternative
and mainstream cultural practices – from representations of Race and Gender in popular
media and black women’s autobiography to
institutionalized oppression on the street and in
the academy.

`Horkheimer, Max (1895–1973) 
German philosopher. From 1930 he was Director of the
Institute of Social Research in Frankfurt, home
of the Frankfurt school. Horkheimer was
initially a strong advocate of a philosophically
reflective empirical social science, aiming at the
comprehension of the social process as a whole
through the development of a new interdisciplinarity. (He originally studied psychology before
turning to philosophy as his specialism.) Such
knowledge was to be instrumental to political
action – in particular, the establishment of a
planned economy. However, as his thought progressed during the period of fascism in Germany,
Horkheimer’s conception of this project became
increasingly philosophical and anti-scientistic.
By the late 1940s, during his exile in the
United States, he had come to see philosophy
as the last bulwark of critical thought against
the degeneration of science into a narrowly
technological Positivism (Horkheimer, 1947).
Such technological rationality was viewed as the
essence of an authoritarian state form common
to advanced capitalist and communist societies
alike. To begin with, this account was accompanied by the utopian prospect of a new,

Horkheimer, Max

on the quality of British broadcasting (Pilkington
Report, 1962). At Birmingham University he
founded the Centre for contemporary
cultural studies, as whose first director he
inaugurated with Stuart Hall its extensive and
pioneering activities, before moving to work in
a senior position for UNESCO, with the Arts
Council of Great Britain, and as Warden of
Goldsmiths’ College, London. He has published
prolifically on a wide range of issues and his
responses to different social and cultural worlds,
distinctive voice, and moral concern are well articulated in the several books of his autobiography.

nonrepressive relationship to nature which
would provide the basis of social freedom. In
his later years, Horkheimer tended towards a
Schopenhauerian pessimism (and a rapprochement
with religion) which distanced him intellectually
from other members of the Frankfurt school
(Horkheimer, 1962).
Horkheimer is best known for his essay
“Traditional and critical theory” (1937), which is
widely held to define the Frankfurt school’s project of an open, critical Marxism insulated from
the historical contingencies of political practice.
The essay generalizes Marx’s critique of political
economy on the basis of a broadly Hegelian
conception of reason to produce an essentially
philosophical model of critical thought. Such
thought, it is claimed, places itself in opposition to reality and in solidarity with the struggle
for freedom by viewing all social practices from
the standpoint of “reason and will.” The wider
historical conditions underlying the perceived
break between theory and politics are outlined
in Horkheimer’s important joint work with
Adorno, Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944).
The continuity of Horkheimer’s writings lies
less in their relationship to Marxism than in the
critique of a narrowly instrumental reason for
which truth is defined by the dictates of selfpreservation – a theme first treated in the early work
on Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Vico (1930). It is this
idea, reread through Nietzsche, that forms the
core of Adorno’s and Horkheimer’s account of
a dialectic of Enlightenment, whereby freedom from nature is won only at the cost of the
repression of “inner nature” in the formation
of rational subjectivity.
Apart from his work on the philosophical
foundations of Critical theory, Horkheimer
produced numerous essay on politics and culture. He also coordinated and contributed to the
Institute’s ambitious collective projects such as
Studies on Authority and the Family (Institute
for Social Research, 1936). His early work was
the inspiration behind Habermas’s attempt to
reformulate the project of critical theory in the
1960s, in order to escape the impasse of Adorno’s
negativism.

`humanism 
Generically, humanism refers to
any System which accords paramountcy to
human interests and possibilities. Paramountcy
has gradually become exclusivity and humanism
now colloquially denotes rejection of the belief
in an omnipotent and omniscient God. In
postwar intellectual controversies, however, it
is distinguished not from theism, but from “theoretical anti-humanism.” It is indicative of the
latter’s influence upon Critical and Cultural
theory that humanism currently invariably has
connotations of Essentialism – anthropocentrism, ethnocentrism, etc. – in sharp contrast to
its formerly positive – secular and humanitarian
– resonance (humanity as the “measure of all
things”).
Debates over humanism frequently conflate
issues which, although related, require to be
distinguished:
(i)

whether there is such a thing as a common
human nature;
(ii) if so, whether it consists of the capacities
of “rationality,” “consciousness,” “moral
agency” traditionally attributed to the
constitutive human subject;
(iii) whether human nature is a basic explanatory concept of social theory, and, more
broadly, whether human agency possesses
explanatory primacy in accounting for
sociohistorical phenomena;
(iv) if so – if the human individual has a role
in “making history” – whether history is an
anthropological process with a purpose;
(v) whether humanism grounds humanitarianism, providing foundations for a normative
critique, as well as an explanation of social
conditions.
Contrary to what is often implied, answers to these
questions are not mutually exclusive. It is, for
example, possible to affirm (i), while denying
(ii), (iii), (iv), and (v); similarly, (i), (ii), (iii), and
(v) may be affirmed, while (iv) is denied. More

337
universalizing historically and culturally specific
(Western) assumptions. It was therefore an Ideology or philosophical anthropology. A scientific
anthropology would, by definition, be a “structural” one – anti-empiricist, anti-historicist, and
anti-humanist. “The ultimate goal of the human
sciences,” Lévi-Strauss announced, “is not to
constitute man but to dissolve him” (1962c, p. 247)
– a declaration that would be adopted and
radicalized at the close of Foucault’s Order of
Things (1966).
The late 1950s and early 1960s had witnessed
a renaissance of humanist Marxism – not only
Sartre, but also Lukács, Goldmann, and Lefebvre
– which appealed to the Feuerbachian writings of
the young Marx (1975), with his ethical philosophy of history as the (dis)alienation of man, the
“supreme being.” “Socialist humanism” aspired
to offer a “third way” between consumer capitalism, whose ideology of liberal humanism
mystified the oppressive realities of Alienation
and Reification, and Stalinism, at whose hands
Marxism had been converted into a repressive
raison d’état. But Structuralism received
Marxist reinforcement from Althusser’s convergent reconstruction of historical Materialism.
Motivated by the conviction that humanism
could not supply the basis for a theoretical or
practical “de-Stalinization,” Althusser pointed to
the increasing adoption of socialist humanism as
the official ideology of Communism.
For Althusser, as his collaborator Macherey
put it (1966, pp. 66–7), with mocking reference to Feuerbach’s humanism, “anthropology is
merely an impoverished and inverted theology.”
The “myth of man” was therefore to be expelled
from Marxism, and the putative science of history rescued from guilt by association with it,
by conceiving history as a “process without a
Subject or telos” (for example, Althusser, 1976,
pp. 94–9). History was neither the unfolding of
an immanent purpose, nor the product of creative
human agency: contra Marx, “men” were not “both
the authors and the actors of their own drama.”
Human beings were subjects in history, rather than
the subjects of it. Provoking E.P. Thompson’s
socialist-humanist counterblast (1978), Althusser
maintained that the predicates attached to the subject by humanism – consciousness, experience,
agency, beliefs, values – were constituted in and
by society (more especially, ideology).

humanism

generally, theoretical anti-humanism is perfectly
consistent with practical humanism.
Crudely periodized and categorized, the modern
humanist controversy began in France as a difference between Heideggerian Phenomenology
and Sartrean Existentialism, gradually escalated
into a European contest between Structuralism and phenomenology and humanist Marxism,
and has persisted as an item in the global contention between Poststructuralism, in its
Nietzschean/Heideggerian inflections, and its
diverse opponents, conservative, Liberal, and
Marxist.
In his “Letter on humanism” (1947) Heidegger
objected to Sartre’s identification of the Cartesian
cogito as the starting point of existentialism and
the basis for a humanism (cf. Sartre, 1946).
Renouncing any conception of “man” as imago
Dei, Heidegger argued that “every humanism is
either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself
made to be the ground of one” (1947, p. 225).
Humanism did not do justice to man’s humanity: “Man is not the lord of beings. Man is the
shepherd of Being” (p. 245).
In the 1950s Heideggerian pastoralism seemed
more appropriate to someone rusticated to the
Black Forest than those domiciled in the Latin
Quarter. But Heidegger’s assimilation of humanism to metaphysics anticipated the philosophical
repertoire of subsequent years. From the outset
this possessed a directly political charge. De Beauvoir (1949) pioneered feminist scrutiny of the
credentials of humanism, inadvertently revealing
the “masculinism” of her companion’s existentialism. Above all, opposition to France’s colonial
war in Algeria (1954–62) led intellectuals to
denounce the hypocrisies of “classic humanism”
(Barthes, 1957, p. 101); for Sartre it stood
exposed as “racist” (1961, p. 22). Such criticisms
tended, however, to counterpose a “genuine”
humanism to the inadequacies or iniquities of
the received doctrine.
Theoretical anti-humanism proper was the
banner of professed or presumed structuralists: Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, Foucault, and
Althusser. Lévi-Strauss’s The Savage Mind
(1962), with its assault upon Sartre’s Critique of
Dialectical Reason (1960), sounded the leitmotifs.
Humanism consisted of a subject-centered epistemology, inevitably replicating the Cartesian
circle, and a subject-constituted history, spuriously

Husserl, Edmund

338
After 1968 structuralist “objectivism” was
superseded by poststructuralism, in its deconstructionist and genealogical forms, with Derrida
joining Foucault in Nietzschean opposition to
humanism. According to the latter’s genealogy
of modern morals (1975), “power-knowledge”
(for example, penology) operated via a subjectification of persons. There were no grounds,
however, for theoretical critique of such Discourses as ideologies, or for normative critique
of them as repressive. For science and ethics were
equally implicated in the regimes and politics
of truth. No metadiscourse eluded the ubiquitous
will to power/knowledge. Under the umbrella of
Postmodernism, and the slogan of difference,
these and cognate themes are common currency
today, albeit that they are challenged by representatives of the Frankfurt school (for example,
Habermas, 1985). Without any pretense to settle some intractable disputes, a few concluding
reflections may be offered.
First, under the spur of the environmental
crisis, there has recently been a revival of philosophical and ethical naturalism, introducing a
“nonanthropocentric” concept of human nature
whereby Homo sapiens is placed on a continuum
with other animal species. Second, while the critique of humanist “moralism” – any discourse that
abstracts from the factual states that culturally
condition moral values – is cogent, it does not
entail ethical relativism. Third, any anti-humanism
that subscribes to epistemological perspectivism
subverts its intention to provide a more adequate
account of social relations than humanism;
similarly, if it adheres to ethical relativism, it
encounters insurmountable problems in sustaining the normative claims it advances against the
oppressive homogenizations of humanism. Fourth,
while the notion that history is the enactment of
a collective human purpose has been discredited,
denial of a constitutive role in history to human
beings is a fallacious deduction from a correct
premise. Fifth, the human agency/social structure
dichotomy appears misconceived, both because
there is no plausible trans-historical answer to the
question it poses, and because it is difficult to
envisage its terms as anything other than interdependent in the reproduction and transformation
of societies. In this and other respects, the polemical themes of “humanism” and “anti-humanism”
are arguably part of the problem, not part of the
solution.

philosopher, founder of Phenomenology, and
major influence on such thinkers as Gadamer,
Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Ricoeur, and
Sartre. Husserl was a prolific writer, whose
work is being collected in a series of volumes under
the general title Husserliana. His most important publications are Ideas: General Introduction to

Investigations in Genealogy of Logic, The Paris

His “Origin of Geometry” (“Die Frage nach dem
Ursprung der Geometrie”) has been reissued with
an important commentary by Jacques Derrida.
Especially in Ideas and Formal and Transcendental Logic, Husserl developed a theory of the
structures of consciousness and an account of how
the mind works, based on a series of overlapping
distinctions, including sensuous “hyletic data” in
contrast to intentional “noeses.” Hyletic data are
sensory materials passively received by the mind
and are without meaning or conceptual articulation. They are thus literally the given (the datum)
of experience. Noetic elements, in contrast,
are those that, by virtue of their intentionality,
bestow sense on the otherwise inert hyletic
data. The noetic relies on the assumption of the
stable, transcendental ego. Thus Husserlian phenomenology assumes a naïve ego psychology as

simultaneously with Freud (Ideas was first published in 1913). Although Julia Kristeva relies
heavily on Husserl’s theory of language, nonetheless she is severely critical of his concept of
the transcendental ego (Kristeva, 1974, p. 166.)
Husserl’s project was to advance a science of
beginnings, or a first philosophy. In order to
provide philosophy with such a scientific beginning, he attempted to remain aloof from all
theories or anticipatory ideas. To this end he
asserted his “General Thesis of the Natural
Standpoint,” which holds that there is a “factworld” existing “out there,” that it always exists,
and that it may at certain points appear “other”
than it was supposed (Husserl, 1913, p. 97.)

I

`ideological state apparatus 
A category
introduced by Althusser, whose distinction
between the repressive state apparatus (RSA) and
ideological state apparatuses (ISAs) is related to
Gramsci’s differentiation between coercion and
consent. Whereas the RSA operates by force,
the ISAs – the family, schools, the mass media,
etc. – function to reproduce existing relations
of production by subjecting social classes to the
dominant Ideology.

`ideology 
According to a recent survey
(McLellan, 1986, p. 1), ideology is “the most
elusive concept in the whole of social science” and
“an essentially contested concept.” Its elusiveness
is aggravated by the fact that the term scarcely
figures in the work of thinkers who have
influenced twentieth-century constructions of
the concept (for example, Durkheim, Freud,
Saussure); while oeuvres in which it looms large
(including that of its eighteenth-century progenitor, Antoine Destutt de Tracy) have little
or no resonance today.
The terms of contestation include the epistemological status, the sociological salience and function,

the political inflection and implications, and the
subjective/psychological or objective/social character
of ideology. This has permitted a bewildering
variety of conceptual permutations within both
Marxism – the tradition with which the term
is principally associated – and rival doctrines
(for example, the Sociology of knowledge or
Liberalism).
Drastically oversimplifying, conceptions of
ideology, whether Marxist or non-Marxist, can
be specified according to four broad and nonexclusive parameters:
(i)

the epistemologically negative – ideology
as a type of distorted, false thought (for
example, the “consciousness” of human
subjects in capitalist society);
(ii) the socially relative – ideology as any set of
opinions, beliefs, attitudes (for example, the
“world view” of a social group or class);
(iii) the restricted – “theoretical ideology” (a
more or less conscious system of ideas);
(iv) the expanded – “practical ideology” (the
more or less unconscious medium of
habitual behavior).
(i) is characteristic of the main accounts offered
by Marx and Engels; (ii), while present in Marx’s
1859 Preface, may be regarded as substantially
an innovation after Marx, featuring in Lukács’s
Hegelian Marxism and in Mannheim’s critique
of the parti pris of historical Materialism.

341
conjuncture. Deployed in a negative and critical
sense, ideology was understood as the distorted
thought which derived from, and in turn served
to mask, the social contradictions inherent in
Class society, thereby directly or indirectly
legitimating a structure of domination. As with
any instance of the phenomenon, the particularity of abstract “German ideology” was explicable by the peculiarities of concrete German
reality. Moreover, it could be vanquished only
by a revolutionary political practice that would
transform the social conditions which had
engendered it.
Often incorrectly classified as a theory of “false
consciousness,” in which ideology is merely an
epiphenomenal illusion to be dispelled by positive science, Marx and Engels’s account of the
ideological mechanism is vulnerable to criticism
on the grounds of the sensationalism of its
central camera obscura metaphor, which implies
that the human mind spontaneously misrepresents
the external objects presented to sense experience.
Analogous problems beset the analysis of
capitalist ideology in Capital (1867, vol. 1, ch. 1),
which revolves around the notion of commodity fetishism (and the alienation it constitutes).
Here “social being” tout court is not inverted in
“social consciousness,” because social being itself
is divided. Ideological inversions reflect actual
inversions in a stratified reality. Ideology is not
the failure to perceive reality, for reality is ideological, comprising a realm of objective appearances – the “phenomenal forms” of the sphere
of commodity circulation – which conceal by
inversion the “essential relations” of the capitalist mode of production, in the interests of the
dominant, exploiting class. Ideology transcribes
liberal-capitalist appearances – that “very Eden
of the innate rights of man [wherein] alone rule
Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham.” Science, by contrast, is counterphenomenal, explaining how the “enchanted world” of capitalism
comprises surface phenomena which travesty its
underlying modality. It is therefore indispensable to the exposure of the dehistoricizing effects
of “Naturalization” and “universalization,”
typical of bourgeois ideology – a necessary, but
insufficient, condition of “changing the world.”
If in The German Ideology the source of ideology is idealism, in Capital it is the capitalist
economy. The misperception/misrepresentation

ideology

(iii) encompasses (i) and (ii), and predominated
in philosophico-political controversies up to the
1960s; whereas (iv), initiated by Marx, developed
by Gramsci, and elaborated by Althusser,
supplied the received definition – and site of
critical debate – in much Cultural theory
thereafter. Indeed, it may be said that the
“problematization” of Althusserian and related
endeavors to retrieve the concept of ideology
from the perceived discredit into which it had
fallen by association with (i) and (ii) has induced
a pervasive contemporary disaffection with it.
Positive and pejorative connotations have
accompanied “ideology” since it was coined in
1797 by de Tracy to denote the “science of
ideas,” bearing upon both substantives in that
formula. De Tracy conceived his project as an
intellectual “mechanics” which would complement the social “physics” hankered after by the
Enlightenment. Armed with Empiricism, a
“Newton of the science of thought” could identify – and correct – the erroneous reasoning
which impeded progress (above all, the “prejudices” instilled by “tyrants and priests”). For
the idéologues, as for the philosophes generally,
the requisite antidote to religious and other
obscurantisms was secular education, dispensed
by the suitably enlightened. Napoleon’s subsequent
denigration of “ideologists” as “nebulous metaphysicians,” whose rationalist schemas neglected
“knowledge of the human heart and of the lessons
of history,” pioneered a derogatory theme which
became a topos of Cold War anti-Marxism.
Paradoxically, however, not dissimilar accents
echoed in Marx’s original treatment of the subject in the mid-1840s.
In The German Ideology (1932, part 1), Marx
and Engels interrogated Feuerbach’s critique of
religion as the Paradigm of human Alienation,
criticizing it as an ideological critique of ideology.
The left-Hegelians had imparted an illusory
autonomy to ideas, rooting both the subject/
predicate “inversions” of theology (God/Man)
and their correction (Man/God) in thought. In
place of such “idealism,” Marx and Engels urged
a “historical materialism,” according to which
“social being” determined “social consciousness.”
The matrix of ideological “mystification” was
the “material base” of society – the “actual lifeprocess” of “real individuals” which governed
the (re)production of ideas in any historical

ideology

342
of reality is inscribed in reality, which generates
a false knowledge of itself. Social agents passively
assimilate and articulate the deceptive “phenomenal forms” perceptible from their structural
location as “supports” of capitalist relations of
production.
The economic Essentialism of this determinate nexus between social position, cognitive
deficiency, and class interest was, if anything,
accentuated in Lukács’s subsequent reaction
against the “mechanical materialism” of the
orthodox Marxism of the Second International.
Taking its cue from a letter of Engels to
Mehring, and moulding historical materialism to the Procrustean bed of the Base and
superstructure topography, it had diffused
the notion of “false consciousness.” Lenin, basing himself upon the 1859 Preface, had already
advanced an alternative – neutral or even positive
– conception of ideology (for example, “scientific socialism” as proletarian ideology), but it was
Lukács who offered the most systematic account
of it. In History and Class Consciousness (1923),
he fused the category of commodity fetishism
with the Weberian analysis of “rationalization” in
a theory of Reification. On this construction
bourgeois ideology was indeed “false consciousness,” but not so much because it was ideology
as because it was bourgeois. The social genesis
of ideas determined their cognitive status. The
(in)validity of an ideology was dependent upon
the historical “class situation” of the collective
subject whose expression it was. Thus, whereas the
antinomies of bourgeois ideology transposed
reified capitalist actuality, it was the unique
privilege of the proletariat, as the “identical
subject–object of history,” to possess in Marxism
the “proletarian science” of the (mis)adventures
of the occluded social totality.
Notoriously, however, this represented the
“imputed” (true) class consciousness of the proletariat – as opposed to its “psychological” (false)
consciousness which, until and unless rectified,
remained in thrall to the reifying logic of capitalism. Accordingly, over and above its dubious
valorization of the “reform of consciousness” in
the revolutionary process, Lukácsian Historicism
is condemned to a vicious, self-subversive, epistemological circle. In making the truth relative
to the ascribed consciousness of the historically
most progressive class, it presumes what it must

demonstrate: the cognitive superiority of the
proletarian standpoint.
Lukács’s deduction of the falsity of bourgeois
ideology from its capitalist origins prompted
Mannheim’s historicist critique of the truth claims
of Marxism. Sponsoring an objection which
enjoyed a prosperous (if rarely attributed) posterity, in Ideology and Utopia (1929) he contended
that Marxism postulated the social determination
– and hence cultural limitation – of all ideas,
yet exempted itself from the historical critique this
logically entailed, and to which it subjected all
other Weltanschauungen, claiming a monopoly on
knowledge when it was merely one partial viewpoint among a myriad others. As with contemporary perspectivism, this posed the dilemma
of epistemological relativism for Mannheim – a
conclusion he sought (unsuccessfully) to avoid via
his “relationism.”
Lukács had inaugurated the Western Marxist preoccupation with ideology as a central mechanism
in the maintenance of capitalism, in defiance of
socialist expectations after the 1914–18 war and
the Bolshevik Revolution (Anderson, 1976). And
his legacy was to be resumed, not only in the
Genetic structuralism of Goldmann, but
also – in pessimistic form – by the Frankfurt
school – whether in Adorno’s critique of ideology as “identity thinking,” which suppresses
“difference,” or in Marcuse’s diagnosis of the
psychonormality (that is, psychopathology) of
everyday life in advanced industrial societies
(One-Dimensional Man, 1964). Lukács had made
the equation between natural science and bourgeois ideology. For Marcuse science was “instrumental reason” which had been absorbed into the
routine reality of consumer capitalism, constituting a vehicle of human alienation that could
be undone neither by an impotent “Critical
theory” nor by the traditional – now incorporated – working class. If “high” art alone held out
une promesse de bonheur against the omnipotent,
quasi-totalitarian logic of capital (including
commodified mass culture), residual rebellious
impulses were confined to the marginalized and
excluded subjects of the First World.
An analogous scenario, albeit with antithetical
political implications, was projected contemporaneously by transatlantic, liberal-democratic
heralds of “the end of ideology” in welfare
capitalism (see Bell, 1960 (1979)). Ideology was

343
the world” capable of cementing a counterhegemonic social bloc.
Gramsci’s historicist affinities with Lukács are
the most problematic aspect of his immensely
influential propositions. Adapting elements of
Gramscian Marxism, Althusserianism aimed to
surmount this problem by dispensing with its
Historicism and pragmatism, and insisting upon
the cognitive autonomy of historical materialism.
Althusser’s theory of ideology, which might
be categorized as a negative but nonpejorative
conception of it as essentially “practico-social,”
arguably owed more to the Durkheimian notion
of “collective representations” and the Freudian
account of civilized “illusions” than to Marx. It
dissented from its rivals on three main grounds:
(i)

Rejecting economic determinism, Althusser
allotted ideology Relative autonomy as
an objective domain of social reality;
(ii) affirming its “materiality,” he expanded its
definition from ideas to “lived relations,”
and from conscious to unconscious
dimensions of social experience; and
(iii) repudiating Humanism, he depicted it
as the mechanism of the formation of
human subjects endowed with the necessary illusion of autonomy (such that they
considered themselves the unacknowledged legislators of their own world).
For Althusser, ideology was distinct from – but
not the antithesis of – science, since it comprised
a quite different, “incommensurable . . . register
of being” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 139): the ideoaffective, “imaginary” realm of “lived experience.”
In his seminal essay of 1970, “Ideology and ideological state apparatuses,” Althusser sought to
integrate a general theory, influenced by Lacan’s
rereading of Freud, of the ideological Interpellation of the individual as a subject, with a
specific political theory, indebted to Gramsci, of
the functioning of Ideological state apparatuses in the reproduction of capitalist relations
of production. In the process, he conjoined sociological and epistemological premises for his
controversial deduction, contrary to Marx, that
there would be no “end of ideology” under Communism. Ideology would persist, both because of
the ineliminable opacity of the deep structures of
any conceivable Social formation and because

ideology

conceived as the opposite of empirical science
– a specific kind of system of thought at once
suffused with fanatical irrationalism and purblind rationalism. And Marxism was an exemplary
instance of it: a “totalizing” theory whose practical correlate was “totalitarian” politics.
The liberal empiricism of this position was
doubtless facilitated by the fact that it has been
the United States’ “fate as a nation not to have
ideologies but to be one” (Richard Hofstadter,
quoted in McLellan, 1986, p. 82). Its obituary
of ideology proved premature, however. In a
political conjuncture marked by the global crisis
of the postwar settlement, historical materialism
and, with it, the concept of ideology experienced
a remarkable renaissance.
Two Marxist initiatives were of especial
significance here. The first – Gramsci’s brilliant
reflections on the political and cultural specificity of the West in his Prison Notebooks
(1929–35) – introduced the effective distinction between theoretical and practical ideology
into Marxism. Recasting Machiavelli’s contrast
between “force” and “fraud” as distinct, though
combined, modes of class domination – viz.,
coercion and consent – Gramsci, like Lukács,
advanced a positive conception of ideology.
“Organic ideologies,” the world views of fundamental social classes, were indissolubly theoretical and practical, running the gamut of cultural
phenomena from abstract philosophy to
“common sense.” According to a widespread
interpretation of Gramsci, class domination
in Western societies was not solely – or even
predominantly – attributable to the repressive
deployment (or deterrent threat) of force in
“political society,” but the achievement and
exercise of Hegemony (including, crucially,
ideological direction) in Civil society. The
proletariat possessed a dual consciousness – that,
beholden to the capitalist class, imposed in the
institutions of civil society, and that derived
from its daily experience of the world. The “progressive” aspects of the latter required fostering
by the “collective intellectual” of the Communist
Party, if the revolutionary potential it harbored
for a new hegemony was to be realized. As
promoted by organic intellectuals of the proletariat, the “philosophy of praxis” – Gramsci’s
designation for Marxism – was the unity of theory and practice, a revolutionary “conception of

ideology

344
human beings were not the rational animals
of pre-Freudian liberal humanism. (The subject
was not the substratum of conscious agency, but
the illusory ego of the psychic apparatus.)
Althusser’s ingenious proposals were met with
three principal reservations, concerning their
supposed economic Functionalism, political
pessimism, and epistemological dogmatism. But
before attending to these, we should register the
remarkable range of work produced under the separate or joint auspices of Gramsci and Althusser
from the 1960s onwards. Coinciding with cognate
structuralist and semiotic analyses of myth as
the “imaginary resolution of real contradictions”
(Lévi-Strauss) or the “naturalization” of history
(Barthes), a “triple alliance” was established in
France between Althusserian Marxism, Lacanian
psychoanalysis, and Saussurean linguistics. In
the work of Pêcheux, for example, it led to a
resumption of “discourse analysis”, pioneered by
V.N. Voloshinov (Marxism and the Philosophy
of Language, 1929), which examined ideology as
a matter of Discourse, or the inscriptions of
social power in language. In figures associated with
Tel Quel, it spawned a notion of ideology as the
arbitrary, but motivated, “closure” of the infinite
productivity of language, inclining Kristeva
and others to a preference for the polysemic
texts of high modernism over those of classical realism. In Britain the Tel Quel option was pursued
by the editors of Screen (for example, Heath
and Mulvey); while a version of AlthusseroLacanianism was appropriated by Mitchell for
the feminist explanation of “woman’s estate” in
patriarchal capitalism. However, the Gramscian
stimulus was equally pronounced – whether in the
reinterpretation of British Culture and society
advanced by Anderson and his colleagues in
the New Left Review; or in the investigations of
Hall and Co. at the Centre for contemporary
cultural studies, which abandoned the traditional aestheticist disdain for Popular Culture
and broadened the social optic of Marxism to
encompass nonclass identities.
Such was the proliferation of ideology critique,
and such was the explicit or implicit significance accorded it, that a predictable reaction set
in. Abercrombie et al. (1980) challenged the
putative “dominant ideology thesis” featuring
in much marxisant discussion of the topic, on
theoretical and empirical grounds (above all, for

underestimation of what Marx dubbed the “dull
compulsion of economic relations”). This did
not, however, serve to inhibit the prevalent
“culturalism” or “ideologism” (for example, in the
analyses of “Thatcherism” advocated by Marxism
Today in the 1980s). Of greater moment in the
discrediting of the concept as an analytical tool,
however, was a series of converging critiques
of historical materialism from varieties of Poststructuralism. In hybrid forms they constitute
the consensual position in mainstream contemporary theory.
Seeded by the Genealogy of Nietzsche,
Foucault’s replacement of the ideology/science
dichotomy with the power–knowledge couplet
has proved particularly attractive to critics of the
alleged “scientism” and “reductionism” of the
Marxist tradition. As popularized, Foucauldian and
similar counterconstructions partially replicated
the objection in Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge to the self-assigned “privileged” status of
Marxism; they might be encapsulated in Carlyle’s
inimitable (ideological) maxim: “Orthodoxy is
my doxy, heterodoxy is thy doxy.” Yet they are
far more radical, comprising: (i) epistemological
anti-realism (rejection of the category of “representation” as intrinsically empiricist); (ii) a consequent cognitive perspectivism and evaluative
relativism or pragmatism; and (iii) a suspicion
of reason as, if not a Humean slave of the passions, then a Nietzschean accomplice of power
(Eagleton, 1991, pp. xi–xii).
Perhaps the most salient anglophone versions
of the case have issued from the self-consuming
enterprises of “post-Althusserianism” (for example,
Hirst, 1979) and “post-Marxism” (Laclau and
Mouffe, 1985). The Althusserian postulate of
the ubiquity of ideology, rendering it coterminous
with culture, posed the problem of how it could
be known, let alone transformed. The canonical
answer – science – inspired skepticism on the
grounds that it conferred an unwarrantable
“privilege” upon Marxist metadiscourse. According to Hirst and his fellow thinkers, for example,
the project of epistemology was inherently
“rationalist” and correspondingly “dogmatic.”
Its Althusserian-Marxist variant was no exception,
remaining ensnared in a pre-Saussurean account
of signification (the mistaken belief that the
signified preexisted the signifier, conflated with
the different claim that the linguistic Sign

`imaginary, symbolic, real 
The three orders
– imaginary, symbolic, and real – are central
to the thought of Jacques Lacan, the French
psychoanalyst who is famed for his re-reading
of Freud. Drawing upon philosophy, linguistics,
structural anthropology, topology, and game
theory, Lacan’s work emerged in the 1950s and
1960s when interest in the idea of the subject and
its insertion into society was at its height. His three
orders – concerned with identification, specularity, narcissism, and aggression in the imaginary;
the unconscious, signification, language, and the
law in the symbolic; and that which exceeds
symbolization absolutely in the real – have, in turn,
produced a rich array of criticism. From history
to philosophy, art theory to anthropology, literary and film theory, political theory, media studies
and communication, Lacan’s three orders have
proved an abundant source for contemporary
thinking.
The imaginary marks the child’s movement
from its neo-natal stage to its identification with
an image. “The mirror stage and its formative
function of the I” in Lacan’s Ecrits is the best
known account of this development. As yet
unable to “walk or even stand up,” as Lacan puts
it, the intently looking infant is fascinated by
her or his image in the mirror, which appears to
possess the bodily mastery and unity he or she
lacks. Focusing on the image and “overcoming
in a flutter of jubilant activity” who or what supports him or her, the child “assumes” the image,

imaginary, symbolic, real

possesses an extralinguistic referent). Recycling this
imposture, Marxism pretended to supply a true
account of real causal relations. It did not. Conforming to the condition of any social theory,
it did not represent (that is, reflect) some
extradiscursive reality, but constituted its objects
in discourse, discursively constructing a social
totality governed by economic determination.
This was a theoretical demerit with deleterious
political consequences (“essentialism,” “classism,”
“workerism,” etc.). And if the possibility of social
science was unfounded, then its traditional
“other” – ideology – should be abandoned as an
irredeemably epistemological category.
There are good reasons to believe that such
critiques of epistemological dogmatism exhibit
a dogmatism all of their own. On the one hand,
historical materialism neither declines to justify
its knowledge claims nor does it purport, in
Cartesian or Hegelian fashion, to afford certain
and absolute knowledge of social phenomena.
By contrast, conventionalism, and the pragmatism
with which it is often conjugated, appears to assert
a knowledge of the modalities of discourse, and
to immunize its own constructions by invoking
the impossibility of any objective validation.
Kindred considerations underlie Habermas’s
enduring commitment to “emancipatory critique”
as a form of legitimately “interested” rationality;
or Eagleton’s reanimation of a critical notion of
ideology as “false or deceptive beliefs . . . arising
not from the interests of a dominant social class
but from the material structure of society as a
whole” (1991, p. 30).
This conception returns us to a negative definition of ideology, while preserving something of
the expanded understanding of it. Above all,
without repudiating theoretical explanation, it
emphasizes the indispensability of the political
transformation of the social structures that
engender ideological misrepresentations. And
it regards the current reedition of the “end of
ideology,” in which avant-garde theory coalesces
with the liberal pluralism of Rorty’s “North
Atlantic postmodern bourgeois liberal democracy,” as the narcissistic self-image of a quintessentially ideological age.

identifying narcissistically with what is seen.
However arresting the example of the mirror
may be, a looking-glass is not an essential element
in the development of imaginary identification;
the infant is equally capable of identifying with
the bodies of other people, and particularly those
of other children. However, what the mirror
illustrates with remarkable precision is the nature
of the infant’s Imaginary identification with her
or his body-image. The child has mistaken an
image, whether derived from the mirror or other
people, for its self, and, moreover, has endowed
the image with qualities that are the creation
of the child making the identification, qualities
that do not belong to the image per se, or to the
looking child (Ecrits, pp. 1–3). This misrecognition or méconnaissance ensures not only that
the ego, the I, is formed in delusion from the outset, but also that the structure of the self is one
of alienation, capture, and fixation. Through the
child’s méconnaissance life-long division springs,
as the fixity imagined for the ego comes into
conflict with the constant coming-into-being of
subjectivity.
The imaginary is, as this sketch suggests, profoundly related to the body’s image, to dualism
and resemblance. Imaginary identifications are,
however, broken into by the symbolic. The child
who gazes into the mirror has already come
within the reach of the symbolic through bearing
a name. Naming marks the child out, bringing her
or him into the structure of the signifying system
that precedes birth: “That a name, however confused it may be, designates a specific person, is
exactly what makes up the transition to human
state. If one has to define the moment at which
a man becomes human, we can say that it is in
the moment when, however little it be, he enters
into the symbolic relation” (Seminar I, p. 155).
The infant’s naming confers identity on the
subject, and brings her or him within the realm
of the fundamental signifier, the Name-of-theFather, and of the Law, principles that underlie
social relations. Thus it is within the symbolic order
that the subject appears. The symbolic is also the
realm of the Other, and the unconscious.
While the imaginary and symbolic can be
thought of independently, they are, in fact, interdependent, so much so that Lacan says of the
symbolic that is it impossible to “speculate on what
preceded it other than by symbols” (Seminar II,

p. 5). Further, neither the imaginary nor the
symbolic operates independently of the third
order, the real, which “eludes signification
absolutely” (Seminar I, p. 66). Lacan illustrates the
extent of the interdependence of the three orders
by means of a topological figure, the Borromean
Knot. In the knot three circles, representing the
real, the imaginary, and the symbolic, intersect.
The circles support and interlock; if one of the
circles is cut, the whole collapses. Thus “each
term is sustained only in its topological relation
to the others” (Seminar XI, p. 89). With the
introduction of the Borromean Knot (1972–8) the
three orders become equivalent and the real,
irreducible to meaning, becomes “primordially
nothing but the gap that separates a thing from
itself” (ni1ek, 2007). The gap that is the real
remains, “always returns,” but is never present
within our signifying systems. In the early
twenty-first century the real has, arguably, come
to be the most constructive of Lacan’s orders
for cultural criticism, offering ways of thinking
signifying systems in terms of their necessary
limitations, their aporias and negativities.

`intentional fallacy 
A term central to New
criticism, which derives from the title of an essay
by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley,
“The intentional fallacy” (1946). The essay seeks
to detach the judgment of a literary Text from
an understanding of the author’s intention in
writing it. A poem (the New Critics tend to
privilege Poetry in their works, but the concept
is equally applicable to other genres) “goes about
the world beyond [the author’s] power to intend
about it or control it”; it should be understood
in terms of the “dramatic speaker” of the text,
not the author, and be judged only by whether it
works or not. The notion of the “autonomous,”
self-validating “text itself,” which assumes its
meaning and value solely in the form of its
independent verbal structure, and which alone
is the proper study of Literary criticism, lies
at the heart of New Criticism.
The intentional fallacy has been subjected to
rigorous critical commentary since its first
exposition. Nevertheless, the issues raised by the
concept are still at the centre of debates around
the author/text/reader nexus. Ironically, new
impetus for these has stemmed from the contradictory but significant relations between New
Criticism and Deconstruction. The latter’s
decentering of the author and authority and its
emphasis on textuality seem to imply a kinship
with the intentional fallacy; however, deconstruction’s premise of a text’s continual reproduction in the reading of it runs entirely counter
to the literary Ideology of New Criticism –
which has taken the determinate “text itself ” as
the ultimate arbiter of its own meaning.

`international style 
The name given by HenryRussell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson, in the
catalog of the 1932 architecture exhibition at the
Museum of Modern Art, to a group of buildings (particularly those by Walter Gropius, Le
Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and
J.J.P. Oud), designed between the end of the
1914–18 war and 1931. Generally, the design
of these buildings is described as stressing the
handling of function, but in which Functionalism is subordinated to the aesthetic element in
architecture. Specifically, the basic artistic conventions that shape the style of these buildings
are described as placing emphasis on volume
rather than mass, on regularity rather than symmetry, and on ordering of detail rather than
application of ornament – and, added later
by Hitchcock, emphasis on the articulation of
structure.

`interpellation 
A category introduced by
Althusser (1970, pp. 44–57) to designate the
imaginary mechanism of mutual recognition by
which Ideology operates to constitute concrete
individuals as human subjects. Denying the constitutive role of the human Subject, Althusser
argues that subjects of experience are ideologically
produced and thereby equipped to perform the
roles to which they are allocated in the social
division of labor.
Althusser’s account of subject formation has
been widely criticized for the circularity of its
argument – its presupposition of a subject with
the capacity to recognize, and respond to, its
interpellation – and the fatalism of its politics –
its effective equation of “subjectification” and
“subjection.”

`interpretive communities 
A term pertaining to Stanley Fish’s reader-oriented theory of
literature (see Reader-response criticism).
Interpretive communities consist of a group
of “informed readers” (Fish) who possess both
linguistic competence by having internalized the
syntactic and semantic knowledge required for
reading, and Literary competence by being
familiar with our literary conventions.
By way of introducing the concept of interpretive communities, Fish argues that the
informed reader’s interpretive perceptions and
aesthetic judgments are not idiosyncratic but
socially constructed; they depend heavily on
the assumptions shared by the social group or
groups to which the reader belongs. Interpretive
communities adopt particular kinds of reading
strategies which will, in due course, determine the
entire reading process, the stylistic peculiarities
of a literary Text as well as the experience of
assimilating them.
If Fish’s categories were to be taken seriously,
reader-response criticism would cease to be riddled
with questions concerning either the mode of
existence of the literary work or the Aesthetics
of perception (the active and creative process
a reader engages in when reading a text): both
would collapse into a set of assumptions and
conventions shared among a socially defined
community of readers.

intertextuality A term proposed by Julia
Kristeva, drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin’s notion

of dialogism (“the necessary relation of any utterance to other utterances”) to indicate a Text’s construction from texts: a work is not a self-contained,
individually authored whole, but the absorption
and transformation of other texts, “a mosaic
of quotations” (Kristeva, 1967). This is a matter
not of influence (from one author or work to
another), but of the multifarious and historically
variable relations between works as heterogeneous textual productions (“influence” is simply
one limited and limiting figure of intertextuality).
Kristeva developed this perception in a generic
study of “the text of the novel” as resulting from
the combination or transposition of several
different Sign systems (Kristeva, 1970), while
Roland Barthes analyzed a single Balzac story
as a tissue of “voices,” redeploying and recasting
fragments from a range of discourses on which
it depends for its intelligibility (Barthes, 1970).
Such an approach through intertexuality situates
literary structure within social structure as itself
textual. Nothing is given other than constituted
within Discourse and a text is not the reflection
of some nontextual “exterior” but a practice of
writing that inscribes – and is inscribed in – the
social as just such an intertextual field, a mesh of
textual systems.
In a move characteristic of Poststructuralism, intertextuality displaces intersubjectivity:
the reading of a text is seen not as a subjectto-subject exchange between author-source and
reader-receiver, but as the performance by
author and reader of a multitude of writings
that cross and interact on the site of the text. A
text is thus never finished, written once and
for all; it exists in the continuing time of its
intertextual production, which includes the texts
of its future (those that will be brought to its
reading) – as intertext it has, in Barthes’s words,
“no law but the infinitude of its recurrences.”
Though the condition of all texts, intertextuality
may also be used evaluatively, distinguishing
texts which attempt to cover up their intertextual nature from those which acknowledge
and display it. Where Balzac refers his novels
to the truth – the depiction – of an externally
grounded reality, Joyce, self-described as “a
scissors-and-paste man,” offers Finnegans Wake
as “stolentelling,” an accumulation of bits and
pieces of writing from the world as infinite text.
Modernism in this distinction marks exactly

`Irigaray, Luce (1932–) 
French feminist philosopher, linguist, and psychoanalyst. Irigaray is
perhaps the most influential of the three major
French feminists (see Cixous; Kristeva). Her
first major work, Speculum of the Other Woman
(1974) with its critique of psychoanalysis, led
to her marginalization by the Lacanians and the
Freudian school, but has continued to provoke
debate among feminists.
Irigaray’s work starts from the premise that
established (male) Systems of thought fail to
represent or take account of the feminine and its
desire. This assertion is derived, in part, from
her analysis of Plato’s philosophy in Speculum
(1974), where the impulse to impose order on the
formless non-differentiation of the cave (hystera,
hence matrix or womb) results in the repres-

sion of the cave as origin. The exclusion of what
cannot be accounted for in this imposed order
or “economy of the same,” means that what is
outside remains unidentified, indistinct, and
unarticulated. This model is explained by Irigaray
in terms of the specular. The idea of the speculum in Irigaray’s work draws on its use as a
mirror, and as an instrument used to view
women’s sexual organs; thus the speculum looks
into the other – the feminine – but finds there
only a reflection of itself/the viewer. This system
is used to provide a critique of Freud, where
the specularity of thought serves to erase female
sexuality, as her “sex” (used by Irigaray to refer
to the genitalia) presents no visible sign (that is,
phallus) to view. Freud is seen to contribute to
the “economy of the same” by articulating his
psychoanalytic system around the primacy of the
Phallus, against which the female sex is defined
by lack and the desire for what it cannot possess.
In this system, Irigaray argues, Freud’s emphasis
on the superior activity of the male results in the
designation of woman as a “receptacle” to hold
the male “product” (1977). Freud’s insistence on
the need for the girl child to make the transition
from clitoral to vaginal pleasure marks the male
need for woman to fulfill her role as “a holeenvelope that serves to sheathe and massage the
penis” (1977, p. 23). This results in the erasure of
woman’s pleasure, exiled beyond the parameters
of male discourses and institutions.
In This Sex Which Is Not One (1977), a response
to readers’ questions raised by Speculum (1974),
Irigaray expounds and expands her critique of
Freud and Lacan, and attempts an explanation
of what constitutes the Other, the feminine.
Woman’s pleasure lies not in looking (the
mirroring and replication of the same) but in
touching. This touching, in the first instance, is
located in the woman’s sex, where the lips of her
vagina endlessly touch: “her genitals are formed
of two lips in continuous contact. Within herself,
she is already two – but not divisible into one(s)
– that caress each other” (1977, p. 24). Her sex
then is double, in contradistinction to male
sexuality, located in the singularity of the phallus.
In this way her sex is always plural, in excess of
what is defined for her, and her relationship to
the other is fundamentally different, as the other
lies within herself. Irigaray argues that women thus
have an increased capacity for alterity, and access

Irigaray, Luce

the break from which the problem of intertextuality is posed as such.
Michael Riffaterre, defining intertextuality as
the reader’s perception of the relations between
a text and all the other texts that have preceded
or followed it, is concerned to allow both for
aleatory intertextuality (the reader brings the
text into play with his or her familiar texts) and
obligatory intertextuality (the “hypogram” or
core intertext that is a work’s matrix, presupposed
in its reading) (Riffaterre, 1979). Gérard Genette
proposes five types of transtextuality, his overall
term for the relations a text may hold with
others; with intertextuality limited to the specific
relation of copresence, the effective presence of one
text in another through quotation, plagiarism, or
allusion (Genette, 1982). A particular intertextual
history is provided in Henry Louis Gates’s
account of the Afro-American literary tradition
as characterized by Signifyin(g): texts talking
to and from other texts in a self-reflexive process
of repetition and revision that seeks to make
representational space for “the so called Black
Experience” (Gates, 1988a).

to an economy based upon proximity rather
than upon ownership and property. The female
body is thus the site of an alternative Symbol, for
the touch allows a desire which cannot be contained within the economy of the gaze, where
woman is the passive object.
Language is vital in the perpetuation of these
systems as well as being, for Irigaray, the site of
the potential to subvert them. The inclusion of
the other within woman renders her language
incomprehensible to male Discourse because
her speech is “always not identical to what she
means” (1977, p. 29), at the same time as language
cannot articulate the “feminine.” It is precisely
this position of alterity which Irigaray suggests
will serve to change the existing structures. In the
initial stage, it is mimicry which will serve to
introduce women into the systems of male discourse: “One must assume the feminine role
deliberately. Which means already to convert a
force of subordination into an affirmation, and
thus begin to thwart it” (1977, p. 76). This means
demanding to speak as a (masculine) “subject,”
while making visible by “playful repetition” what
was supposed to remain invisible. The project
is not to assert woman as either subject or
object, but to “[jam] the theoretical machinery
itself,” and to enact a “disruptive excess” in order
to undo the language structures which maintain the submission and exploitation of the
“feminine.” (1977, p. 78). Such a practice is discernible in Irigaray’s own writing, as she undermines meaning and syntax by a series of puns
and wordplays, and unsettles the linearity and
teleology, not only of the texts she reads, but also
of the texts she writes.
Although Irigaray’s theories are complex,
challenging, and frequently misread, her work
provides a revolutionary counter to the empiricist criticism of Anglo-American feminism, by
stressing that it is experience itself which has
to be questioned.

`Irish studies 
Irish studies involves the critical
examination of the cultural, social, economic,
and political practices of the peoples of Ireland
and the Irish diaspora. Perhaps because Irish
culture seems so inextricably related to the political, ethnic, and religious conflicts that have
dominated Irish history, organizations such as the
American Conference for Irish Studies (ACIS)
and the International Association for the Study
of Irish Literatures (IASIL) have taken an interdisciplinary approach to Irish studies for many
years, embracing scholarship in literary studies,
history, anthropology, geography, sociology, film
studies, linguistics, and other disciplines. Fredric
Jameson’s injunction to “always historicize” may
seem an unnecessary reminder in regard to
modern Irish studies, in which history has most
often been seen as an inevitable backdrop for the
understanding of culture. Hundreds of years of
English colonialism in Ireland created a culture
that is arguably at once European and postcolonial
(as is always the case in discussing contemporary
“Ireland,” one must distinguish between the
Republic of Ireland, which gained its independence
from England in 1922, and the six counties of
Northern Ireland, which still remain part of the
United Kingdom). As a result of this history of
conflict, Irish cultural and political rhetoric over
the past two centuries has often been characterized
by longstanding and powerful binary oppositions between Celt and Anglo-Saxon, Catholic and
Protestant, the Irish language and English, rural
and urban, and so on.
Nationalism and questions of identity are
central areas of concern in Irish cultural studies.
A variety of cultural and political positions
founded upon political affiliation and ethnic,
religious, and linguistic allegiances makes the
identification or establishment of one unitary
Irish character or one form of “Irishness” impossible. At the same time, much of the force of Irish
cultural production in the past two centuries has
come from the urge to identify, create, and/or
disrupt some variety of essential Irishness, some

351
and Richard Kearney, and published from 1977
to 1985. This periodical provided a forum for
debates over critical theory and Irish cultural
issues and introduced ideas related to Poststructuralism into many of the theoretical
debates concerning Irish culture. The term “the
fifth province” was first used in The Crane Bag
to denominate a theoretical space outside the
four provinces of Ireland – Connacht, Leinster,
Munster, and Ulster – in which the myths and
rhetoric of Irish culture – particularly of nationalism and unionism, the two dominant political
discourses in Northern Ireland – could be questioned, exposed, and reworked.
The most important cultural studies project in
recent years in Ireland is the Field Day Theatre
Company, now simply known as Field Day.
Field Day was established in the city of Derry in
1980 by a group of Northern Irish intellectuals and
artists from both the Protestant and Catholic
communities, including Brian Friel, Stephen
Rea, Tom Paulin, Seamus Deane, Thomas Kilroy,
and Seamus Heaney. In the plays and pamphlets
it sponsored, Field Day sought to examine the
rhetoric of both unionism and nationalism,
highlighting the intricate relationships between
language, fiction, history, and power. Field Day
hoped to encourage new forms of cultural expression that would acknowledge the multicultural
traditions that compose Irish culture and create
new ways of seeing and speaking about old
problems.
Field Day produced some of the best recent
drama in Ireland, beginning with Brian Friel’s
Translations in 1980, and continues to publish
important monographs by its own members and
by notable cultural critics such as David Lloyd
(1999), Elizabeth Butler Cullingford (2001), and
Marjorie Howes (2006). The publication of the
much-heralded collection The Field Day Anthology
of Irish Writing in 1991 was a significant moment
in Irish studies, bringing together a great amount
of literary, historical, and political writing within
a cultural studies framework that emphasized
relations between different types of discourse –
between popular and elite discourses, between
colonizer and colonized, and so on. This anthology is a remarkable attempt to provide both
primary texts and detailed commentary on Irish
writing from the earliest Irish epics to contemporary Irish writing, a self-conscious effort to

Irish studies

sense of a stable Irish national identity, whether
that identity is based in nationalist visions of
Irishness, in unionist or loyalist desires to assert
Britishness over Irishness, or in a more cosmopolitan and European vision of Ireland. Much
contemporary scholarship in Irish studies
revolves in one way or another around the study
of these various attempts at consolidating or
disrupting versions of Irishness and Irish history
that serve to reify or consolidate one political
position or another. Titles of significant contributions to Irish studies, such as David Lloyd’s
Anomalous States (1993), Declan Kiberd’s Inventing Ireland (1996), Marjorie Howes’s Yeats’s
Nations: Gender, Class, and Irishness (1996),
Seamus Deane’s Strange Country (1997), and
R.F. Foster’s The Irish Story: Telling Tales and
Making It Up in Ireland (2002), indicate this
sense of a series of competing attempts to
define and redefine Irishness or Celticity, from
W.B. Yeats’s “indomitable” Anglo-Irish aristocracy allied with an imaginary Celtic peasantry to
Daniel Corkery’s nationalist vision of a “hidden
Ireland” of Gaelic traditions, to the destabilized
or absurd Irelands of James Joyce, Samuel
Beckett, or Flann O’Brien.
Much Irish cultural studies scholarship tends
to focus on the ideological and semiotic constitution of Irish culture – both unionist and
nationalist – by exploring and articulating the
“mythologies” (in Roland Barthes’s sense of
the word) that undergird that culture. Contemporary writers are casting a critical look back
at nineteenth- and twentieth-century ethnology,
linguistics, political theory, and literary history
to better understand the ways in which culture
served as a battleground for competing ideologies
in Ireland. Nineteenth-century attempts to fashion
one sort of Ireland or another were echoed
by twentieth-century versions of Ireland and
Irishness constructed by varieties of Irish nationalism, by the Irish Literary Revival at the turn
of the century, and by the government of the
Republic of Ireland after independence. Seamus
Deane (1985), David Cairns and Shaun Richards
(1988), Richard Kearney (1988), Declan Kiberd
(1996), and many others have investigated these
various efforts to “write” Ireland.
One particularly influential source for much
of contemporary Irish cultural studies was the
journal The Crane Bag, edited by Mark Hederman

identify and discuss a tradition of Irish writing that
is in fact multicultural, deriving itself from the
various communities that make up Irish cultural
history. The Field Day Anthology stresses the
colonial and postcolonial nature of Irish culture
and includes a wide range of writing from a
variety of historical and political points of view.
The initial three-volume Field Day Anthology
demonstrates many of the complexities and difficulties of Irish cultural studies, however, for
while The Field Day Anthology broke new ground
in establishing a sense of the traditions of Irish
writing, it also exposed traditional lacunae in the
study of Irish culture. The anthology’s muchnoted and most significant flaw was its omission
of important contributions by women, in its
selections both of Irish writers and of section
editors (all of whom are male). The vocal reaction
to this omission underscored the importance
of women’s contributions in cultural studies
and theory in Ireland today, and in 2002, two
additional and corrective volumes of the Field
Day Anthology were published devoted to “Irish
women’s writing and traditions.”
One of the principal critics of the Field Day
Anthology’s omission of women’s writing – Eavan
Boland – serves as a representative example of
the vital contributions Women’s studies and
feminism have made to Irish cultural studies.
Boland is an Irish poet and essayist whose poetry
highlights the role of myth in constructing the
position of women in Ireland. In important
essays such as “Outside History” (1995) and A
Kind of Scar: The Woman Poet in a National
Tradition (1989), she examined the ways in
which nationalism created a mythic association
of Ireland and woman in mythical figures such
as Mother Ireland, Cathleen Ní Houlihan, and
the Dark Rosaleen – all representations of a
beleaguered nation – an association that has in
turn created stereotypes that govern the behavior and social roles of women. The relationship
between nationalism and gender politics has
been a subject of much debate among Irish
feminists, in tandem with practical and theoretical discussions of the social and political status
of women, both in the Republic of Ireland
and in Northern Ireland. Women’s studies and
feminist analysis are central to Irish studies at present; one notable contribution in film is Anne
Crilly’s documentary film Mother Ireland (1989),

which allows a variety of Irish women to speak
on the effects of the equation of nation and
woman in the nationalist tradition.
Critical questions about the history and status
of the Irish language and of literature written in
Irish represent another previously marginalized set
of voices within Irish culture. In her influential
essay “Why I choose to write in Irish, the corpse
that sits up and talks back,” the Irish language
poet Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill linked the suppression of women’s voices and the Irish language
by criticizing “the disgraceful underrepresentation of Irish in the . . . three-volume Field
Day Anthology of Irish Writing.” Irish-speaking
writers and scholars are increasingly calling
attention to contemporary threats to the language and what they see as its central role in
establishing Irish identity.
Irish studies is a thriving and evolving field of
literary and cultural studies. Recent focuses in Irish
studies have included studies of the Irish diaspora,
the impact of multinational investment and
globalization on Irish culture, and the ways in
which an ideal Ireland has been constructed
through advertising to attract international investment and tourism. Irish studies scholars have
also participated in larger discussions of postcolonial cultural dynamics, European immigration,
and whiteness studies (see, for example, Ignatiev,
1995). As Ireland continues to integrate with the
European community and as the political situation in Northern Ireland continues to demand
new and imaginative solutions, Irish studies will
remain a vital and controversial area of inquiry.
Central questions about national identity, the
effects of colonialism and globalization, the
political effects of cultural Discourse, the role
of Popular culture, the status of the Irish
language, and the position of women within
Irish culture will provide subjects for debate in
Irish studies for years to come.

`irony 
A term which has several related but distinct meanings. In its broadest sense, it describes
a situation in which appearance and reality are
in conflict. A specific literary form of such “situational” irony is dramatic or tragic irony where,
for example, the significance of a situation is
hidden from a character but known to the audience. The most celebrated example is Sophocles’
Oedipus Rex. whose hero relentlessly pursues the
murderer of his father without realizing that he
is himself the murderer.
Irony, in a narrower verbal sense, is a figure
of speech in which the intended meaning of an
utterance differs from (usually directly contradicting) its apparent meaning. One of the most
famous literary examples is Antony’s speech in

Julius Caesar in which he convinces his audience
that Caesar was noble and his assassins dishonorable while apparently arguing the opposite. In its
most emphatic form, as in this speech, verbal irony
becomes sarcasm.
Although irony has been a major element in
Western literature since its origins in Greek tragedy, it became centrally important in twentiethcentury criticism. Following I.A. Richards’s
proposal that “irony might provide a kind of test
of the quality of poetry,” the New Critics used it
as a general term of praise for the “complexity”
and “maturity” of attitude which they looked for
in the best poetry.

`Iser, Wolfgang (1926–2007) 
German literary critic and professor of English literature
at the University of Konstanz, Germany, and the
University of California at Irvine. Together with
his colleague at the University of Konstanz,
Hans Robert Jauss, Iser founded the so-called
Konstanz school in the early 1970s, a strand of
reader-oriented Literary criticism steeped in
the German philosophical tradition.
Iser’s Wirkungsästhetik or theory of aesthetic
response (not to be confounded with Jauss’s
Rezeptionsästhetik or reception theory), centers
on the structure of the reading process, on the
inter-subjectively comparable and dynamic interactions between a literary Text and its reader. Iser
calls this structure, which is inscribed in the text
and can therefore be analyzed as part of the text,
the Implied reader.
In Iser’s model of the reading process, meaning is neither arbitrary nor static, but only ever
constituted in the acts of decoding and assimilating
a literary text, through the convergence of text and
reader. Text and reader are seen as two separate poles of a relationship, one of them artistic
(the author’s creation), the other aesthetic (the
reader’s “concretization”). Iser draws on Edmund
Husserl’s Phenomenology as well as on Roman
Ingarden’s phenomenological Aesthetics to
account for the mode of existence of the literary
work. He makes use of Hans-Georg Gadamer’s

Hermeneutics to conceptualize the reader’s
acts of processing a text, and he calls on Gestalt
psychology to sketch out the dynamic interactions
between text and reader.
Ingarden’s notion of a literary text contains
a concept of stratification; he holds that any text
consists of several textual layers, each comprising
a series of schemata, patterns, and strategies.
Ingarden’s view of literature is indebted to the
classical concept of Art as a symbolic representation of Organic unity. Thus the function
he ascribes to the various strata in the text is
to orchestrate a “polyphonic harmony,” which
means that the different strata must be processed
in such a way that they can chime with one
another. Lively interactions between text and
reader are hardly possible here; the text dominates
the reader, and processing the disparate layers
is an activity subordinated to the guidance of
the text. Iser incorporates Ingarden’s concept of
stratification into his own theory, but turns it
upside down by emphasizing those very features
Ingarden neglects: the breaks, gaps, and blanks
between the various layers and segments of the
text. In Iser’s theory, contoured “points of indeterminacy” instigate, contain, and, to a certain
degree, delimit the reading process. These textual
features stimulate the reader to produce meanings
which could not otherwise come into existence,
meanings with a dimension of virtuality. The
reader is brought to formulate the as yet unformulated, as Iser has it. By introducing the
concepts of textual indeterminacy and the virtual
dimension of literary meaning, Iser has brought
two new and stimulating notions to the study
of literature.
Iser defines the pole of the reader, the individual
acts of processing the text, by drawing on
hermeneutics. Each sentence that is read opens up
a horizon of perception which will in due course
be confirmed, challenged, or undermined. The
information gained on one page will fade out on
the next, or be called upon and modified. Using
data provided by what he or she has already
read and making assumptions about what is still
to come, the reader tries to wrest meaning from
the text, to grasp it through a series of everchanging viewpoints and horizons.
Iser uses some of the theoretical propositions
of Gestalt psychology to conceptualize the dynamic
interactions between text and reader. Gestalt

psychology holds that the human mind does not
perceive things as unrelated bits and pieces but
only ever as meaningful and organized wholes.
Gestalt psychology explores the ontology (structure, form, unity, configuration) of such Gestalten
as “figures” standing out against a “ground.”
According to Iser, the interactions between text
and reader consist of a highly complex process
in which, on the one hand, the reader endeavors
to convert open, and thus inherently unstable
Gestalten into closed, stable ones, while, on the
other hand, the text with its contradictions,
negations, and points of indeterminacy tries to
undermine that very attempt: that is to say,
many of the Gestalten, well formed as they may
at first appear to the reader, will have to be
undone again in the course of the reading process with its ever fluctuating horizons, they will
have to be broken up, revised, reconstructed,
and maybe abandoned altogether. In his attempt
to make sense of the text, the reader will select
certain textual elements and assemble them into
seemingly consistent wholes. He will exclude
some elements and foreground others. He will
try to hold different perspectives or move from
one perspective to the next. Iser does not leave
the reader entirely free to impose meaning on
the text, nor does he let the text dominate the
reader, but sees their interaction as a fairly even
game (see Reader-response criticism).
Iser’s ultimate interest lies in the realm of
anthropology. Reading, for Iser, constitutes an
encounter with the yet unknown and results in a
continuous testing of our capacities and boundaries, an enlarging and refining of our cognitive
faculties. In short, reading is seen as a uniquely
valuable consciousness-raising activity.
By being indebted to hermeneutics, which
stresses the centrality of consciousness in all our
acts of understanding, and to phenomenology,
which studies the essence of phenomena as they
sift into and subsequently form sediments in our
consciousness, Iser’s theory also overemphasizes
our cognitive interaction with a literary text. The
fact that our unconscious, our emotions, and/or
our Gender may play an important role in how
we interact with the world and process literary texts
is hardly ever reflected in his work.
Nevertheless, Iser’s theory of aesthetic response,
being well grounded in German philosophy,
is cogent, coherent, and comprehensive. Even

`Islamic philosophy 
A philosophical tradition
whose historical, linguistic, and religious parameters are still a matter of some dispute. The
tradition is referred to variously as “Arabic,”
“Islamic,” or “Muslim” philosophy. These names
are sometimes used interchangeably, although
they have different implications. The concept of
an “Arabic philosophy” can be traced back to the
medieval Christian Latins, who used the term to
describe the enormous body of philosophical
work that they appropriated from Islamic lands.
It is first and foremost a linguistic, rather than
ethnic or geographical, category. Nineteenthand twentieth-century orientalists inherited the
rubric, and even today a significant number of
scholars – mostly Western, but not exclusively –
continue to employ it. Yet over the past fifty years
or so, it has encountered increasing suspicion.
There are numerous reasons for this, some
of which simply have to do with contingent facts
about the term’s effective history. One is that
the traditional framework of Arabic philosophy
tended arbitrarily to privilege the classical period,
specifically those thinkers who were most influenced by Greek philosophy. The standard story
was that Arabic philosophy emerged in the ninth
century out of the great Greco-Arabic translation
project, was inspired by Greek philosophy (which
provided it with its central concepts and techniques), and was shaped to a large extent by

the increasingly evident tensions between reason
and faith. Much ink was spilled, for example,
over questions concerning the createdness or
eternality of the world, the nature of God, the
existence of divine attributes over and above
God’s essence, God’s causal relation to the world,
whether God knows temporal particulars (and thus
is aware of what we do, rewarding and punishing us in an appropriate way), the nature of the
human soul or intellect and its afterlife, the good
life for human beings, and whether the tools of
logic can help us achieve certainty independently
of divine revelation.
According to traditional accounts of Arabic
philosophy, its founding figure was al-Kindc,
who played a pivotal role in the translation
movement, legitimized the appropriation of
foreign wisdom, and was the first to weld Greek
philosophical doctrines onto the worldview of
Islam. Its two most representative figures were
the Peripatetic (mashshA’C) philosophers al-Farabc
(L: Alfarabius) and Ibn Scna (L: Avicenna), who
internalized Greek logic and constructed the
ambitious metaphysical systems that synthesized
Aristotelian, Neoplatonic, and Islamic ideas. Its
bête noir was the Ash‘arite theologian and tefc
mystic al-Ghazalc, who critiqued the philosophers
according to their own methods of proof and
ultimately accused them of unbelief. Its final
flowering was the great Andalusian polymath
Ibn Rushd (L: Averroës), who provided a powerful response to al-Ghazalc’s criticisms and went
on to retrieve the true sense of Aristotle’s
thought through his extensive commentarial
project. However, by that time the tide had
effectively turned against philosophy in the
Islamic world, according to the traditional
Western account. After the death of Ibn Rushd
at the end of the twelfth century, it was quickly
eclipsed by theology and mysticism. Anomalies
like Ibn Khalden aside, philosophical thought
had run its course in the Islamic world. Luckily,
the achievements of Arabic philosophers had
begun to be recognized by Christian scholars,
and another ambitious translation project – this
time from Arabic to Latin – was initiated. The
Scholastic tradition profited enormously from
the translations, commentaries, and careful systematic interpretations they inherited. In short,
Arabic philosophers preserved Greek learning
during a period of intellectual stultification in

literary criticism. It continues to exert an evergrowing influence on the development of readerresponse criticism.

the West and ultimately made it possible for
Christian Europe to reconnect with, and gather
vitality from, its classical roots. Indeed, the chief
value of Arabic philosophy lay in its preservative
and transmissive role: apart from that it contributed little of new value to the Greek heritage
(Boer, 1901/67; Walzer, 1962).
This story is not entirely wrong: Greek thought
did indeed have a considerable early impact on
Arabic philosophy, there were significant conceptual tensions between Greek philosophical
doctrines and Islamic revelation, and Christian
scholars certainly put the achievements of Arabic
philosophers to good use. However, it is misleading
for several reasons. I shall set aside the more
heavy-handed Orientalist assumptions scattered
throughout this story and focus only on points
of direct and obvious philosophical relevance
(for discussions of the former, see Said, 1979;
Mahdi, 1990).
First, in focusing predominately on Greek
influences, accounts of this sort cannot help but
underestimate the original and unique indigenous
contributions of philosophers in the Islamic
milieu, as well as the Qur’anic, pre-Islamic Arab,
Persian, and Indian sources they also drew upon.
Al-Kindc’s prophetic dictum that we should take
the truth wherever we find it applies not just to
the Greeks, but to any nation or people from which
Muslims might gain knowledge. Further, by
valorizing the achievements of Arabic philosophy
primarily in terms of their instrumental utility for
European beneficiaries, we overlook the intrinsic
value of the tradition as understood on its own
terms. Indeed, it forces us to view the tradition
in a very selective and distorted way, since what
may have been important to the Latins was not
always as important to their Arabic brethren,
and vice versa. A case in point here would be
Ibn Rushd. In Western histories, he is cast as
the final, enormously important figure in the
Arabic philosophical lineage. And he was important – first to the Scholastics, then to European
Enlightenment thinkers, and later to Arab
modernists. In Islamic accounts, however, he is
generally a peripheral figure with no real students
– just one relatively minor moment in a tradition
that continues beyond the twelfth century up
to the present day. His reply to al-Ghazalc’s
critique of Ibn Scna had very little impact within
the Islamic context, as compared, for example, to

al-uesc’s replies to al-Sharastanc’s and Fakhr
al-Dcn al-Razc’s critique of Ibn Scna, which were
enormously influential. Traditional Western
accounts of Arabic philosophy can thus diverge
radically at crucial junctures from the effective history of philosophy within the Islamic tradition.
A second problem with this model is that it
overstates the conflict between philosophy and
religion. This not difficult to do, especially if one
views it through a Christian lens. Yet historically,
philosophy within the Islamic tradition has been
neither as central nor as doctrinally constrained
as its Christian counterpart. Although it has
had its historical moments of impressive political patronage (eighth- through tenth-century
Baghdad under the ‘Abbasid caliphate, twelfthcentury Andalusia under Almoravid and Almohad
rule, sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Ixfahan
under tafavid rule, etc.), it has generally occupied
a more peripheral and less important position than
such traditional Islamic sciences as jurisprudence
( fiqh), Qur’anic exegesis (tafsCr), prophetic traditions (WadCth) or even speculative theology (“ilm
al-kalAm). At the same time, philosophy maintained a much greater degree of autonomy from
religious authority, in part perhaps because of its
own critical temperament, but also because of its
relatively marginal status and the decentralized
structure of Islam itself. Individual scholars of the
traditional sciences (“ulamA’) may have critiqued
particular aspects of philosophy (al-Ghazalc,
Ibn Taymiyya) and even issued fatwas declaring
the impermissibility of philosophy and logic in
general (Ibn al-talaw), but there is no Islamic
equivalent to, for example, the Catholic Church’s
Condemnation of 1277.
One can certainly find an indigenous distinction within the Islamic world between intellect
( “aql ) and tradition (naql ) as two different ways
to arrive at or justify a belief. However, this
distinction does not map on easily to the usual
Western opposition between reason and authority based on revelation or tradition. For instance,
Islamic “traditionalists” have historically accused
“rationalists” of blind obedience (taqlCd). They
thought that Greek-influenced philosophers
were often aping their foreign predecessors without really demonstrating their conclusions. This
charge will seem perplexing to contemporary
Western philosophers, who may assume that
traditionalism is synonymous with unquestioning

357
so desperately to conceal their doctrines from
religio-political authorities. Traditionalist scholars
may have been skeptical of the philosophers’
assurances and irked by their apparent elitism
– indeed, they condemned their methods and
conclusions more than once – but there is little
historical evidence that philosophers were ever
actually persecuted, let alone executed, for their
opinions.
A third problem with the received Western
account of Arabic philosophy is that it makes
the philosophical tradition of the Islamic world
appear much more homogeneous and monolithic
than it really is. Almost without exception, the
central philosophers in this account belonged
to the aforementioned Peripatetic school, which
was most indebted to the Greeks. But even
within the classical period, there was a plurality
of diverse intellectual movements and schools:
the Mu‘tazilite and Ash‘arite theologians, the
Isma‘clcs, the tefcs, and the school of Illumination (ishrAq). In addition to these, there were
various uncategorizable freethinkers, as well
as traditionalist jurists and theologians who
mounted sophisticated attacks on the philosophers.
At the end of this period (the close of the twelfth
century) philosophy was for the most part subsumed by theology and mysticism in the Sunnc
world (at least for several centuries), but that did
not signal its death in the Islamic world overall.
Philosophy continued to flourish in Shi‘itedominated areas (most notably, Persia), as well
as in India and Turkey. Independent figures and
new syncretic but systematic schools of philosophy emerged well into the modern period,
culminating in the ambitious metaphysical
synthesis of the school of Ixfahan. The Rebirth
or Renaissance (naWda) of the nineteenth century
then signaled a reawakening of philosophy in the
Sunnc Arab world in response to its engagement
with the West. A wide variety of philosophical
schools, movements, and projects have subsequently proliferated in the twentieth century,
some as an after-effect of the naWda, some rooted
in centuries-old traditions of thought (for a
useful overview by region, see the final section
of Nasr and Leaman, 1996).
Of course, few contemporary advocates of the
“Arabic philosophy” model would now maintain that it begins and ends with the classical
period, that its concerns are reducible to the

Islamic philosophy

acceptance of historical or religious authority.
Yet figures perceived as clear-cut traditionalists
or rationalists in the West are often considerably
more ambiguous figures within the Islamic context itself. Take, for instance, two of the greatest
Andalusian thinkers, Ibn sazm and the aforementioned Ibn Rushd. Ibn sazm has often been
portrayed in Western accounts as a kind of archtraditionalist, in part because of his affiliation
with the vahirite theological-juridical school,
which was notoriously literalist and insisted on
privileging the apparent or external (ZAhir) sense
of religious texts. Yet his views on logic and
various theological disputes are actually quite
subtle and moderate and he is in fact viewed by
many contemporary Arab intellectuals as part of
the rationalist legacy of Islam. Ibn Rushd, on the
other hand, is often cast in Western histories as
the consummate rationalist and even a harbinger
of secular modernity. Yet he belonged to the
Malckite school of jurisprudence (one of the most
conservative of the four Sunnc religious legal
movements) and was appointed as the Grand
Judge of Cordoba – a position that could only be
attained by someone with an unrivaled knowledge
of and commitment to Islamic law (sharC“a). The
reality is that Ibn Rushd, like most philosophers
in the Islamic world, saw the claims of reason
and revelation as dovetailing harmoniously
(contrary to later misinterpretations of the Latin
Averroists). Accordingly, the distinction between
philosophical proof, theological disputation,
and prophetic revelation was oftentimes cast in
terms of the intended audience and appropriate
method of communication (apodictic demonstration, dialectic, and rhetoric) rather than the
actual content or significance of the message
itself.
A more specific version of the philosophy–
religion conflict thesis was articulated by the
Straussian school, which emphasized the primacy
of philosophers’ political aims and the necessity
of the “art of writing” (Strauss, 1952/88; Butterworth, 1992; Mahdi, 2001). This is an influential
approach that has nonetheless generated a good
deal of criticism (Leaman, 1985/2001; Gutas,
2002). Setting aside the debate over whether
Arabic philosophers employed esoteric strategies
of writing to protect themselves (and if so, who
is qualified to decide what they actually meant),
the question is whether they really needed

Islamic philosophy

358
clash between reason and revelation, or that it is
merely an unimaginative reiteration of classical
Greek insights valuable only for its preservative
function (see, for example, Gutas, 2002; Adamson
and Taylor, 2005; McGinnis and Reisman, 2007;
for thoughtful defenses of this rubric). There are,
however, lingering problems with the idea of
Arabic philosophy. The first is that despite the
ad hoc way in which the category has been
expanded to embrace post-classical developments,
it remains too narrow to do justice to the diverse
tradition sketched out above. Some critics of the
term have pointed out that very few philosophers before the modern period were actually
Arab (most were Persian, some Turkish, Indian,
etc.). This, however, misses the point, since as
mentioned before the “Arabic” classification has
always been first and foremost linguistic. And
there is little question that Arabic was the lingua
franca of philosophical discussion during the
classical period. Yet even then, key works were
written in Persian as well (e.g. by Ibn Scna),
and in the post-classical period the majority of
philosophical texts were in fact composed in
languages other than Arabic (again, most notably
Persian, but also Turkish, Urdu, French, and
English, among others).
The second point is more substantive. Advocates of the “Arabic” rubric generally see the
Greco-Arabic translation movement as the formative moment in the tradition, and thus place
a great premium on the Greek origins of Arabic
philosophy. This is understandable, since the
Greeks are generally taken (at least in the West)
to be the progenitors of philosophy. Indeed,
Epicurus bragged that “only Greeks philosophize.”
But can there be non-Greek forms of philosophy?
Specifically, can there be forms of philosophical
endeavor in the Islamic world that do not derive
from, or even independently approximate, the
practice of philosophy produced by the Greeks?
To ask this question is to ask what philosophy is,
or what it ought to be, and who gets to decide
that. One might maintain that only theoretical
reflection and ethical cultivation pursued in the
classical Greek mode constitutes genuine philosophy. But in that case, many other rich intellectual traditions would be entirely eliminated
or at least disfigured beyond recognition. For
instance, there is no indigenous word analogous
to philosophy in either classical Sanskrit or

Chinese, and neither the traditional Indian
darManas nor the Chinese masters would fit the
Procrustean bed of the Greeks very comfortably.
Indeed, the vast majority of what is considered
philosophy in the European tradition would
probably be excluded according to this criterion.
The Arabic philosophical tradition occupies
a unique place with regard to this question,
because since the beginning of the classical period
there have been two distinct and etymologically
unrelated words for philosophy. One is a loan
word from the Greek: falsafa (an Arabization
of philosophia, lit. “love of wisdom”). This term
was most often used to describe the thinking and
way of life of the Greek-influenced philosophers
( falAsifa) during the classical period. The second
term is an indigenous one that appears in the
Qur’an numerous times: Wikma or “wisdom.”
This is used side by side with falsafa during the
classical period and with even greater frequency
after that.
From a classical Greek philosophical perspective, the claim that one is already in possession
of wisdom rather than merely desiring and
pursuing it might seem indefensibly hubristic (as
sophists or “wise men” often appear in Platonic
dialogues). Yet the WakCm is not a sophistBs.
Philosophers in the Islamic tradition have generally believed that the point of pursuing wisdom
is precisely to attain it and enact it, in order to
transform and perfect the self (the soteriological
function of knowledge is a common theme among
most schools). Further, Wikma casts a much
wider epistemic net than falsafa. It encompasses
not just the rational argumentation, conceptual
analysis and demonstrative proofs of the Greekinfluenced philosophers, but other ostensive
sources of knowledge: divine revelation and its
exegesis, prophecy, traditions, dialectical speculative theology, authoritative esoteric teachings,
intuitive insights, mystical experience, spiritual
exercises, and ethical self-cultivation.
Whether or not such things ought legitimately
to be considered philosophy is a contentious
question (see Nasr, 2006, and Gutas, 2002, for
opposing perspectives). It is worth bearing in
mind that one could just as easily pose that question about contemporary philosophical activity
in Europe or the Americas, none of which preserves the whole character of Greek philosophia
as a technB tou biou or “art of living.” Indeed,

359
one another. That essential antagonism has now
been replaced by an essential peace, attained
only by stripping philosophy of its intellectual
autonomy and subordinating it to revealed truths.
The question is then whether a philosophy that
is merely the handmaid of theology does not
cease to be philosophy altogether.
Further, while the category of Islamic philosophy appears to be a more inclusive category than
that of Arabic philosophy, one may ask whether
it is in some respects too inclusive. Some critics
of this approach have complained that it ends
up granting primacy to the mystical, esoteric,
and even exegetical elements of the tradition, at
the expense of logical analysis, rational disputation,
and independent critical inquiry (Gutas, 2002).
Indeed, philosophy is redefined so broadly here
that it becomes synonymous with any kind of intellectual or spiritual activity. As mentioned earlier,
Islamic philosophy must be approached first on
its own terms and not simply crammed into
alien categories if it is to be properly appreciated.
But this is not to say that emic perspectives automatically trump etic perspectives, or cannot be held
accountable to anything other than their own
unexamined assumptions. Such a claim would be
sheer dogmatism and deeply unphilosophical. It
is thus still legitimate – indeed, it is incumbent
on us when engaging in cross-cultural philosophy
– to ask again and again the question of what
philosophy is and what it ought to be.
An additional problem with the “Islamic”
rubric is that not all thinkers in this tradition
produced philosophical work that was actually
Islamic, in the sense of being “derived directly from
the Islamic revelation” (Nasr, 1996, p. 37, n.1).
While a great many philosophers in this milieu
have certainly perceived themselves as deeply
religious people, it was not uncommon for them
to be accused of illegitimate innovation (bid“a)
or even unbelief (kufr) by more traditionalist
voices. To dismiss such criticisms as provincial or unrepresentative would be grossly to
underestimate their sophistication, authority,
and influence. Many philosophers did arguably
introduce intellectual innovations that took
considerable liberties with the apparent sense
of scripture. Particularly during the classical
period, the aforementioned harmony between
philosophy and Islam was often achieved by bending the latter to the former: many effectively

Islamic philosophy

it would seem that Arabic philosophy honors
this conception much more genuinely despite
modern Western conceits about our GrecoRoman lineage. The crucial point, though, is
that this is how philosophy came to be conceived within the Islamic milieu. And if it is to
be understood properly, it must be understood
first on its own terms and not simply crammed
into the heteronomous categories of Greek
philosophy or contemporary Western academic
practices. The attempt to legislate what is and is
not genuine philosophy based on our current
assumptions, methods, and concerns – or to
acknowledge other traditions only to the extent
that they approximate those privileged characteristics – is provincial and dogmatic at best.
More often than not, it is merely a thinly veiled
form of cultural imperialism.
For any number of these reasons, many
scholars have abandoned the category of “Arabic
philosophy” altogether and instead speak of
“Islamic” philosophy (Corbin, 1964; Fakhry,
1970; Leaman and Nasr, 1996). This rubric
seems to cast the net more widely, and it certainly
captures some of the movements and historical
developments that “Arabic philosophy” has
typically excluded (e.g. the Isma‘clcs, philosophically informed Ash‘arite theology, traditionalist
critics, the ishrAqC school, philosophical tefism,
various later Shi‘ite syntheses). Advocates of this
taxonomy emphasize that Islamic philosophy is
not simply a short-lived medieval phenomenon,
but a flourishing vital tradition that continues to
this day. One further advantage of this approach
is that it attempts to do justice to the profound
and unique influence that Islam has exercised
upon philosophy. Yet in doing so, it oftentimes
exaggerates the religious dimension.
Henri Corbin characterized Islamic philosophy
as la philosophie prophétique: “a philosophy
whose development, and whose modalities are
essentially linked to the religious and spiritual
fact of Islam” (Corbin, 1964, pp. xiv–xv). In a
similar vein, Seyyed Hossein Nasr defends the
idea that Islamic philosophy is derived directly
from Islamic revelation, describing it as “essentially a philosophical hermeneutics of the Sacred
Text” (Nasr, 1996, p. 37). But this is simply the
inverted mirror image of the modern Western
assumption that philosophy and religion are by
their very nature distinct and antagonistic towards

Islamic studies

360
made revelation answerable to the claims of
reason. Some even eschewed key Islamic tenets
such as the reality of prophecy, the immortality of the soul, and the prospect of reward and
punishment in an afterlife. This is not to deny the
enormous significance and influence of Islam on
philosophy. Sometimes philosophical reflection
has preserved and clarified and defended Islamic
doctrines and practices, sometimes it has appropriated and reinterpreted them, and sometimes
it has critiqued and rejected them. It should be
noted as well that sometimes it simply has had
nothing to do with them, as is the case with the
enormous body of work on logic. To insist that
all thought that emerged within the Islamic
world is somehow directly derived from (or even
always in accordance with) Qur’anic revelation,
and thus that it is essentially and steadfastly
Islamic, would be to ignore or radically misrepresent some of its most important and influential
voices. In short, the “Islamic” rubric makes the
tradition appear much more univocal than it
really is.
For these reasons, some scholars have preferred
to employ the more cautious rubric of “Muslim”
philosophy (Sharif, 1961/99). This would then
encompass all philosophy created by those who
called themselves Muslims, setting aside the
question of whether their philosophy was really
strictly speaking Islamic in the aforementioned
sense. This constitutes an improvement over the
religious essentialism of the “Islamic” rubric,
but it remains too narrow, because a significant
number of thinkers who were not even nominally
Muslim played a considerable role in this tradition as teachers, translators, and philosophical
interlocutors. Some important Arabic-speaking
philosophers in the Islamic world were Jews,
some were Christians, some were pagan Sabians,
and some were zanAdiqa, i.e. Manichean dualists
or, more loosely, heretical freethinkers. A number
of this last group evinced a strong skepticism
and hostility toward revealed religions, not excepting Islam. In this respect at least, the “Arabic”
rubric is actually preferable to the “Islamic” and
“Muslim” taxonomies, since it recognizes a good
many figures that they would exclude.
Ultimately, the most appropriate rubric for
capturing the unique diversity of this intellectual tradition might simply be Marshall G. S.
Hodgson’s awkward but useful term “Islamicate,”

which “refer[s] not directly to the religion, Islam,
itself, but to the social and cultural complex historically associated with Islam and the Muslims,
both among Muslims themselves and even when
found among non-Muslims” (Hodgson, 1974,
vol. 1, p. 59). Applied to the study of philosophy,
it would encompass any thought that emerges
within a societal context predominately informed
by the religious, political, and cultural dimensions
of Islam, whether or not its presuppositions and
conclusions are necessarily Islamic. This casts
the net widely enough to capture the entirety of
the tradition, without pretending to subordinate
all the diverse forms of philosophical inquiry to
the revealed truths of Islam, or ignoring nonMuslims who played an important role in the
historical dialogue. It also remains truer to the
protean spirit of philosophy, by signifying a
provisional starting point, rather than making
monolithic claims about its doctrines, the behavior of the people who produce it, or even the
language through which it is expressed.

Islamic studies Given the vast scope of
Islamic studies, in terms of subject matter, history, and geography, this brief account will limit
itself to indicating certain crucial developments
and suggesting the ways in which major modern
theories have begun to make incursions into
analyses of Islam. Traditionally, Islamic scholarship

361
thought: the Neoplatonists al-Farabi (Alfarabius)
(870–950) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037);
the sharply nonconformist al-Razi (Rhazes) (d.
923?); al-Ghazali (1058 –1111) who attempted
to reconcile orthodox Islamic doctrine with the
mystical insights of Sufism; and the Aristotelian
Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (1126–98).
There has also existed a vast body of exegesis
of the Qur’an, ranging from the early commentary of Ibn Jarir al-Tabari (838–922) to the
unfinished work of the Egyptian modernist
Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849–1905) and the interpretations of Abul Kalam Azad (1888–1958) and
Kenneth Cragg. The problems – of historical
contextualization, etymology, and law – occupying these commentators have overlapped to some
extent with those confronted by translators of the
Qur’an. Characteristic problems have included:
the abrogation of certain earlier verses by subsequent revelations; the chronology and coherence
of the whole; the historical departure of some
Arabic words from their original meaning in the
Qur’an; and the semantic comprehensiveness
or distinctness of certain Arabic words, equally
resistant to translation.
On a broader level, the history of translation
of the Qur’an reveals that the study of Islam
has been a phenomenon of Western politics,
scholarship, and thought as much as it has been
a governing imperative of the Islamic political, cultural, and legal world. Modern critical
approaches in particular have been conducted
largely by Western scholars, especially by Muslims
trained in Western as well as Eastern traditions.
The first Western translation of the Qur’an
was completed in 1143 by the English scholar
Robertus Retenensis, under direction from Peter
the Venerable, Abbot of Cluny. Motivated by
hostile intentions, this version was profoundly
inaccurate yet served as the basis for early
European translations. Equally distinguished by
its inaccuracies was Alexander Ross’s English
rendering of the 1647 French translation published
by André du Ryer. Ross offered no claim to
scholarly impartiality, urging in his preface that
the Qur’an was a repository of follies which
would confirm the “health” of Christianity. In
1649 the Arabic text of the Qur’an was published
in Hamburg; availing himself of this as well as a
new Latin version (1698) by Ludovico Maracci,
George Sale produced a more accurate English

Islamic studies

has occupied a number of areas: translating,
editing, and interpreting the Qur’an, revered by
Muslims as the Word of God revealed to the
Prophet Muhammad; compiling and assessing
the authenticity of the Hadith or sayings of the
Prophet; producing increasingly accurate biographies of the Prophet; rediscovering, editing,
and translating works of Islamic literature and
philosophy; and analyzing the historically complex connections between Islamic and European
Culture.
Islam (meaning “submission” to the will of
God) is characterized primarily by its uncompromising monotheism, its absolute insistence that
God is One, and that the Prophet Muhammad
was His final messenger to humankind. It sees
itself as continuing what is true in Judaism and
Christianity and reveres the Hebrew prophets,
including Christ. Its main prescriptions and
tenets include the profession of faith, prayer,
fasting, pilgrimage, charity to the poor, humility,
honesty in trade, personal cleanliness, and the
absolute spiritual equality of all human beings
before God. Islam is officially dated back to
622 ad, the year of the Hijra or the Prophet’s
flight from Mecca (the town in Arabia where he
was born) to Medina to escape persecution by
the Meccan traders, whose lifestyle and profit
were threatened by the new religion. It was in
610 ad that Muhammad experienced his first
Divine revelation in the cave of Hira outside of
Mecca. This and subsequent revelations were compiled, shortly after the Prophet’s death, into the
Qur’an, which literally means “recitation.” This
book, whose Arabic text has survived unchanged
for over 14 centuries, is the primary source of
authority in Islam, complemented, sometimes
problematically, by the Hadith and the historically
developed Canons of Islamic law or Shari‘a.
The long traditions of Islamic theology and
philosophy, flourishing from the eighth to the
thirteenth centuries and stagnating somewhat
thereafter, were highly eclectic, drawing on Greek,
Persian, and Christian thought. Their concerns
overlapped considerably with those of Christian
theology: free will, predestination, anthropomorphism, the nature of the Divinity, the connections between human and Divine law, and the
reconciliation of reason and revelation. Many of
the thinkers prominent in these traditions have long
been known through their influence on Western

version in 1734. Again, Sale’s endeavors were
polemical regarding both Islam and Catholicism:
he viewed the exposure of the “imposture” of
Islam and its overthrow as a “glory” reserved
for Protestants. Sale’s was the standard text for
English readers until the late nineteenth century;
it was the version which stood behind Edward
Gibbon’s ambivalent assessment of Muhammad.
The methods of the Higher Criticism, applied
to the Christian Gospels in the nineteenth century, eventually made their impact on Qur’anic
translation and exegesis: J.M. Rodwell’s translation changed the order of the Suras or Qur’anic
chapters and his assessment of Muhammad as
inspired by a sincere monotheism was certainly
more impartial and “scientific” than that of his
predecessors. Other notable translations have
included those by Henry Edward Palmer (1880)
and Marmaduke Pickthall (1930), an English
convert to Islam. A.J. Arberry’s version (1955)
attempts to recapture the rhetorical and rhythmical
patterns which lie behind the splendor of the
original. Since then, numerous other renderings
have appeared, some by Muslim scholars such
as Abdullah Yousuf Ali. These have attempted to
grapple with the problems enumerated above in
the light of increasingly sophisticated historical
and philological research, as well as the need to
translate the spirit of the Qur’an into idioms of
relevance to the twentieth century.
In general, Western studies of Islam progressed from viewing it in the twelfth century
as a Christian heresy or a false religion to more
systematic and disciplined approaches in the
late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The
following account of these trends is indebted in
part to Albert Hourani’s splendid book Islam in
European Thought (1991). From 1587 Arabic was
taught at the Collège de France in Paris. Chairs
of Arabic were established at the Universities of
Leiden (1613), Cambridge (1632), and Oxford
(1634). Eventually, clearer pictures of the Prophet
of Islam emerged, acknowledging at least his
inspired message and the historical role of his
reaffirmation of Divine unity. Such assessments
were offered in Simon Ockley’s The History of the
Saracens (1718) and F.D. Maurice’s The Religions
of the World and Their Relations with Christianity
(1847). However, portrayals of Islam as a dangerous threat to Christianity have persisted into
the twentieth century: William Muir’s The Life of

Muhammed (1912) remained a standard text for
many years.
Until the nineteenth century, accounts of Islam
were generally based on the Qur’an, the Prophet’s
life, and the view that Islam was spread by the
sword. Some of the first attempts to see Islam in
the broader context of world history were made
by J.G. Herder (1744–1803) and G.W.F. Hegel
(1770–1831). Hegel saw Islam’s assertion of
an utterly transcendent Divinity as an essential
stage of world history but one which had to
be sublated by a more dialectical connection of
immanence and transcendence between human
and Divine (Hegel, 1956, pp. 356–7). Also in
the nineteenth century arose the “science” of
comparative philology: the close study of languages and their meanings in their mutual connections. Prominent figures in this development
were Franz Bopp (1791–1876) and especially
Ernest Renan (1823–92) who believed that particular languages embodied given possibilities
of cultural development. He saw Islam as a
“closed” religion, locked in an abstract perception
of divine unity and impervious to refinement
or development through science, philosophy,
or Art. Like Hegel, he saw Europe as bearing
the burden of future world-historical progress.
Renan’s Life of Jesus (1863) developed the Higher
Critical techniques embodied in David Strauss’s
Life of Jesus (1835). Both works attempted to
examine the Gospels in their historical context,
with attention to questions of their coherence
and veracity. These methods were brought into
the study of Islam by Julius Wellhausen (1844–
1918), Silvestre de Sacy (1758–1838), Ignaz
Goldziher (1850–1921), and Louis Massignon
(1883–1962). Renan had refused to view the
life of Christ as a series of isolated incidents
generating a completely new religion; rather, he
placed that life in a broader historical development from Hebrew traditions (Renan, 1955,
pp. 388–93). Likewise, these analysts placed the
Qur’an, the Hadith, and the life of the Prophet in
a more comprehensive cultural context, examining, for example, the connections between Islam
and pre-Islamic Arabia in their actual complex continuity rather than viewing Islam as a
complete break from the past. In England, the
tradition of Islamic studies acquired strength
only in the nineteenth century from figures
such as W. Wright (1830–89), R.A. Nicholson

identity, he argues that religious Ideology did
not overwhelmingly transform Arab societies:
many factors of economic life and the vicissitudes
of political power were impervious to religious
adherence or the norms of Islam (Rodinson,
1980, pp. xiv, xxxiv–xxxix). Marshall Hodgson’s
The Venture of Islam (1974) is an ambitious
attempt to rethink the role of Islam in world
history, attributing to it a cultural predominance
and independence lasting into the nineteenth
century.
What might loosely be called “modernistic”
interpretations of Islam, which attempt to reconcile
Islamic teachings with modern thought, date
back to the late nineteenth century. Prominent in
the development of such endeavors were Jamal
al-Din Afghani (1839–97) and his especially
renowned disciple Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849–
1905), who attempted a reinterpretation of the
Qur’an in the light of reason, arguing that Islam
is a tolerant and humane religion. In India,
Sir Sayyed Ahmed Khan (1817–98) advocated
a modern approach to education and helped
found Aligarh University with a view to providing
access to Western thought within an Islamic
context. The Egyptian statesman, scholar, and
writer Taha Hussein (b. 1889) applied modern
exegetical methods to classical Arabic Texts,
arousing fierce opposition from traditional
scholars. Sayyed Amir ‘Ali urged fresh readings
of the Qur’an freed from the closed readings of
the ‘Ulama or religious elite. He argued, for
example, that polygamy was implicitly condemned by the Qur’an.
A major figure in Islamic modernism was
Sir Muhammad Iqbal (1876–1938), the greatest
Urdu poet of the twentieth century, who also wrote
in Persian. His lectures entitled The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam (1934)
represent an important attempt to recast Islamic
doctrine in the light of modern Western thought.
Drawing on Nietzsche, Bergson, and the Persian
mystical poet Rumi, Iqbal reacts against what he
perceives as the fatalism and asceticism which have
come to dominate Islamic thought: he affirms
the reality of the creative self which aspires
towards the highest individuality, that of God
(Iqbal, 1978, pp. xvii–xix; 1934, p. 181). Recent
modernistic discussions of Islam have included
Fazlur Rahman’s Islam and Modernity (1982),
which argues for a holistic critical and rational

Islamic studies

(1868–1945), D.S. Margoliouth (1858–1940),
and H.A.R. Gibb (1895–1971).
While these scholars continued to apply the
methods of philological and cultural analysis,
the more recent generations of scholars, social
scientists, and anthropologists have begun to
apply Marxist, sociological, feminist, modernist,
and even deconstructive and psychoanalytical
methods to the study of all aspects of Islam.
These newer approaches have entailed a questioning of the motives and methods of Orientalism
as well as the use of “Islam” as an explanatory
category. Clifford Geertz addresses the dilemma
of the unity and identity of Islam in his Islam
Observed (1968). André Raymond’s work refers
historical developments in Egypt to economic
conditions rather than to “Islam.” Max Weber’s
theses concerning both Christianity and Islam
have generated some important Marxist and sociological analyses of Islam. In The Protestant Ethic
and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber had correlated
the rise of capitalism to a large extent with the
rationalism and “this-worldliness” of Calvinism
and Lutheranism (Weber, 1978, pp. 174–6); this
position had contradicted Marx’s and Engels’s
materialist explanation of capitalist development
which, however, had been very incompletely
extended to Islamic societies. Maxime Rodinson’s
Islam and Capitalism (1978) rejects the idea that
capitalism failed to develop in Islamic societies as
a result of Qur’anic injunctions or proscriptions
in the Hadith or Shari‘a. He argues, rather, that
capitalist development was stunted by the state’s
domination of trade relations, the self-sufficiency
of local village economies, and nomadic invasions.
Other important studies in this vein include
Bryan S. Turner’s Weber and Islam (1974) which,
arguing for the convergence of Marx’s and
Weber’s views on Asiatic society, sees secularization to the extent that it has occurred in Islamic
societies as essentially mimetic of Western
capitalist secularization. Perry Anderson has
an illuminating section on the political development of Islam in his Lineages of the Absolutist
State (1974). Rodinson’s materialist principles
of explanation are carried into his biography
Muhammad (1980). Attempting to give an
impartial and humanistic account of the life of
the Prophet, Rodinson examines Islam as an
ideological movement. While he accepts that
the Islamic community has possessed a distinct

Islamic studies

364
rereading of the Qur’an and Hadith in the light
of their fundamental intentions, rather than
elevating to an unauthentic authority particular
statements abstracted from their historical and
cultural contexts. Iqbal had already rejected the
trite oppositions, such as that between religion
and science, which had pervaded so much of
nineteenth-century Western as well as Islamic
debate. The language of literary and Cultural
theory, also spurning such oppositions, has
begun to permeate recent discussions of Islam.
Akbar S. Ahmed’s Postmodernism and Islam
(1992) explores the connections between Western
modernism, Postmodernism, and Islam, stressing especially the role of the media – and of
some Muslim extremists – in offering distorted
and essentialist images of Islam. Ahmed offers
a fascinating overview of current ideological
conflicts underpinning the study of Islam (Ahmed,
1992, pp. 154 –91).
In fact, the history of image construction of
Islam has furnished the subject matter for recent
critiques of the Orientalist tradition. The bestknown work in this mode is Edward W. Said’s
Orientalism (1978) which attempts to expose the
categories and methods of Orientalist scholarship
as not only lacking the impartiality they claim, but
also as being part of a broader Western project
to define and effectively construct the “Orient”
for its own political, economic, and ideological
purposes. Said carries this venture into the contemporary political scene in his Covering Islam
(1981).
Aziz Al-Azmeh’s more recent Islams and
Modernities (1993) might be called deconstructive:
it rejects “Islam” as a unifying category of historical
or cultural explanation. Such a category is based
on an essentialist Discourse of identity and
irreducible difference which has both led to the
study of Islam through transcendental essences
such as “Shi‘ism” and generated notions of
changeless Oriental properties. Culturally specific
differences have thereby been reduced to binary
structures, assigning the Islamic world qualities
such as irrationality, servitude, and stagnation,
which are opposed to the inclusive European
categories generated by the Enlightenment:
reason, freedom, and perfectibility (Al-Azmeh,
1993, pp. 18–24). Moreover, such Positivism
and Essentialism have infected the very heart of
Islamic studies: philology. These strategies have

been instrumental in constructing images of
Islam, ranging historically from those of heresy
and the Anti-Christ to more modern portrayals
of Islam as anachronistic. They have also fostered
a genetic and enumerative scholarship, obsessed
with the explanatory power of origins and proceeding merely by the addition of further detail.
Al-Azmeh argues that Islam as a category of
Orientalist discourse must be dissolved and the
notion of objectivity reexamined in the light of
modern theoretical techniques (Al-Azmeh, 1993,
pp. 141–3). Islamists, stresses Al-Azmeh, have
been equally guilty of promoting an essentialist
discourse: they overlook the fact that Islamic
law has never been a rigid code, that it is not
grounded in the actual experience of Muslims, and
that it has historically enjoyed a wide latitude, being
shaped in consonance with the requirements of
Islamic ideology (Al-Azmeh, 1993, pp. 8–12).
The flexibility of Islamic law has lain at the
heart of one of the most stubbornly controversial
issues concerning Islam, the status of women.
Many commentators have held that Islam vastly
improved the conditions of women in medieval
Arabia, restricting polygamy, abolishing female
infanticide, granting women free will in marriage
and the ability to initiate divorce, giving them
rights of property and inheritance (though not
equal to those of men), and even permitting
women to assume political government. This
argument rests on the view that in pre-Islamic
Arabia women had virtually no rights and were
treated as chattels, comprising part of the estates
of their husbands and fathers. Even Islam’s allowing men to take four wives has been justified
by the fact that polygamy was to some extent a
solution to the number of excess women who
were in need of support. Modern scholars tend
to view the nature of the changes between
pre-Islamic and Islamic eras as somewhat more
complex, claiming, for example, that before Islam,
women performed certain crucial functions as
priestesses, prophets, and warriors and that
Islam narrowed this range of roles.
Certainly, some of the important early women
of Islam played a vital part in the growth of the
religion. The Prophet’s first wife Khadija, a prominent businesswoman, was the first convert
to Islam and undoubtedly her social status
aided Muhammad in that initial decisive period.
Muhammad’s final and youngest wife ‘Aisha,

365
Male Elite (1991) and Leila Ahmed’s Women
and Gender in Islam (1992). Situating Islam’s
prescriptions concerning women in a historical
context, Mernissi’s stimulating book argues that
the spirit of Islam’s intentions was to procure
equality for women. Ahmed’s treatment of the subject, to which part of the foregoing account is
indebted, is also historical. She traces the varying
status of women from pre-Islamic times in the
Middle East through the Gender configurations
of successive periods of Islam to the present.
At the core of her argument is that while Islam
secluded women from a range of activities, it has
embraced a tension between its “stubbornly
egalitarian” ethical vision and the hierarchical
structures of marriage pragmatically instituted
in Islamic societies. She points out that the
Qur’an is remarkable among religious texts in
that it is addressed to women as well as men, and
traces in detail the developments outlined above,
such as the crucial role of women in constructing the verbal texts of Islam and the growth of
feminism in the Arab world. She also argues
insightfully against a Western-style feminism
which uncritically inscribes itself into the old
imperialist narratives: Western women assume
that they can pursue feminist goals by redefining
their cultural heritage, but Muslim women, it
is implied, can seek such goals only by rejecting
their own culture for Western ideals. She also
observes the historical linkage of feminism and
imperialism: in the late nineteenth century some
male imperialists, such as Lord Cromer, the
British Consul General in Egypt, led the attack
abroad against Muslim “degradation” of women
while being staunchly resistant to feminism at
home. Equally, however, Ahmed criticizes the
stagnant assumption of Islamists that the meaning of gender in the initiatory Islamic society
was somehow unambiguous; this meaning,
states Ahmed, was contested from the beginning.
What we need, she asserts, is a feminism which
is informed and vigilantly self-aware. Ahmed’s
arguments call for a sensitivity to the cultural construction of values and images, for example,
the veil, a symbol in the West for down-right
oppression in Islam, has a very different range
of significance – including that of resistance to
oppression – in the Arab World.
In general, the excellent work of Mernissi,
Ahmed, Said, Al-Azmeh, and others serves as a

who survived him by many years, was acknowledged as a source of authority regarding the
authenticity of the Hadith and was regularly
consulted on matters of religious law and custom.
She played a decisive part in the first civil war in
Islam over the succession to the Caliphate (the
official governership of Islam), which generated
the schism between Sunni Muslims (followers of
the Sunnah or “way” of the Prophet) and Shi‘ahs
or Shi‘ites (“followers” of ‘Ali, the first cousin of
Muhammad, whose succession they advocated).
Other notable women in Islam have included
the Sufi mystic Rabi‘a al-‘Adawiyya (d. 801) of
Basra, and the distinguished scholars Umm Hani
(d. 1466) and Hajar (b. 1388). The male mystical
philosopher Ibn al-Arabi (1165–1240) stressed
the complementary nature of the sexes as well
as the feminine dimension of the Divine.
In modern times, especially from the late
nineteenth century onwards, some male modernists such as Muhammad ‘Abduh included among
their modernizing proposals calls for the reform
of women’s education and laws concerning
marriage and divorce. A feminist landmark in Arab
society was Qassim Amin’s Tahrir al-Mar’a (The
Liberation of Woman) (1899) which generated
heated dispute. Feminists of the early twentieth
century included Huda Sha‘rawi, a founder of the
Intellectual Association of Egyptian Women (1914),
who espoused a Westernized feminism, and Malak
Hifni Nassef whose feminism shunned “Western”
imperatives such as unveiling. Prominent women
writers in the Islamic world have included the
Indian-born novelist Qurratulain Haider; the
Iranian poet Forugh Farrokhzad (1935–67); and
Iraqi-born Nazik Al-Mala’ika (b. 1923), a seminal
figure in modern Arab poetry. More recently,
the novelist Nawal El-Saadawi has attempted to
expose the psychological and physical abuse of
women; the Pakistani poets Fahmida Riaz and
Kishwar Naheed have explored sensual themes and
the psychology of male–female relationships; the
Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen is currently
facing fierce public and governmental antagonism for her outspoken feminism and atheism.
Writers such as Rana Kabbani have pleaded,
on the basis of their experience of Western and
Islamic cultures, for a dialog between the values
enshrined in each.
Prominent among recent feminist studies of
Islam are Fatima Mernissi’s The Veil and the

still have much to cover in the vast field of
“Islam.” It remains a sad fact that, with the
arguable exception of Muhammad Iqbal, the
Islamic world has not produced a major modern
philosopher.

`Jakobson, Roman (1896–1982) 
Russian
structural linguist and, from 1926, a member of
the Prague linguistic circle. He began his
career as president of the Moscow Linguistic
Circle, and so was at the heart of Russian
Formalism. He and his colleagues were interested
in the relative autonomy of literary works, especially in terms of exactly what it is that distinguishes
them from nonliterary language. His own concern
was with the internal relations which he saw as
the main feature of literature, such as elements
of linguistic patterning and phonological correspondence. A major figure in the development
of Structuralism, Jakobson links Russian formalism with later developments in structuralism
as a whole. He integrated Russian formalist
thought with an overall framework derived from
the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure. He is
therefore linked with the emergence of Semiotics,
and was instrumental in the production of theories of Defamiliarization and Metaphor
and metonymy. His interest in Saussure was,
however, not one of simple acceptance. His relationship with Saussurean linguistics was one
of dialog; he tended to take what he could use
without simply reproducing Saussure’s theory.
In this respect he developed structural linguistics
out of a meeting of formalism and structuralism. Jakobson found Saussure’s antinomies to be
too inflexible for his own needs, especially
with regard to the study of parole (see Langue/
parole), which Saussure had shunned. This

gave Jakobson a way to deal with linguistic
change, something which was not possible for
Saussure.
From his work on the integration of the
two movements, Jakobson elaborated a theory
which claimed that meaning and form are in
fact inseparable, so that, for semantic analysis,
grammatical forms are fundamentally bound up
with their meanings. He therefore replicated in
his theories some of the crucial concepts which
have come to be associated with structuralism,
especially the importance accorded to Binary
oppositions. In this context, for Jakobson, all
forms of communication were constituted by
the interplay between six fundamental elements,
each of which correlates to a general typology:
addressor (emotive); addressee (conative); a
message passed (poetic); the mutual code which
renders intelligibility possible (meta-linguistic);
the means of communication (Phatic); and
a situation to which the message relates (contextual reference). Any element may predominate,
so that, for example, in the case of Poetry,
the message itself is the focus of attention.
Accordingly, Jakobson considered poetics to be
an element of linguistics, a type of relatively
self-conscious linguistic practice. Poetry draws
attention to itself in addition to its communicative function. In attempting to apply structural
linguistics to poetic analysis, Jakobson produced
several readings which are considered to be classic examples of structuralist literary criticism.

Jakobson, Roman

James, C.L.R.

368
In his criticism Jakobson attempted to show that
structuralist techniques can reveal the patterns
which structure any given Text. An objective
critical science was therefore a possibility (but see
also Binary opposition and Structuralism
for further discussion of this kind of structuralist claim). Jakobson put his theory into practice
by dividing the poems he read into groups of
stanzas. These groups were organized around
binary oppositions such as outer/inner. He then
paid very close attention to elements of symmetry between the groups, for example, the uses
of pronominal forms or patterns of adjectival
variants. He also paid a great deal of attention to
phonological patternings and correspondences,
something which was always one of his main
interests. His theoretical position in respect to this
area was that sounds are structured by a System
of relations by difference, just as language is. The
sound system of a poem is part of the functional
system which comprises the poem as a whole:
the term he used for the basic element of this
system was the “phoneme.” As with the linguistic Sign, the phoneme exists in relation to other
phonemes in the system of which they are a part,
and he made great efforts to identify the various
correspondences which made up the system. He
applied this research to the problem of sound
change in language development as well as to his
readings of poetic texts.
In effect, Jakobson’s analytical method was
to enumerate instances of symmetry, producing
lists of syntactically similar features which structure the poem as a whole. A problem with this
approach, of course, is that it privileges simple
numerical preponderance. Another and much
more crucial problem is that it assumes that a
repetition of internal elements is all that matters
in the exposition of a text. The possibility of an
almost endless reading of patterns would imply
that the scientific method which Jakobson sought
to achieve may not be possible. Thus his claim
that his method simply and objectively found
in the text patterns (and hence meanings) which
were already there precludes the observation that
such a reading can always find what it is looking
for. The reading can in fact be seen to produce
the patterns, so that the relationship of the
reader to the text is much more problematical than
Jakobson assumed (see also Structuralism for
more discussion of this topic).

To some extent Jakobson anticipated these
difficulties. He tried to explain the functions
performed by each of the patterns which he
discerned, especially in the case of the relation between phonological correspondences and
semantic ones, so that the two became of equivalent relevance in the reading process. He made
reference to a relationship between these correspondences and the reader’s own experience.
The act of reading a poem was supposed to
awaken the reader’s experience, and so the
patterns which exist in poetry are somehow
equivalent to the reader’s perceptions. In fact,
these immanent structures do not have to be
perceived by the conscious reading mind: in this
theory syntactic patterns will always echo
thought patterns, even if the reader is not fully
aware of them. Jakobson therefore assumed that
his structural linguistics was objectively correct.

`James, C.L.R. (1901–89) 
Caribbean man of
letters. Cyril Lionel Robert James was born in
Trinidad, January 4, 1901, one year after the
historic Pan-African Congress in London – an
organization in which he would play an active
part subsequently. James, along with the other
great Pan-Africanist from Trinidad, George
Padmore, formed the International Friends of
Ethiopia, in response to Mussolini’s invasion
of Ethiopia in 1935. James edited the monthly
journal International African Opinion. In the
emerging struggle for decolonization in various
parts of the African diaspora, it was James who
in A History of Negro Revolt, drew attention to the
historical antecedents of the political struggles
of the time.
Known simply by his initials, and to his close
associates as “Nello,” he became one of the
Caribbean’s great men of letters. A philosopher,
James was an astute Marxist and Hegelian
dialectician. He was also a social and cultural
critic, sports writer, novelist, playwright, political
activist, and labor organizer.

369
At the heart of C.L.R. James’s world view was
a notion contained in a letter to Constance
Webb, written in 1944, “to develop the consciousness, the independence, the sense of destiny,
the sense of responsibility, among the masses of
people.” James valued this ideal very dearly. His
was a life of intellectual rigor and popular practice
and engagement. James was as comfortable being
a colleague of Jomo Kenyatta, a mentor to the
former Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago,
Eric Williams, or advisor to Kwame Nkrumah, as
he was organizing workers, or politically mobilizing them into his Workers and Farmers Party in
Trinidad in 1966. His interests were wide and
divergent, some may even say contradictory. It was
this intellectual perspicacity and fecundity which
drove him to write about the social, cultural, and
historical forces at work in the game of cricket
in his now famous Beyond a Boundary (1963),
and it was his deep love and interest in literature
which resulted in his examination of Herman
Melville as a critic of bureaucratic capitalism and
authoritarianism in his Mariners, Renegades and
Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the
World We Live In (1953).
If Notes On Dialectics: Hegel, Marx, Lenin
(1948) signaled the evolution of James’s political
thinking, then his Party Politics in the West Indies
(1962) articulated his attempt to interpret and
apply Marxism creatively to the specific cultural milieu. Controversies over the privileging
of his cultural work over his political work (see
Cudjoe, 1992), or the neglect of his writing on
the Hispanic Caribbean (see López Springfield,
1992), or his admiration of European intellectual
traditions over other types of tradition, or how
his emphasis on class analysis at times marginalized importantant considerations of race (see
Martin, 1972, and Worcester, 1992), are testimony
to the remarkably complex legacy that James
has left the world. C.L.R. James died in London
in 1989 and was buried in Trinidad in May of the
same year. Since his death, his intellectual contribution has become even more celebrated in the
recent publication of several journal articles, two
biographies, two major collections of his work, and
three anthologies dedicated to various dimensions of the Jamesian oeuvre. These publications,
along with those still in press, in addition to
his own published work, will secure James’s
intellectual contribution for posterity.

James, C.L.R.

James published La Divina Pastora in 1927.
This was one of his earlier pieces of fiction. He
also published Triumph (1929) in the literary
journal Trinidad. During this period James also
completed his only full-length work of fiction,
Minty Alley, which was published in England
in 1936. C.L.R. James left the Caribbean in 1932
for the United Kingdom. He had taken with
him a completed manuscript – a biography of the
Trinidadian trade union leader Captain Cipriani.
The Life of Captain Cipriani: An Account of
British Government in the West Indies was published in 1932. Immediately upon his arrival
in England, he became politically active, joining
the British Labour Party but finding himself
“to the left of the Labour party.” His leftist
militancy led him to join the Trotskyists in
London. Interviewed in 1987 James noted, “I
came to London and in a few months I was a
Trotskyist.”
From England C.L.R. James moved to the
United States in 1938, where he remained until
1952, when he was deported in the throes of
the McCarthyite communist witch hunts. As
with his arrival in England, James wasted no
time in establishing contact with the Trotskyists
in the United States. He became a member of the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP). James initially
broke with the Trotskyists in 1940 on ideological
and tactical grounds. He was highly critical of
the SWP’s defense of Soviet orthodoxy. James,
who used the pseudonym “J.R. Johnson,” and Raya
Dunayevskaya (a close comrade of James) whose
pseudonym was “Feddie Forest,” were the main
critics of this orthodoxy within the SWP. This
faction became known as the Johnson–Forest
Tendency and later rejoined the Trotskyists, only
to leave again in 1950.
Along with his political activity during this
period James’s intellectual contribution was
marked by the publication of his seminal work on
the overthrow of slavery and the establishment
of the first black independent nation in the
western hemisphere. This account of the Haitian
Revolution of 1791–1803 was published in 1938
as Black Jacobins: Toussaint L’Ouverture and the
San Domingo Revolution, and has become a
classic. James also published in 1937 World
Revolution 1917–1936: The Rise and Fall of the
Communist International, and coauthored State
Capitalism and World Revolution (1950).

`Japanese studies 
A functional definition of
Japanese studies is the academic investigation of
those myriad institutions comprising the culture
of Japan over time. It should be clear in a work
dedicated to the multiplicity that is cultural and
critical theory, however, that there can never be
just a single entity, a single conception, or a single
form that can legitimately be called Japanese
studies. Indeed, the homogenizing effect of suggesting that a representative definition exists of
necessity generalizes the (polyvalent) specific to
an extent that jeopardizes the value and validity
of the assumption (although this sort of hegemonic
simplification is a integral part of a least one
domestic strain of the field): Japanese studies is
dynamic. Indeed, there is an inescapable immediacy of its (re)construction by the hegemonic
voices of the critical corpus, of which this entry
is a guilty and unreliable participant. Yet we
must recognize the constraints in this degree of
critical acuity, and agree to accept the limitations
inherent in the distancing that obtains from
generalization. What follows is, thus, a selective
overview that attempts to chart a course between
Japanese studies as a diachronic and synchronic
entity, and, simultaneously, as a geographically
variegated entity. While recognizing that the
diversity of cultures within which the study of
Japan is prosecuted gives rise to myriad iterations

of Japanese studies that are inherently different,
we might simultaneously agree that there are
two major realms within which such study takes
place: domestically within Japan and internationally. One keystone component of Japanese
studies in either case is the necessary and
unstable role of the Other against which Japan
is measured. This Saussurean reliance on what
a thing is not has done much to influence the
course of the development of the field.
It was the European religious and commercial
imperialist movement that set the stage for what
would eventually become Japanese Studies. The
arrival during the sixteenth century of Jesuit
missionaries in Japan such as Francis Xavier,
who first breached the shores to proselytize; Luís
Fróis, who spent over six decades in Japan and
chronicled in detail the turbulent period at the
dawn of Japan’s appearance as a nation state;
and João Rodrigues, whose efforts in the field of
linguistics remain relevant to this day, might
be a reasonable moment from which to date
the inception of Japanese studies in the West,
although the precise term was not, of course,
used. There was a practical desire to learn about
the country, its people, and its customs, yet the
motivation stemmed less from an appreciation
of the intrinsic value of these things than from a
practical need of the colonizer to understand the
lands he wished to collect. The Jesuit Alessandro
Valignano’s efforts to integrate an awareness of
the culture into missionary life, for example,
were not so much motivated by a desire to
understand per se, as they were a practical way
to better facilitate conversion of the populace.
As self-serving as these aggregate efforts might
have been, they also formed the foundation
upon which future generations would build their
views of Japan and the Japanese. More importantly,
perhaps, they gave concrete evidence for why
the country should be studied, for out of the
practical grew the theoretical.
To the efforts of these religious imperialists
we must next add those of members in the commercial sector, which, although constrained by
Japanese law from the mid-seventeenth century
to the small island of Dejima off the southwestern city of Nagasaki, evinced the same
interest in the country for a practical gain. Yet
with these commercial enterprises there also
came Europeans with interests going beyond the

371
numerous luminaries in the field have been
active in the Society: Lafcadio Hearn, James C.
Hepburn, and George B. Sansom to name but
three of the best known. Without diminishing the
genuine contributions to the field the work of these
men eventually inspired, it is not unreasonable
to conceptualize their studies as motivated primarily by the exoticness of the oriental Other.
The Second World War was the next great
impetus for dedicated study of Japan, although
that interest once again centered on a functional
understanding of the Other devoted to the goal
of victory over the enemy. It is with the group of
scholars who emerged from that conflict, often
after serving in roles focused on language, that
what we call Japanese studies today emerged in
the United States. The field has moved, over the
course of the past half century, from a discipline
characterized by the Orientalism described by
Edward Said and focused predominantly on the
language and culture of the Other, to a vibrant
field in the early twenty-first century informed
by scholars employing a wide range of critical
tools, from Deconstruction to feminist theory,
Psychoanalysis to Postcolonialism. Harumi
Befu, Nina Cornyetz, Kevin Doak, Harry
Harootunian, Tessa Morris-Suzuki, Naoki Sakai,
Atsuko Sakaki, Dennis Washburn, Tomoko
Yoda, and others all bring to their varied studies
in anthropology, history, and literature critical
apparatus that permits them to go beyond the
explication of the exotic Other that characterized
the work of their predecessors and focus instead
upon the more fundamental questions of what
the Japanese are and why they are that way, very
broadly defined, as well as the meta-questions of
what the field itself is, was, and should be.
Most major research institutions and many
smaller colleges in the United States offer some
program in Japanese studies, an indication of the
importance given to this branch of area studies
as well as a recognition of the degree to which
Japan has permeated, at all levels, US culture(s).
Japanese studies domestically is no less varied
than are its international counterparts. Based on
a strong tradition of what might be termed selfreflections, this inward focus of Japanese studies
at home is, simultaneously, firmly dependent
upon an assumed Other that functions as the
necessary legitimizing touchstone for those
investigations. The late twentieth century saw,

Japanese studies

purely economic, branching out into history,
literature, and science. Men such as Englebert
Kaempfer, whose highly influential history of
Japan was published posthumously in the early
eighteenth century; Carl Peter Thunberg, a
Swedish physician whose work in the botany of
Japan insured his fame in Europe; the physician
Philipp Franz von Siebold, who provided descriptions of the flora and fauna of Japan in the
nineteenth century, as well as an extensive
collection of natural and cultural artifacts he
brought back to Belgium (and, subsequently,
Holland); and Isaac Titsingh, a high-ranking
member of the Dutch East India Company
stationed at Dejima, who provided detailed
descriptions of cultural ceremonies such as marriages and funerals, and treatises on sake and
soy sauce production. These men provided both
a window into the world of the then-mysterious
orient and a tantalizing and enduring image of
the difference that was to be found there. In
aggregate, then, these early participants in the
European imperialist impulse at the time were
the pioneer Japanoligists: experts by virtue of
their knowledge gained through residence and
research in Japan. Their work focused on the
practical and the scientific, although punctuated
by idiosyncratic explorations in disparate areas
that strayed into the literary and the artistic.
The next major wave of interpretation came
with Japan’s move in the latter half of the
nineteenth century to import myriad aspects of
Western know-how. Europeans and Americans
were brought to Japan in various capacities and
many, in turn, proved themselves to be excellent
conduits of information for their countrymen.
Former members of the various diplomatic
corps that were established in the newly opened
nation, too, parlayed their experiences into
positions as interpreters of the country. From
these varied ranks come such men as William
G. Aston, Basil Hall Chamberlain, Frederick
V. Dickins, Ernest Fenollosa, Johannes J. Rein,
Léon de Rosny, and Ernest Satow, all of whom
expanded the range and focus of the nascent
area of scholarship. This efflorescence of interest led to the creation, in 1872, of the Asiatic
Society of Japan in Yokohama. It was a place
to exchange information about the country, a
role that marks it as perhaps the birthplace of
Western Japanese studies. Over the years,

Japanese studies

372
across disciplines, a vital engagement with
Western critical theories, supported and encouraged, in part, by a robust translation industry
intent upon making accessible knowledge about
the Other. One of the most prominent and
influential interpreters of things Japanese is
Karatani Kdjin, a cultural philosopher whose
wide-ranging scholarship exhibits a significant
engagement with the theoretical works of Paul De
Man and Jacques Derrida, for example. Asada
Akira, Komori Ydichi, and Yoshimoto Takaaki are
other scholars whose work engages and extends
Western critical models.
Within this expected distribution of foci and
theoretical orientations, however, there is a particular line of nationalistic scholarly effort that
deserves special attention, for it has been marked
by a predisposition for explaining the past in a
way that guides or forms the present understanding of who the Japanese are and why they
are different from the (usually Western) Other.
The invention of a past to construct the present
is, of course, neither new nor unique to Japan;
however, there is an almost enthusiastic embrace
of Bourdieu’s “genesis amnesia” that accompanies
the project and obscures its rewritings of the
past. This predilection has been marshaled in the
service of everything from military sacrifice to economic growth (and its accompanying sacrifices)
to sensitivity to art and nature (sacrificing logic),
yet it is nationalism that is the ineluctable force
coursing through the veins of this Japanese
identity discourse. In all cases, the resulting construct called “Japanese” is no more real than a
blueprint is an actual building; yet the force of
these figments is grounded in enough of the
soil of reality that they appeal to a large segment of the population, and have done so over
time. This brand of Japanese studies falls
under the rubric of Nihonjinron (philosophy of
“Japaneseness”).
While much of what passes for scholarship in
this field invites skepticism, if not outright disbelief and condemnation, from Western scholars
as well as some within Japan, it is important to
realize that Nihonjinron shares, in its ethnocentric definitions of the Other, a bias frequently
found in the Orientalist discourse that characterized much of the early study of Japan from without. By seeing it as an understandable reaction to
past excesses, we permit ourselves to recognize

in this discourse privileging Japanese as a unique
people that significant insights into Japan, its
culture, and its people fall under the umbrella
of Nihonjinron. It is also important to recognize
that conclusions of Nihonjinron have a periodicity: although the conclusions of uniqueness
remain constant, the degree to which that
uniqueness is evaluated positively has varied
over time.
One might detect the early seeds of this particular brand of Japanese studies in the work of
nativist scholars such as Kado no Azumamard,
Kamo no Mabuchi, and Motoori Norinaga, perhaps the most influential and well known of
these early Japanese intellectuals concerned with
illuminating the identity of Japan. As the most
prominent proponent of the kokugaku (National
Learning) movement, Norinaga made exhaustive
studies in the eighteenth century of the Japanese
classics (as opposed to works of Chinese origin,
particularly those with a Confucian bent) in pursuit of the nature, or the uniqueness, of Japan, centered not on the rational but on the emotional.
In particular, the idea that nature had within
it the power to evoke, in the mind sensitively
attuned to aesthetics, mono no aware (“the pathos
of things”) was and remains highly influential.
Indeed, while Norinaga’s project, and that of his
disciple, Hirata Atsutane, lacks the requisite
specifics to qualify for this categorization, his
focus on the unique position of the Japanese
as residents of the birthplace of the gods, and
the special qualities with which this distinction
bestowed the Japanese, evinces the single-minded
effort to enlist the past to enable the construction of a present identity (through a recreated
“ancient way”) that remains the linchpin of the
branch of modern Japanese studies known as
Nihonjinron.
Two centuries later, the folklorist Yanagita
Kunio further engaged the question of “Japaneseness” in his search for an authentic Japan,
however vestigial, still present in the rural fringes
of the country. Where his contemporary Nitobe
Inazd was a proponent of the view that Japanese
identity was distinct from, but no less legitimate
than, the rational, individualistic, and scientific
Western character, the Other that haunts the
liminal spaces surrounding this discourse,
Yanagita argued a syncretic view: culture was
dynamic and multifaceted, both temporally and

373
Japanese population, and publications on this
subject have been consistently strong.
Nihonjinron holds that all aspects of Japan
are bound up with being Japanese. Agricultural
development, group orientation privileging
hierarchical relationships, the geographic lottery
that made Japan an island nation, the supposed
impenetrability of the Japanese language, the
geologic consequences of plate tectonics, the
physiology of the Japanese, and the cultural
impact of climate all contribute in some unique
way to constructing and defining the Japanese.
Hence, thinkers in numerous areas are associated
with Nihonjinron. Writers such as Nakane Chie
and Doi Takeo are often credited with laying,
albeit unintentionally, the foundations for later
developments in this area with their works on
sociology and psychology in the late 1960s and
early 1970s. Later that decade, Tamaki Akira
focused on the effects wet rice production has on
the Japanese nature. Tsunoda Takanobu came to
prominence in 1978 with an influential book on
the language processing functions of the Japanese
brain, in which he argued for a fundamental
difference from those processes in its Western
(notably, not Asian) counterpart, a difference
born of learning Japanese as a native language, and
at a young age. In a move against the rational,
dichotomous thinking that supposedly characterizes Western thought, Ishida Eiichird, Masuda
Yoshio, and Okada Susumu argue that the uniqueness of the Japanese people both co tributes to
and stems from the lack of a need for the binary
categories found in the West. Other contributors
of note in the debate are Higuchi Kiyoyuki,
Tamura Keiji, Aoki Tamotsu, and Suzuki Takao.
Finally, the implicit normative force of Nihonjinron should not be underestimated. The exhortation to adhere to the model immanent in the
descriptive power of the arguments may be what
allows so many Japanese to agree with (some of )
the propositions that make up Nihonjinron
despite the daily evidence that the homogeneity
lauded in this discourse is merely a relative
term. There is a significant “feel good” and “do
right” element to acting “Japanese” as defined
by Nihonjinron. The state harnesses the public’s
predisposition to accept the propositions of
culturally appropriate behavior put forth by the
advocates of Nihonjinron in service of a national
moral identity, both at home and abroad. Buy-in

geographically, yet part of a process that fundamentally cohered in a historical flow towards
some idealized, yet ever more difficult to discover and articulate, character. The Japan that
emerged from this dynamic between periphery and
center, and material and spiritual, was a culturally unified entity, yet one that was paradoxically
an impossibility precisely because the center was
urban, modern, and materialistically political;
however, Yanagita believed that by identifying
those elements unique to Japan (relative to the
Other, that is to say, the West), the “true Japan”
could be rediscovered and reanimated in the
present and on the center. An essential component of this uniqueness was that Japan, on the
global stage, occupied this same liminal position
as did the rural in Yanagita’s imaginary locus
of the primeval jDmin (abiding folk) in whom the
forgotten traditions of the past resided, hidden,
yet present.
From the period leading up to the Second
World War through the present, Nihonjinron
has gradually replaced kokugaku and taken on
a life of its own, coming of age, as it were, in
the 1970s in tandem with Japan’s surprisingly
powerful emergence on the world economic
stage as one way to explain that success, and
becoming an influential force in the 1980s.
The term covers a cross-disciplinary discourse –
contributions are found in diverse fields from
ecology to sociology, history to philosophy,
linguistics to psychology – characterized by the
absence of any central, overarching theoretical
concern beyond a cultural particularism used to
explain Japan to the Other, or to recover and
reaffirm a (predominantly fictional) national
identity. Indeed, whatever racial and ethnic
diversity there may be in Japan is conveniently
ignored in the rush to claim a homogeneity
essential to the cultural construction that is
the life blood of Nihonjinron. Moreover, these
inherently ethnocentric comparisons are not
necessarily objective; instead, they seek not only
to show what makes the Japanese unique, but also
to demonstrate that that uniqueness is qualitatively better than the object of comparison. This
formlessness and willful disregard of historical
objectivity aside, the emotional appeal of the
conclusions of Nihonjinron supporting the notion
of a homogeneous, ethnically pure Japan are
embraced in varying degrees by a majority of the

from the public helps to ensure that Nihonjinron
will remain vital, both as a guide for domestic
behavior, and as a way to present an idealized
“face” to the rest of the world.

`Jaspers, Karl (1883–1969) 
Trained as a
doctor and psychiatrist, Jaspers turned to philosophy during the 1914–18 war, publishing in
1919 his Psychology of World Views, which he
later called the first truly existentialist book.
Despite his influence on contemporaries in
Germany and France, the bulk, repetitiveness,
and turgid style of his writings have made
Jaspers unattractive to later generations.
It is two themes from Kant which inspire
Jaspers’s thinking. First, the limits of empirical
and scientific understanding, which render it
incapable of grasping reality as a unitary whole
and of elucidating the nature of the self. Second,
and relatedly, the “ambiguous” or “antinomical”
character of human beings, at once denizens of the
natural world and enjoying Existenz, a spontaneous
freedom and responsibility for determining the
course and significance of their lives.
It is the insistence on Existenz, and the ways
we experience it through the Grenzsituationen
(“boundary situations”) of mortality, guilt, and
sheer contingency, which warrant Jaspers’s classification as an existentialist. But it is misleading
to follow Sartre and label him a “Christian
existentialist.” While Jaspers thought that our
sense of reality’s wholeness and freedom as a

“gift” were “ciphers” pointing to a transcendent
order, the “Encompassing,” he denied that this
order could be explained in familiar religious
terms – or indeed in any terms: “Whatever we
think we know about the deity is superstition.”
Perhaps Jaspers’s most persistent motif is the
“paradox” that human beings must occupy
standpoints, moral ones included, for which no
validation is feasible. Instead of trying to resolve
the “paradox” we must cultivate a “philosophic
faith” which respects the freedom to occupy different standpoints, resists the reduction of men
to items of nature (as Jaspers thought Freud
and Marx were attempting), and encourages an
openness to the intimations of the transcendent.
In his emphases on indeterminacy, eclecticism,
and openness, Jaspers presages some current
“postmodernist” attitudes.

`jokes 
Jokes are, according to Freud’s analysis
(Freud, 1905), characterized by many of the
same features as dreams and the Dream-work,
namely Condensation/displacement. They
afford a release of intellectual tension, while
the uncovering of unconscious material (much
of it sexual) in the conscious system strikes us
as comic. Jokes also allow a recovery of the
infantile pleasure in nonsense and in the almost
physical handling of words. Freud’s study of
jokes is regarded by Lacan (1957) as one of the
Canonical texts on the Unconscious and as
evidence that the unconscious is structured like
a language.

discriminations, while subsumptive judgment
assumes a discrimination between particulars
before it may apply a universal.
Since Kant the issue of judgment has been
uppermost in both the theory and practice of
criticism. Attempts to prefer discriminative
judgment have been met by the criticism that
it covertly assumes a law or principle, while
subsumptive judgments made according to
Canonical criteria are accused of ignoring or
suppressing differences. The recent focus of
Critical theory on the problem of judgment
itself should, however, contribute to sharpening critical sensitivity to the undecidability or
“Aporia” of judgment.

`judgment 
This is a prominent concept in
modern philosophy, which since Descartes has
been concerned with establishing the legitimacy
of theoretical, practical, and aesthetic judgments.
Descartes’s Discourse on Method (1637) is dedicated
to the establishment of “correct judgment,” and
the principle task of Antoine Arnauld’s Cartesian
Logic or the Art of Thinking (Port Royal Logic)
(1662) is that of “training the judgment, making
it as exact as we can.” The Enlightenment concern with the justification of the legitimacy
of judgments is exemplified by Kant’s critical
philosophy. Kant describes all thinking as judgment, and in each of his three critiques attempts
to establish the limits and legitimacy of theoretical, practical, and aesthetic judgments. The
critiques may be read as dissections of the faculty
of judgment in the course of which Kant discovers an irresolvable tension between its two
distinct but related modes. The first mode of
judgment is discriminative, and its exercise consists of the discernment of differences; the second
is subsumptive, and consists of the subsumption
of a particular case under a universal law. Kant
shows that the relationship between the two
modes of judgment is undecidable: discriminative
judgment assumes a law by which to make its

`Jung, Carl Gustav (1875–1961) 
Swiss psychiatrist, depth psychologist, founder of the school
of thought termed “analytical psychology.” It
was in 1907 that Jung and Sigmund Freud first
met in Vienna, and Jung became interested in
Freud’s work in Psychoanalysis. By 1909,
however, the two men had experienced a rupture
after an extended residence together at Clark
University in Massachusetts, and by 1913 they
had broken definitively following the publication of Jung’s Transformation and Symbols of the
Libido (renamed Symbols of Transformation).
There were three fundamental reasons for the
split. First, Jung was unable to accept Freud’s concept of libido as being limited to sexual energy,
believing instead in an energizing theory based
on a principle of opposites (1969a, pp. 18ff.). Jung
conceived of the psyche as a dynamic, selfregulating system whose energy (or libido)
grows out of a tension that flows between two
opposing poles; to discover what something
means, one must constantly attend to its obverse
or opposite. The second major point of contention between Freud and Jung concerned the way
the Unconscious content was to be interpreted
symbolically, whether as the sole reflection of
a personal conflict, or as the manifestation of a
collective aspect of the individual psyche whose

`jouissance 
A French word with a range of
senses of “enjoyment,” including that of sexual
orgasm. It was given critical currency by Roland
Barthes whose Le Plaisir du Texte distinguished
between textual pleasure ( plaisir) and textual
jouissance. The former means comfort in reading,
delight in a mastery of given forms; the latter is
unsettling, an abrupt loss of subject identity
and cultural grounds. The distinction draws on
the psychoanalytic work of Jacques Lacan, for
whom jouissance names the experience of a tension beyond any satisfaction in pleasure and
which bears on the very limits of subjectivity, on
the radical effects of the human Subject’s constitutive division in language.

contents are repeated through myriad universal
myths. Freud could not formally embrace this view,
mostly because he saw in it an implicit admission
of inherited racial experiences. Jung, however,
did not mean to imply that experience as such is
inherited. Rather, he fathomed a deeper structure
of the unconscious than the personal unconscious, the dwelling place of instinctive impulses
to actions shaped and influenced by the experiences of (wo)mankind, but which can become
manifest only through individual experience
and so appear as individual acquisitions. Finally,
disagreements that occurred during the mutual
analysis of dreams brought an end to the relationship between Freud and Jung.
Jung made the unconscious comprehensible
in terms of the spiritual quest of (wo)mankind;
for him its “depths” are not always dark and
negative as they are to Freud. Although the
unconscious extends into the lower layers of
one’s animal nature, Jung believes that it also
reaches up, out, and beyond to a higher dimension of being. It is not merely the repository of
everything objectionable, infantile – even animal
– in ourselves, but the ever-creative principle in
a person’s life (1970, p. 15). Jung initially wanted
to call his own school of thought “complex
psychology” before he named it “analytical psychology,” demonstrating the importance he
attributed to this aspect of the psyche. He defined
complexes as “psychic entities which are outside
the control of the conscious mind. They have split
from consciousness and lead a separate existence
in the dark realm of the unconscious, being at
all times ready to hinder or reinforce conscious
functioning” (1953; italics mine). Complexes,
then, are two-faced: they can produce totally
opposite effects, be evil or good, destructive or constructive. The aspect they show depends largely
on the conscious attitude and how they affect a
person’s capacity for understanding and moral
evaluation.
Jung uses the term individuation to refer to
the gradual, lifelong process of balancing and
harmonizing the individual psyche so that consciousness and the unconscious ultimately come
to complement and compensate one another.
The vehicle of individuation can be a dream
or any fantasized image which the individual is
asked to describe or elaborate in any number of
ways, “dramatic, dialectic, visual, acoustic, or

in the form of dancing, painting, drawing, or
modelling” (1969a, p. 202). Individuation, which
develops most noticeably in the second half of
life, can also been construed as a quest of “selfrealization,” an archetypal (collective) psychic
process that enables the individual to experience
his or her spiritual life; as such it is a key to
the interpretation of world religions, myths,
and philosophies. Jung sees a similarity between
the inner transformations in individuation and
religious conversion.
Individuation is sometimes described as a
psychological journey toward self-discovery that
cannot occur without suffering. It can at times
seem to take a circuitous path and lead in circles
or, more accurately, in spirals. The process
begins with a wounding of the conscious personality, when a person first has an inkling
that there exists a shadow complex, or the dark,
negative, and inferior side of the personality,
the sum of all those unpleasant qualities usually
hidden and the “other side” of behaviors that have
been cultivated within consciousness (1969b,
part II, pp. 8–9). One must learn to live with this
often terrifying aspect of oneself, for there is
no psychic wholeness without a recognition and
assimilation of opposites. The confrontation
with the shadow perforce entails a dissolution of
the persona or the conscious ideal of the personality, the mask worn in one’s daily intercourse
in society. The “journeyer” will also meet with
the Archetypes of the unconscious and face the
danger of succumbing to the peculiar fascination
of these primordial factors, “uniform and regularly recurring modes of apprehension” (1969a,
p. 137). In particular, he or she will encounter,
respectively, the anima or animus archetype, the
complementary feminine element contained in
the unconscious of a man or the masculine element found in the unconscious of a woman.
These principles of “femaleness” and “maleness”
are not to be confused with Femininity or
Masculinity inherently characterizing women
or men, but should be construed instead as
Symbolic images associated, for example, with the
ancient Chinese concepts of yin and yang or with
the modern Jungian constructs of eros and logos.
Eros, for Jung, is associated with the connective
quality of relationship, while Logos goes with
that of discrimination and cognition (1969b,
part II, p. 14).

wholeness capture the essence of “selfhood.”
During crucial stages of the individuation, Jung
observes, there is often an important association between an inner thought, vision, dream, or
premonition and an outer event that may pass
unnoticed because, “considering the psychic
relativity of space and time, such a connection is
not even conceivable” (1969a, p. 526). More to
the point, the individual has not yet learned
to be aware of the uncanny type of meaningful
coincidence and to make the necessary connections. The term synchronicity is used to
describe the existence of a significant relationship between inner and outer events that are not
themselves causally linked, but whose apprehension, in the final analysis, enables a woman
or man to be most fully interrelated and interconnected as a human being and to experience
the mysterious ecstasy of selfhood in its most
transcendent form.

Jung, Carl Gustav

After the anima and animus, the two archetypes that are likely to exert influence on a man’s
or woman’s life are the old wise man and the great
mother. These can appear in various other forms
– in a man, for instance, as a king or hero,
medicine man or savior, trickster or mighty
man (for example, magician or devil); and in
a woman as an earth mother or a primordial
mother (for example, witch). When these
archetypes are awakened, a man or a woman
may come to believe that he or she really possesses
the mana, or the seemingly magical power and
wisdom they hold. Jung terms possession by
these archetypes inflation, which “involves an
extension of the personality beyond individual
limits, in other words, a state of being puffed
up” (1953, p. 143). Nevertheless, the feeling of
omnipotence that comes through inflation is an
illusion and can compel a person to overestimate
his or her strength and capacity. One does not
really possess the supposed wisdom of a superhuman god or spirit or demon (in the case of
a man) or of an overprotective or tyrannical
mother figure (in the case of a woman); both
manifestations are in fact voices from the
unconscious that need to be consciously apprehended and understood for their true value to
become accessible. Because of the danger of possession and of inflation, Jung says that one of the
fundamental aims of individuation is “to divest
the self . . . of the suggestive power of primordial
images” (1953, p. 174).
Ideally, in the end, if they are fortunate, a man
or woman will succeed in reconciling opposing
elements in their beings, and such integration
can be formulated as the finding of the “God
within,” or as the apprehension of the archetype
of wholeness, the self (1953, p. 238). Phrases
such as totality, the center of personality, and

K

`Kant, Immanuel (1724–1804) 
German
Enlightenment philosopher. Kant spent his
entire life in the East Prussian city of Königsberg
(now Kaliningrad), where he studied and taught
philosophy at the university. In spite of this
unpromising provincial background, he produced
a body of philosophical writings which have had
an incalculable influence upon modern philosophy and Critical theory. His work is conventionally divided into “precritical” and “critical”
periods. In the writings of the first period
between 1747 and 1780, including Observations
on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime (1764)
and On the Form and Principles of the Sensible
and Intelligible World (1770), Kant developed an
essayistic and unsystematic critique of the rationalism of the early German Enlightenment. In
the second, “critical” period Kant systematized this
critique in the critical trilogy Critique of Pure
Reason (1781, second edition 1787), Critique of
Practical Reason (1788), and Critique of Judgement (1790) on which his reputation now rests.
In the “critical philosophy” Kant attempted
to establish the sources and limits of legitimate
theoretical, practical, and aesthetic Judgments. In
doing so he criticized existing claims to legitimate
judgments, describing his work as a contribution
to “the age of criticism.” For him nothing was
exempt from criticism or “the test of free and open
examination”; neither religion nor the state
“may exempt themselves from it,” and especially
not the intellectual disciplines and institutions

supported by, and supportive of, these institutions.
His procedure of rigorously scrutinizing critical
judgments for their presuppositions and exclusions
still implicitly governs the enterprise of “criticism”
and “critical theory.”
In the first critique, Critique of Pure Reason,
Kant critically examines the claims to theoretical
knowledge made by the “pure reason” of metaphysics. The first part of the book, on “transcendental aesthetic” and “transcendental analytic,” was
envisaged by Kant as the critical replacement
for traditional ontology, and determines the
limits of legitimate judgments about the world
of objects. Legitimate knowledge is restricted to
appearances in space and time which are organized
according to the framework of the 12 categories
of the understanding. Kant regarded any attempt
to extend judgments beyond these limits to
objects such as God, the Subject, and the world
as leading inevitably to the illusions unmasked in
the second section of the critique on the “Transcendental Dialectic.” In this part of the critique,
Kant shows in detail how the attempts to make
judgments concerning the “unitary subject” yield
to the illusory inferences or “paralogisms” of
psychology, those concerning the “world” to the
consistent but contradictory conclusions of the
“antinomies” of cosmology, and those of God to
the impossible and specious proofs of theology.
The first critique illustrates the constructive
and destructive aspects of the critical philosophy:
by first establishing the limits of legitimate

`Kermode, Frank (1919–) 
British literary
critic. Frank Kermode is one of the most versatile literary critics of this century. His early work
(1947–67) included influential critical essays and
books on Shakespeare, Spenser, Donne, Milton,
and Marvell, as well as on a wide range of
modern writers, including W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot,
Wallace Stevens, and (later) D.H. Lawrence. A
continuing concern in this work was an effort to
determine the constituent features of classicism,
Romanticism, and modernism. In retrospect,
such publications as his introduction to the
Arden edition of Shakespeare’s The Tempest
(1954) and The Romantic Image (1957) can be read
as subtly theoretical texts. With the publication
of the highly influential The Sense of an Ending
(1967), however, Kermode’s writing became
more explicitly theoretical, although his work as
a critic and reviewer has continued unabated.
During his tenure as Lord Northcliffe Professor
at University College London, Kermode organized
a series of seminars on literary theory, which
introduced many important European theorists
to Britain and – along with the Modern Masters
series that he edited for Fontana – influenced a
generation of scholars, students, and general
readers. A rare glimpse of Kermode’s teaching
activities is also available in English Renaissance
Literature: Introductory Lectures (1974). His
innovative critical scholarship and teaching
continued when he assumed the position of
King Edward VII Professor at Cambridge, a post
he resigned after a much publicized incident
concerning a junior colleague whose tenure
decision was publicly associated (perhaps mistakenly) with a referendum on poststructuralism
(see Kermode, 1990b, p. 80).
The implicitly biblical interests of The Sense
of an Ending became more overt in Kermode’s
The Genesis of Secrecy (1979) and in his contributions to The Literary Guide to the Bible (1987).
In these books Kermode addressed such perennial questions as the limits of interpretation,
the determination of the Canon (sacred and

knowledge, it is then possible to detect and
criticize illegitimate claims, regardless of their
institutional and political dignity. This project
is continued in the second and third critiques.
In the Critique of Practical Reason Kant criticizes
existing principles of practical judgment for
covertly including unjustifiable empirical elements which severely qualify human freedom
and autonomy. He proposes instead a “categorical imperative” – “Act only according to that
maxim whereby you can at the same time will that
it should become a universal law” – which would
guard against such qualifications of freedom. In
the Critique of Judgement, the founding text of
modern Aesthetics, Kant criticizes accounts of
aesthetic judgment which rest on either a sense
of the agreeable (for him, eighteenth-century
theories of taste) or an intuition of perfection
(German aesthetic theory). In place of these
“heteronomous” principles he proposes extremely severe conditions for a valid aesthetic
judgment of taste: it must be disinterested, of universal validity but not conceptual, end-directed
but without reference to an end, and necessary.
In seeking a basis for these conditions Kant
turned increasingly to an account of a public,
critical common sense or “Culture.” The work
also contains an extensive analysis of the experience of the sublime and a critical analysis of
teleological judgment.
The ambiguity in Kantian criticism between
the “constructive” establishment of criteria of
legitimate judgment and the “destructive” critique
of all claims to spurious legitimacy has haunted
the reception of his work. Critics from Hegel and
Nietzsche, to Horkheimer, Adorno, Derrida,
and Lyotard regard Kant as having, in
Nietzsche’s words, “broken open the cage” only
to creep back into it. Consequently, twentiethcentury critical theory has been characterized
by the radical extension of criticism to reason
and the human subject itself, not stopping at the
limits established by Kant, but criticizing those
limits themselves. Some critics such as Habermas
regard this development as “irrationalist” and
“anti-Enlightenment”; however, in its “free and
open” examination of reason itself, such radical
critique closely conforms to Kant’s own definition
of the critical Enlightenment as the “free and open
examination” to which “everything must submit.”

secular), and the relationship between criticism
and narrative, which were productively conflated
in the Judeo-Christian tradition of midrash (see
Kermode, 1979). Three recurring themes in
Kermode’s more recent theoretical work have
been the processes of interpretively accommodating classic Texts under varying historical
circumstances (1975; 1985), the historical contingencies of value (1988), and the indispensable
role of the aesthetic appetite in dealing with
works of Art (1990a). As well as being an
extraordinarily accommodating and cooperative
scholar, often working as a coauthor and coeditor, Kermode’s criticism has also been theoretically ecumenical. He has, however, consistently
warned against the loss of the critical vocation in
the wake of current theoretical activity.

`Klein, Melanie (1882–1960) 
Austrian-born
psychoanalyst and pioneer of psychoanalysis of
children. Born in Vienna, Klein apparently first
came into contact with psychoanalytic literature
in Berlin in 1914–15, at which point she went
into analysis with Sandor Ferenczi; her earliest
papers, written in 1921–3 (and now included in
Klein, 1975a) are based upon the direct observation and analysis of her own children. After a move
to Berlin, where a further analysis with Karl
Abraham was truncated by his death, she began
to work with young children and to develop her
distinctive play technique. Contacts with English
analysts subsequently led to an invitation to
London, where Klein settled and lived until
her death and where she immediately found
a much more sympathetic audience than in
Berlin. Increasingly she found herself in demand
as both a child analyst and a training analyst.

Klein’s work is the single most important influence on the Object-relations school. Always a
controversial figure, her differences with Anna
Freud over both theory and technique almost led
to splits within the British Psychoanalytic Society;
an actual schism was avoided by the establishment
of Kleinian, Freudian, and “Middle” groups
within the same society. The Kleinian group is
currently the largest.
Klein’s play technique was born of the impossibility of analyzing young children on the couch
and the realization that play is a form of work and
therefore a possible means of communication. Play
permits a representation of fantasies, wishes, and
experiences, and free play is an equivalent of free
association in adults. Children were allowed to play
with collections of very small toys kept in special
lockers, and with water, paper, and paste. Klein
observed, discussed the games, and joined in as
required. Her approach to games was based on
a strict analytic orthodoxy. Play was a matter
of manipulating and interpreting unconscious
symbols and had no pedagogic content or goal.
The technique resulted from the conviction that
thought is, from the outset, a matter of how
objects – both imaginary and real – are positioned
in relation to one another and the Subject. As a
result, Klein was able to work with children aged
as young as 3 years. Virtually all her theoretical
contributions to Psychoanalysis emerge from
her use of the play technique. It is a measure of
Klein’s success that a notion which seemed so
controversial when it was first introduced now
looks so commonplace.
Klein’s work on the early Oedipus complex
– which, she claimed, was observable at the
beginning of the second year of life; Freud
himself held that truly Oedipal feelings emerged
between the ages of 3 and 5 – convinced her of
the importance of the part-object, in her view
an object for the child rather than for the
instinct, as in Freud’s original formulation. The
breast, for instance, is ascribed properties on
the basis of both the child’s experience of its
mother and the projection of its own fantasies.
Thus the oral gratification afforded by the breast
makes it “good”; its withdrawal or denial makes
it “bad.” At the same time, the child projects
its love on to the gratifying breast and its hate
or aggressiveness on to the bad breast. The
object is thus “split.” One of the key features of

`Kojève, Alexandre (1902–68) 
The bestknown interpreter of Hegel. He was a Russian
émigré who settled in Paris where he taught
his famous Hegel seminar at the Ecole Pratique
des Hautes Etudes from 1933 to 1939. After the
1939–45 war and until his death in 1968, Kojève
worked in the French Ministry of Economic
Affairs, where he was one of the earliest architects
of the European community and the GATT
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
talks.
Kojève’s seminar on Hegel exerted a remarkable influence on a whole generation of French
intellectuals including Raymond Queneau,
Georges Bataille, Maurice Merleau-ponty,
André Breton, Jacques Lacan, Raymond
Aron, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Leading figures of
Postmodernism such as Michel Foucault and
Jacques Derrida also pay tribute to him and
are deeply indebted to his reading of Hegel.
And thanks to his lifelong friendship with Leo
Strauss, his influence on American Straussians
such as Allan Bloom and Francis Fukuyama is
unmistakable.
Kojève read Hegel through the eyes of Marx
and Heidegger simultaneously. For Kojève,
history begins with the relationship between
master and slave and ends with a “universal and
homogeneous state” in which men and women
live in conditions of equality, prosperity, and
mutual recognition, free of war. According to
Kojève, history ends with Capitalism, not Communism. Marx could not have anticipated the fact
that twentieth-century capitalism would overcome
all of its internal contradictions. Capitalism has

successful child development is the integration
of split objects into more realistic forms of
discrimination.
Klein’s concentration on object-relations leads to
a departure from Freud’s emphasis on libidinal
and developmental stages and to a new emphasis on positions, which are not clear-cut structures
but rather characteristic postures adopted by the
ego with regard to its objects. Splitting and the
associated ambivalence toward the object are
characteristic of the paranoid–schizoid position,
possibly the earliest mode of object-relations.
This position is further characterized by the
mechanism of projective identification: the child
has sadistic fantasies of attacking the mother’s
body from within and invading it. As the infant
begins to integrate the good and bad partobjects into a perception of a whole object, it
begins to experience anxiety at the possibility of
losing or destroying its object. This is referred to
as the depressive position, and is regarded by
Klein as resulting originally from the feeling
of guilt aroused by ambivalence to the object.
The depressive position gives rise to a desire to
make reparation to the object and is overcome
through a further process of integration, but
may be reactivated in mourning or depression.
Klein’s relationship with classic Freudian
theory is not an easy one to describe. She is often
criticized by more orthodox Freudians for her
assumption that an intellectually immature child
can perform such complex mental operations,
and the sometimes mechanical quality of her
readiness to interpret a train as the child’s penis
and the station as the mother’s body. On the other
hand, she is one of the rare post-Freudian analysts to take the notion of a death drive and
innate aggression so seriously, and it is certainly
this which gives her work its undoubted emotional
power. The emphasis on the mother, which is a
characteristic feature of object-relations theory in
general, represents a departure from Freud’s
patriarchal emphasis, though it would be difficult
indeed to describe Klein as a feminist.

succeeded in disseminating its wealth throughout
the mass of the population, and in so doing,
it has rendered the socialist revolution impossible or irrelevant because it has deprived it of
its object – ending the impoverishment of the
masses.
Kojève maintained that the age of revolution
is past and that the end of history is already here.
The capitalist imperative has destroyed national
boundaries and created an efficient, rational,
technological, and homogenized world. In so
doing, it has destroyed the ideological grounds
for war – when everyone watches the same television shows, hums the same tunes, loves the
same fast food, and has the same conception of
the good life, what is there to fight about? Global
peace will prevail. The universalistic dream of the
Enlightenment has finally become a reality.
The ideals of freedom, equality, and prosperity
have become the global ends of politics. All that
is left is to work out the technicalities. Civil
servants like Kojève are the order of the day.
Despite his apparent optimism, Kojève did not
romanticize the end of history too much. He
assumed that there would be some obstinate and
irrational people who would pit themselves
against the real and the rational. This is why the
End-State will need a Universal Tyrant. Long
before the end of the Cold War, Kojève anticipated that America would be the heart of the
universal and homogeneous empire and the
model of the new world order.
No sooner did Kojève confer finality on the
rational order of the world than he became
nostalgic for the excitements of the Hegelian
dialectic. The end of history seemed drab, passive,
even animalistic. Scholars describe this as a
“turn” in his thinking, but I believe that his disenchantment is the logical result of his premises.
Kojève offers us a fascistic reading of Hegel’s
dialectic which glorifies negativity, death, terror,
and mastery. Then he posited an end of history
in which these great and glorious attributes have
vanished. The upshot of the matter is that
Kojève transforms Marx’s conception of the
end of history as the “realm of freedom” into
Heidegger’s “night of the world.”
Kojève’s portrayal of the end of history as a
tyranny of an arid, technological rationalism
has contributed a great deal to the postmodern
disenchantment with Enlightenment. It explains

the postmodern repudiation of reason as a sham
which conceals a thirst for global despotism.
Against the Kojèvean vision it may be
objected that the earth cannot sustain a prosperous technological existence for humankind
on a global scale and that the prosperity of
some will always be purchased at the expense of
others. Even if the technological miracle were
possible, Kojève need not have feared that the
excitement of war would become a thing of
the past. Far from pacifying the world, the
homogenization of the globe has fueled tribal
sentiments. All over the globe bloody wars are
being fought, not for concrete ends, but as a
quest for identity and difference in a supposedly
homogeneous world.

thus supplying the psychoanalytic component
that was missing in Saussurean linguistics and
the linguistic component that was missing in
Freudian Psychoanalysis.
Negativity One of Kristeva’s most important
ideas about human consciousness and the
multiplicity of the human subject is negativity, a
concept that she takes over from Hegel’s The
Phenomenology of Mind and greatly expands in the
second section of Part I of Revolution in Poetic
Language (1974). Negativity is fundamental, Hegel
argued (§77–80), to the structure and dynamics
of consciousness. What it is, is a previously
determined structural limit of thought that gets
reincorporated as consciousness expands and
moves forward. For example, I may be a serious
Marxist who later discovers Freud, and I may
end up incorporating my earlier Marxism into my
later post-humanist thinking that is informed
by Freud. Later still, perhaps thanks to Edward
Said, I recover my previously abandoned
humanism without betraying my sense of the
importance of Marx and Freud. The fundamental law of consciousness, Hegel argues in
this context, is that it is constantly expanding, constantly moving forward, constantly breaching
its preconceived limits. But even as it exfoliates,
consciousness retains those previously determined
definitions of itself, and they are what constitute
the negativity of being.
Negativity, thus, plays a major positive role in
what Hegel calls the “history of the education of
consciousness.” Here the dynamically developing consciousness, explicitly characterized by its
reflective notion of itself, is continually advancing beyond its own limits. Accordingly, one of
Hegel’s tentative definitions of consciousness is
“something that goes beyond itself.” The history
of the education of consciousness is composed of
these breaches of the limits of consciousness as
it drives towards its goal of reaching “the point
where knowledge no longer needs to go beyond
itself, where knowledge finds itself, where
Notion corresponds to object and object to
Notion.”
As consciousness drives towards its goal where
knowledge no longer need go beyond itself
– while driving through previously conceived
(false) limits along the way – those instances
of unnecessarily limited consciousness, when

Kristeva, Julia

`Kristeva, Julia (1941–) 
Linguist, psychoanalyst, philosopher, novelist, and critic, born in
Bulgaria. She continued her education in Paris
beginning in 1965 and is a professor of linguistics at the University of Paris 7.
The rich multiplicity of Kristeva’s thought is
simultaneously one of its strongest attractions
and one of its most obvious difficulties, especially
if one is trying to glimpse her project as a whole.
She is a linguist, psychoanalyst, cultural theorist,
philosopher, novelist, literary critic, feminist,
political theorist; but even this list of categories
into which her many texts can be sorted leaves
out other fields touched by several of her major
essays (such as art criticism, biblical studies, and
theology). Furthermore, it is no more satisfactory
to call her work interdisciplinary – or superdisciplinary – than it is to try to tuck her project under
a single, master Episteme. More than thirty
years ago Roland Barthes already realized that
her critical interventions are those of a revolutionary polymath who leaves no system of
thought unchanged. Indeed, as she argues persistently in Revolt, She Said, “revolt is indispensable, both to psychic life and to the bonds that
make society hang together, as long as it remains
a live force and resists accommodations” (p. 3).
Nevertheless, when, in 1973, she was called
upon by The Times Literary Supplement to
describe the essence of her work, she explained
that her central interest is in the speaking subject,
especially as the speaking subject can be understood in relationship to the systems or ideologies
to which the person is subjected from birth. She
put it this way: “What Semiotics has discovered
in studying ‘ideologies’ (myths, rituals, moral
codes, arts, etc.) as sign-systems is that the law
governing, or, if one prefers, the major constraint
affecting any social practice lies in the fact that it
signifies; i.e., that it is articulated like a language”
(Moi, 1986, p. 25.) This does not mean, she is
quick to say, that social practices and human
subjects are nothing but language. Instead, it
means that “Every social practice, as well as
being the object of external (economic, political,
etc.) determinants, is also determined by a set of
signifying rules, by virtue of the fact that there is
present an order of language.” Here, at a stroke,
she disrupts two fields of knowledge at once by
bringing linguistics and psychoanalysis into a
complementary relationship with each other,

exposed as such, are not merely negative in the
sense of being unproductive or of no account. In
Hegel’s view a conception of knowledge that
adopts that sense of the negative, seeing skepticism as “pure nothingness,” is itself a pattern of
untrue or incomplete consciousness, a limit that
waits to be breached. If instead “the exposition
of the untrue consciousness in its untruth” can
be conceived as a determinate negation, seeing x
not merely as not y but as other than y, then negativity can be understood as what gives rise to a
new era in the history of consciousness: “a new
form has thereby immediately arisen, and in the
negation the transition is made through which the
progress through the complete series of forms
comes about of itself.” With this early philosophical basis for her ongoing work, it should not
be surprising that Kristeva consistently celebrates difference, otherness, and the experience of
even being a stranger to ourselves.
Abjection As important as her thinking about
Hegelian negativity continues to be in her later
work, by 1993 Kristeva was prepared to say that
her “psychoanalytical experience enriches and
largely replaces Revolution in Poetic Language”
(unpublished letter); nevertheless, she acknowledged in that earlier work what she called a
“prospective scope” for her later work. Indeed,
that book can profitably be read as itself a kind of
negativity within her ongoing project of understanding the human subject. Like Freud, Kristeva
envisions the history of the human subject as
fundamentally cumulative. Whether she is writing
about the history of the education of consciousness in Revolution in Poetic Language, about the
history of feminism in her essay “Women’s
Time,” or about the trajectory of her own work,
what is past is never passed by or cast off. Such
was the case, as well, with Freud’s understanding
of the cumulative nature of his own project.
As Kristeva herself has observed, however,
there are significant turning points in her work.
One of the most notable of these occurs midway through the collection of essays Desire in
Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and
Art (1980). In her Preface she marks that change
this way:
Readers will . . . notice that a change in writing
takes place as the work progresses. The starker

style, tending toward a kind of formalization,
of the earlier essays, changes progressively as a
psychoanalytic trend is accentuated (as well as
interest in literary and artistic practices), making way for a more personal style. And yet, this
does not go so far as identifying theoretical discourse with that of art – causing theory to be written as literary or para-literary fiction. If there is
a strong post-Heideggerian temptation leading in
that direction, the choice I have made is entirely
different. It assumes the necessity of adopting a
stance involving otherness, distance, even limitation, on the basis of which a structure, a logical
discourse is sutured, hence demonstrable – not
in a banal sense but by giving serious consideration to the new post-Freudian rationality that
takes two stages into account, the conscious and
the unconscious ones, and two corresponding
types of performances. (p. ix)

Here she is careful to point out that she is not
adopting this more personal style at the cost of
the theoretical investment of her earlier work.
Instead, her post-Freudian rationality – which
sustains a double investment in conscious and
unconscious processes, in the disciplines of philosophy and psychoanalysis, and in the kinds of
representation appropriate to each – provides
the enabling foundation for this new phase of
her writing. (In this respect Kristeva anticipates
an important distinction about Freud’s writing
that Adam Phillips later makes in Terrors and
Experts (1995), where he describes the task of
contemporary psychoanalysis this way: “The
contemporary psychoanalyst – who must straddle both projects [of containing] within herself
the Enlightenment Freud and the post-Freudian
Freud, the knowing and the problem of knowing
– becomes a new kind of expert: an expert on the
truths of uncertainty” (p. 8.))
One of the finest achievements of this later stage
of Kristeva’s writing is her work on abjection,
which might be tentatively described as a condition in which a person comes to think of herself
not just as a thing but as a worthless or despised
thing. In abjection the human subject becomes
– or conceives of herself as – an abject object.
Kristeva’s chapters on Sartre in Intimate Revolt
(1997/2002) and her pages on Lacan in Revolution in Poetic Language help to lay the groundwork
for her theory of abjection. Sartre, of course, in
Being and Nothingness and elsewhere, made the

385

Loathing an item of food, a piece of filth, waste,
or dung. The spasms and vomiting that protect
me. The repugnance, the retching that thrusts me
to the side and turns me away from defilement,
sewage, and muck. The shame of compromise,
of being in the middle of treachery. The fascinated
start that leads me toward and separates me
from them.

She then pulls back from this phenomenological
rendering of nausea to comment on it:
Food loathing is perhaps the most elementary and
most archaic form of abjection. When the eyes
see or the lips touch that skin on the surface
of milk – harmless, thin as a sheet of cigarette
paper, pitiful as a nail paring – I experience
a gagging sensation and, still farther down,
spasms in the stomach, the belly; and all the
organs shrivel up the body, provoke tears and
bile, increase heartbeat, cause forehead and
hands to perspire. Along with sight-clouding
dizziness, nausea makes me balk at that milk
cream, separates me from the mother and
father who proffer it. “I” want none of that
element, sign of their desire; “I” do not want
to listen, “I” do not assimilate it, “I” expel it.
But since the food is not an “other” for “me,”
who am only in their desire, I expel myself, I
spit myself out, I abject myself within the same
motion through which “I” claim to establish
myself. (pp. 2–3)

As we read further in this fascinating book,
discovering that it is a diptych when the second
half turns into a commentary on Céline, we
see that the entire project here is an integration
of performative and theoretical language for
the sake of rendering abjection. Even Céline’s
wretched hero in Journey to the End of Night
retches as he is made to turn from his slaughtered
comrades on the battlefield to butcher dead
animals to feed the starving troops.
The metaphor for abjection that Kristeva
discovers in Céline is to be found less in his
characters, plot, and themes than in that
“strange state” we are thrown into when reading
his novels. She puts it this way:
When reading Céline we are seized at that fragile spot of our subjectivity where our collapsed
defenses reveal, beneath the appearances of a
fortified castle, a flayed skin; neither inside nor
outside, the wounding exterior turning into an
abominable interior, war bordering on putrescence, while social and family rigidity, that
beautiful mask, crumbles within the beloved
abomination of innocent vice. A universe of
borders, seesaws, fragile and mingled identities,
wanderings of the subject and its objects, fears
and struggles, abjections and lyricisms. (p. 135)

Kristeva, Julia

fundamental metaphysical distinction between
being in itself (en soi) and being for itself (pour
soi). It is not just that (or so he argued) human
beings are the second and other things that lack
consciousness are the first. Instead, what happens
to greatly complicate human life is that one person may deal with another person – or indeed with
oneself – as though the being for itself is transformed into a being simply in itself. The French
language offers a word for this sort of thingification: chosisme. A wonderful Sartrean example of
chosisme is what happens when a man and a
woman are sitting at a café table and he suddenly
takes her hand when she doesn’t want him to. Not
only does he thoughtlessly grab it as an object, but
she also leaves it there on the table in his hand
like a piece of dead meat. Indeed, they may
continue to talk as though she doesn’t want to
acknowledge that the hand has anything to do with
her, at least not as long as he holds it. Obviously,
when one person begins to take another as
though (to reverse genders for a moment) he
were her possession – not just a hand or other
appendage, but the whole person – the consequences multiply rapidly. Nevertheless, it is one
thing to treat someone else – even in defiance of
their will – as a partial or totally desired object,
and quite another to treat them as a despised or
loathed thing, an abject object. Yet a further complication arises when the object himself thinks of
himself abjectly despite whatever her intention or
action might actually be. Not to mention, of
course, if there is no she for him at all.
Kristeva’s Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection is both a carefully articulated theory of
abjection (Chapters 1–5) and a study of the
novels of Céline (Chapters 6–10) as a novelistic
rendering of the I that is not I. Vomiting is both
a key metaphor for abjection and under certain
circumstances a symptom of it, as in a range of
eating disorders from anorexia to bulemia.
Kristeva writes:

Kristeva, Julia

386
Céline, of course, did not confine his exploration
of abjection to his fiction. It spilled over into
his notorious anti-Semitic pamphleteering and
into his obsession with Jewish dietary laws. It is
not these excesses of his that prompt Kristeva in
The Powers of Horror to devote a chapter to “The
semiotics of biblical abomination.” Instead, the
purpose of that chapter is to demonstrate how
deeply abjection is written into our culture. She
puts it this way: “Abjection – dietary, sanguine,
and moral – is pushed back within the chosen
people, not because they are worse than others,
but because in the light of the contract that they
alone have entered into, abjection appears as
such” (p. 107).
Feminine Genius Although negativity and
abjection are both kinds of negation, negativity
is an affirmative form in the sense that it is a fundamental element in the forward movement of
consciousness, while abjection is a psychological
and cultural consequence of disgust. Feminine
genius and revolt, on the other hand, are forms
of affirmation that are essential for overcoming
maladies of the soul. In the opening pages of the
first volume of her trilogy, The Feminine Genius
(1999), Kristeva announces her determination
to recover a sense of genius as it was understood
by the ancient Romans. For them (see especially
Horace, Ep.ii.2.187–9) genius had nothing in
particular to do with exceptional intellectual or
artistic talent or with a person, such as Bach
or Einstein, who exhibited such talent. Instead, it
was the numen, or indwelling spirit of a person.
Originally, this was thought to be a sexual power
that gave to a man the capacity for generation;
but later this idea grew to denote the “full powers of developed manhood” (Oxford Companion
to Classical Literature, p. 185). The equivalent
power in a woman was called “Juno,” after
the female counterpart of Jupiter. As Kristeva
explains in the concluding chapter to the third
volume of The Feminine Genius, for her, genius
is the capacity for self-transcendence that includes, for example, in the instances of Hannah
Arendt, Melanie Klein, and Colette, their
power to transcend their respective fields of
political philosophy, psychoanalysis, and literature.
“Indeed, I am persuaded,” she confesses, “that
the ultimate result of the rights of man and of
woman is nothing other than the Scottist ideal,

which our age now has the means to realize: . . .
care granted to the flowering of our singularity,
concern for the advent of the ‘who’ within the ‘anything whatever’ – with ‘genius’ being the most
complex, the most seductive, the most fertile version of singularity at a given historical moment,
and solely on these conditions, inscribed in
duration and in the universal” (III, p. 404).
As a concept and an achievable ideal, feminine
genius stands over and against the Freudian
imago as elaborated by Lacan in his famous
paper on “The Mirror stage.” The imago is the
image that is projected onto me from birth of the
sort of person I am expected to (and that I come
to expect of myself that I should) become. As an
image of wholeness and literal individuality, it is
such an impossibility that my only true relationship to it (this thing that I think should be me)
is one of tragic alienation, especially when I
devote myself to efforts to achieve it. This is even
more the case for girls who have to contend
with cultural and psychoanalytic institutions that
inflect this impossible sense of what she must
become with variously elaborated images of the
integrated phallus. Although she doesn’t say so
explicitly, because she recapitulates her three
cumulative stages of the history of feminism – the
demand for political rights, the assertion of
ontological equality, and the search for sexual
difference – in the midst of her manifesto for
feminine genius (III, pp. 404–5), Kristeva implies
that this power of self-transcendence is potentially available as an outcome of those stages in
the history of “women’s time.” In retrospect, she
says, there now appears a recognizable problem
in “the totalizing ambitions” of feminism as
a libertarian movement stemming from the
Enlightenment. Here it is impossible to miss an
echo of her candid revelations in About Chinese
Women (1974) following her trip to the People’s
Republic of China in April/May 1974. What she
learned on that occasion was the mistake in
thinking of feminism as a totalizing movement.
Here she recasts that realization this way: “We are
only too aware today of the impasses entailed by
these total and totalitarian promises. Feminism
itself, whatever its various currents in Europe
and America, has not escaped from these aims and,
in the end, this tendency has rigidified into a shortlived militantism, which, ignoring the singularity
of subjects, believes it can encompass all women,

387

Revolt Not even the most casual reader of
Kristeva since 1974 would be likely to miss how
many of her books refer to revolution or its
derivatives in their titles: Revolution in Poetic
Language, The Sense and Non-sense of Revolt,
Intimate Revolt, and Revolt, She Said. It is clear
from all that she has written on this subject that
Kristeva believes that revolt is essential to psychic
life no less than it is to social bonds. Part of the
reason for this insistence is that she sees revolt
against previously conceived limits of thought as
fundamental to the dynamics of consciousness,
that she is convinced that resistance to objectification is an essential part of the battle against
abjection, and that she understands the struggle
to affirm feminine genius as critical to a woman’s
self-transcendence. Furthermore, underlying all
of these acts of revolt is Freud’s observation in
Civilization and Its Discontents that the passionate nature of human life keeps us perpetually
in a condition of discontent with those forces of
civilization that are designed particularly to tame
our passions.
In the opening chapter to Intimate Revolt, however, her call to resist has a particular urgency:
Against whom can we revolt if power is vacant
and values corrupt? Or, to put it even more
gravely, who can revolt if man has become a simple conglomerate of organs, no longer a subject
but a patrimonial person, a person belonging to
the patrimony, financially, genetically, and
physiologically, a person barely free enough to use
a remote control to choose his channel. I am oversimplifying and darkening this depiction of our
current state in order to highlight what we all
sense: not only that political revolt is being

mired in compromise between parties whose
differences are less and less obvious to us but
especially that an essential component of European culture – a culture fashioned by doubt and
critique – is losing its moral and aesthetic
impact. This moral and aesthetic dimension
finds itself marginalized and exists only as a
decorative alibi tolerated by the society of the
spectacle, when it is not simply submerged,
made impossible by entertainment culture, performance culture, and show culture. (p. 4)

The deadening malaise that has spread over
contemporary culture is a consequence of the
stifling of doubt and critique that are essential
elements in the post-Enlightenment culture of
Europe and America. As serious as are the consequences of this intellectual malaise for political
life and social life, they are no less damaging in
their psychic effects to our moral and aesthetic
life. Both “the intimacy on which our notion
of happiness depends” and “the social link that
determines what we call politics” (p. 3) are seriously threatened by the systematic stifling of
healthy forms of revolt. Indeed, we are in danger
of being left with simply the evacuated forms
of liberty and those other potentially empty
legacies of the French and American revolutions.
Kristeva persistently gives us real hope that these
dangers can be overcome.

like all proletarians or the entire Third World,
with demands as relentless as they are desperate”
(III, p. 405).
It is impossible to miss in these sentences
Kristeva’s exemplary determination to put herself
on the line and to be accountable for what
she thinks and writes. But there is also here an
engaging modesty that may be a distinguishing
feature of her feminine genius. As ambitious as
her project continues to be, it is also dynamically
vital, eager to transcend itself, incorporating its
previous sense of its own limits as it moves
forward, and persistently affirmative of creative
revolt.

North
American anthropologist. Kroeber received an
MA in English literature in 1897 and a PhD in
anthropology under Franz Boas at Columbia
University in 1901. From then, almost until his
death, he taught anthropology and was museum
curator (later director) at the University of
California at Berkeley. Kroeber conducted fieldwork in the Philippines and Peru, although he
is better known for his work among Native
American groups in California and the southwestern United States, especially his work with
the cultural informant he called Ishi, reputedly
the last survivor of the traditional Yahi Indians
of northern California.
Influenced by the historical particularism of
Boas, Kroeber avoided scientific explanation and
the formulation of universal laws of Culture
(nomothetic approach) in favor of description and
the tracing of cultural patterns in time and location (ideographic approach) as a primary purpose
of his (and anthropology’s) efforts. Kroeber
stressed the humanistic rather than the scientific
side of anthropology and Cultural studies,
but the question of how cultural customs and styles
arise, spread, and decline dominated his work. He
stressed multiple causality in explaining cultural
phenomena, and he argued against all forms of
reductionist explanations, affirming instead that
“the immediate causes of cultural phenomena
are other cultural phenomena.” This led him to
formulate the concept of the “superorganic” – that
some areas of culture develop quite independently of other areas more linked to biological
needs and environmental constraints – for
which he was criticized. A skillful writer, teacher,
and organizer of information, Kroeber produced
over 500 works, including some of massive scope
in the history of cultural studies.

`Kuhn, Thomas S. (1922–1996) 
American
historian and philosopher of science. After
producing a number of historical studies, Kuhn
published The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
(1962), a historiographical study of science
which has had an impact far exceeding that
expected – or even desired – by its author.
Although Kuhn published further works, it is
The Structure which has remained centerstage to
become one of the most influential texts of
recent decades. Its force grew from its challenge
to the traditional historical picture of science
as continuous and progressive development.
Instead, Kuhn offered an account in which the
history of science is constituted by stable, almost
dogmatic periods of research (“normal science”)
separated by radical discontinuities (“scientific
revolutions”).
For Kuhn the fundamental unit of analysis
is the scientific community. Its members are
bound together by their professional education,
which in turn is based on previous scientific
achievements. A particular scientific community,
concerned with some scientific specialism, will look
to the achievement that founded that specialism
as the basis for its continuing research. Such an
achievement is what Kuhn calls a Paradigm,
and research based on a paradigm is what he calls
“normal science.”
A paradigm, which is constituted by a shared
commitment to a constellation of laws, theories,
techniques, and standards, will have had some
success in solving scientific problems, and will
therefore constitute a way of thinking about
further problems, the idea being to extend the
existing success of the paradigm into new areas.
A paradigm must therefore be open-ended as
well as successful, but its further development is
essentially self-limiting: it cannot challenge its
own foundations. This is why normal science is
“puzzle-solving,” seeking further articulation of

389
basis. Whether this is compatible with genuine
incommensurability must, however, remain
questionable.
A second major problem for Kuhn is the
ambiguous use of the term “paradigm,” which
includes major changes like the one from the
Ptolemaic to the Copernican world view, with
all its religious, social, and ideological consequences, and changes such as the development
of the oxygen theory of combustion, of interest
only to specialists. This led Kuhn to distinguish
the broader commitments of a scientific community (the “disciplinary matrix”) from the
particular achievements (“exemplars”) which
were the basis of normal science, and to claim that
it was the latter that were the subjects of his
account of paradigms.
However, this attempt at terminological restriction has not been very successful, and neither
has Kuhn’s more general attempt to limit the use
of his ideas. Kuhn stated that his account of
paradigms and revolutions was specific to the
natural sciences, and that no other area exhibits
the requisite maturity or discipline in its structure to be susceptible to his analysis. But very
little attention has been paid to this ruling,
and paradigms in the broad, ambiguous sense
have continued to populate the writings of psychologists, sociologists, economists, historians,
philosophers, literary theorists, and cultural
analysts of all sorts.
This is just as it should be, for no author has
the right to limit the uses to which his or her ideas
are put, and no Text can prescribe the limits
of its own reception. Yet Kuhn’s work was
fundamentally misunderstood from the start.
Appearing in the 1960s, The Structure was bound
to be assimilated to the revolutionary spirit of the
times, and even to be appropriated by the antiscientific skepticism of the following decades.
But far from being a radical tract for its times, it
is in fact a highly conservative defense of natural
science and the procedures followed by its practitioners. It is a defense based on history and
sociology, an attempt to move away from any
philosophical or value-based account of science,
and to present an account of scientific development in purely factual terms. But, rightly, the
origin of Kuhn’s project has failed to restrict its
influence.
See also Science, philosophy of.

Kuhn, Thomas S.

the paradigm but eschewing major novelties. As
Kuhn puts it, normal scientific research is “a
strenuous and devoted effort to force nature into
conceptual boxes supplied by professional education” (1970, p. 5).
While the paradigm continues to solve puzzles,
its success will be cumulative, but never total.
Although there will be many failures accompanying the successes, one of Kuhn’s major claims is
that such failures are not falsifying counterinstances, as Popper claimed, but are merely
regarded as anomalies, or are even not regarded
at all. It is only when anomalies pile up, or when
the members of a scientific community begin
to feel insecure about them, that they play a
significant role in science. When anomalies
become too numerous or too serious they will
precipitate a crisis for the community, a realization that the paradigm is no longer serving its
purpose as the basis for normal research. The
response will be a proliferation of ideas and
theories from which a new paradigm will eventually emerge. Then a scientific revolution will have
taken place.
For Kuhn a scientific revolution is a noncumulative event, a discontinuity or radical break that
changes everything. In sociological terms, two
paradigms represent “incompatible modes of
community life” (1970, p. 94). Paradigms are
incommensurable – literally cannot be measured against each other – because they have
no internal standards in common and do not
acknowledge external standards. It follows from
this account that science cannot be progressive
in the traditionally accepted way, for there is
no basis for saying that a new paradigm is better
than the one it superseded; yet Kuhn does want
to retain a vestige of progressivism in science,
claiming that its development through revolutions is like irreversible evolution from primitive
beginnings.
One major criticism of Kuhn is that his
account of scientific revolutions brings irrationality into science, for there is no good reason
for paradigm choice, and Kuhn’s use of terms
like “Gestalt-switch” and “conversion experience” simply fuels the critics’ ire. Yet it is clear
that a new paradigm must succeed in restarting the puzzle solving which broke down with
the crisis in the previous paradigm, even though
this process has, at it were, shifted to a new

`Lacan, Jacques (1901–81) 
French psychoanalyst. Lacan was without doubt the most
controversial psychoanalyst since Freud. He
was also one of the most authoritative and had
considerable impact both inside and outside the
psychoanalytic community, influencing developments in Literary criticism, philosophy,
feminism, and film theory.
Lacan’s career was a stormy one. Elected to
the Institut Psychanalytique de Paris in 1934, he
and others resigned from it in 1953 to found the
Société Psychanalytique de Paris. Their departure
resulted in the withdrawal of recognition by the
International Psychoanalytic Association. The
issues leading to the resignation were complex,
consisting of a great deal of internal politics and
a number of personality clashes, although centered
on Lacan’s use of variable or short sessions in
his training analyses and refusal to adhere to
the convention of the analytic hour. In 1963 the
same issue resulted in splits within the SPP
(which was never recognized by the IPA) and
in the founding of Lacan’s Ecole Freudienne de
Paris. Lacan regarded his treatment at the hand
of the IPA as an excommunication and likened
it (1973, pp. 3–4) to the kherem and the later
chammata that expelled Spinoza from the synagogue.
The EFP was a flourishing, if perpetually crisisridden organization, but was unilaterally dissolved
by Lacan in 1980. A number of rival organizations
now claim to be the legitimate heirs to Lacan’s
thought; the most important is the Ecole du

Champ Freudien, directed by Lacan’s son-in-law
and literary executor Jacques-Alain Miller (see
Roudinesco, 1986).
Lacan’s only “real” book is his doctoral thesis,
which discusses the relationship between paranoid
psychoses and personality (Lacan, 1932). His
reputation rests primarily on the papers which
he reluctantly collected as Ecrits (1966). Prior to
their publication, the main channel for the transmission of Lacan’s teachings was the seminar
which began as a private study group reading the
“Dora” case (Freud, 1905a) in 1951, and which
gradually developed into a public forum and one
of the more notorious spectacles of Parisian
intellectual life. The seminar is in the course of
publication; three volumes are currently available
in English translation (Lacan, 1973, 1975, 1978).
Lacan originally trained as a doctor of medicine and a psychiatrist before entering analysis with
Rudolph Lowenstein in 1934, and soon gained
a reputation as a clinician and diagnostician of
outstanding acumen. His earliest publications
were in medical journals and deal with paranoid
psychoses; they owe a great deal more to French
psychiatric traditions and particularly to his
teacher Clérambault than to Freud. In the doctoral
thesis, for example, the pre-Freudian categories
of mental automatism and erotomania are
invoked to explain the origins of paranoia. During the 1930s Lacan was close to the surrealists;
his early attempts to find a parallel between
literary forms and pathology are definitely related

Lacan, Jacques

L

Lacan, Jacques

392
to their artistic practices and to both Salvador
Dali’s critical paranoia and Breton’s promotion
of automatic writing. The association with the
surrealists is not surprising; to his chagrin, Freud
was given a much warmer reception by the surrealists than by the French medical and psychiatric establishments (see Macey, 1988) and it
was in the same milieu that Lacan’s thesis found
its most avid readers. Surrealism was to remain
an important influence; many of the literary
allusions that abound in Lacan’s writings are to
surrealist authors and his very style owes something to their work.
Lacan’s first major contribution to psychoanalytic theory is his description of the Mirrorstage. His account of this crucial phase in
development is strongly marked by the Hegelianism of Kojève (see the Other), and the same
influence is also apparent in the related paper
in which Transference is recast as a dialectical
series of identifications (Lacan, 1951). Despite
the sophistication of Lacan’s wide-ranging philosophical references and his incorporation of
elements of Heidegger, Kojève’s reading of
Hegel provides the most solid philosophical
underpinnings for his theories.
It was the manifesto-like paper read to the
1953 Conference of the SPP and known as the
Rome Discourse that truly announced Lacan’s
return to Freud (Lacan, 1953, in 1966 and
1977). The slogan had two primary meanings. On
the one hand, Lacan was calling for a return to
a close reading of Freud’s Text, for a literal
reading of Freud, rather than the accumulated
secondary literature. The accomplishment of that
reading was the constant goal of the seminar.
The slogan also expressed a bitter hostility to ego
psychology, seen as a dominant Ideology and
a form of behaviorism which obscures Freud’s
inspiration and even the discovery of the unconscious. For Lacan, ego psychology represented
the adaptation of the individual to an environment and a suppression of the Freudian discovery
that, as the mirror-stage demonstrated, the ego
was the product of alienating identification, was
not coterminous with the Subject and could
therefore not be master in its own house.
Lacan takes quite literally Anna O’s definition
of Psychoanalysis as a talking cure (see Breuer
and Freud, 1893–5). Speech is the sole medium
of the analysis, and the function and field of

speech and language must be central to both
psychoanalytic clinical practice and the training
of psychoanalysts. In his 1953 paper Lacan does
not invoke any specific linguistic theory, but
refers to a general concept of speech and language which draws upon sources as diverse as
Heidegger and Lévi-strauss (1949). Heidegger
supplies the dichotomy between empty and full
speech, referring respectively to the stereotypical
Discourse in which the analysand is alienated
and the effective and therapeutic use of a speech
which can take account of the other. Lévi-Strauss
is used by Lacan to outline the all-important
theory of language as a Symbolic system. Language is the element which defines subjectivity
because its use always implies a reference to the
other. The symbolic is an order superimposed
upon the domain of nature, in which there are
no lines of descent or systems of kinship. Freud’s
theory of the Oedipus complex can now be
reformulated in terms of the subject’s inscription
within a symbolic system which prohibits incest
as the subject submits to the law that is pronounced in the Name of the father.
The symbolic is one of the three interconnected
orders that structure intersubjective existence
(see Imaginary, symbolic, real). A similarly
triadic structure, which may contain a reference
to Freud’s triad of id, ego, and super-ego, appears
in the triple structure of need, demand, and
desire, which, like the theory of the symbolic,
relates to the transition from nature to Culture. Need refers quite simply to a biological level
and the need for nutrition. Demand describes the
expression of need in language: the subject is
obliged to express or translate biological need in
symbolic terms. The residue, or the incompatibility between need and demand, is referred to
by Lacan as desire, which rapidly becomes the
central theme. Whereas Freud’s patients were
driven by wishes and impulses, Lacan’s subjects
are driven by desire, and he can therefore claim
that the psychoanalytic equivalent to Descartes’s
cogito is desidero. Elements of the theory of desire
can be seen in the theorization of the mirror-stage,
and it is clear that Lacan’s debt to Kojève is still
enormous in the 1960 paper on the dialectic of
desire and the subversion of the subject (1960, in
1966 and 1977) and in the argument that man’s
desire is the desire of the other. Ultimately, desire
is always a desire for recognition. Like Freud

393
return to Freud, his work has found varied
applications and has effectively become part of a
general cultural field in which psychoanalysis is
an element in broader elaborations. In the 1960s
that field seemed to promise an articulation
between Marxism and psychoanalysis which
could provide a materialist account of how
subjects were constituted in and by Ideology
(Althusser, 1964). Lacan thus became part of a
triple alliance with Althusser and Foucault, the
common denominator being their theoretical
anti-humanism. That alliance paved the way for
an initial appropriation by feminism (Mitchell,
1974), though the Marxist component was soon
lost. The appeal for feminists was that Lacan
appeared to offer a way around the more problematic pronouncements of Freud on femininity
and that the theory of the phallus avoided Freud’s
residual biologism by theorizing the symbolic
or even formal constitution of Gender identities.
Not all feminists accept that argument and the
question of Lacan’s relevance to feminism
remains highly controversial (see Irigaray, 1977).
The importance ascribed to the figure of the
phallus exposes Lacan to the serious charge of
Phallo-gocentrism, while the primacy he
accords to language and the signifier exposes
him to the criticism that he has in fact reproduced
the theological theory that “in the beginning was
the Word.”

Lacan, Jacques

before him, Lacan frequently claims not to be a
philosopher, but his theorization of desire relies
heavily upon themes that ultimately derive from
Hegel.
It is really only in the 1957 paper on the
“Agency of the letter” (1957, in Lacan, 1966 and
1977) that linguistics begins to be appropriated
by Lacan. The linguistics in question is that of
Saussure, though Lacan also makes much use
of the work of Jakobson’s work on phonemes
and on Metaphor and metonymy. Following
Saussure, language is seen as a synchronic system
of discrete units, and meaning is seen as emerging
from their interaction. As Lacan puts it, meaning insists in and through a chain of signifiers;
it does not consist of any one element. It is the
primacy accorded to the signifier that signals
Lacan’s departure from Saussurean orthodoxy.
Whereas the linguist stressed the meaningful
unity of signifier and signified within the Sign,
the psychoanalyst divorces the two and stresses
that there is no final correspondence between
the two poles. Signifier and signified will never
coincide in any absolute sense, and it is only the
privileged signifier known as the Phallus that
guarantees an element of stability by putting an
end to the otherwise interminable sliding of the
signifier. Lacan’s appropriation of elements of
Saussure allows him to argue that the Unconscious is structured like a language, a claim
further supported by the perceived similarity
between the formations of the unconscious
(symptoms, Dream-work) and the rhetorical
figures of Metaphor and metonymy, which
are held, following Jakobson, to represent the
two poles of the workings of language.
Lacan’s claim that the unconscious is structured
like a language has always been controversial. To
some analysts, it represents an intellectualization
of psychoanalysis which effectively avoids the
entire issue of effect and emotion (Green, 1986),
while it has often been pointed out that Lacan’s
reliance on early Freudian texts like The Interpretation of the Dreams (Freud, 1900) and Jokes
and Their Relation to the Unconscious (Freud,
1905b), which lend themselves much more easily
to a linguistic reading than, say, The Ego and the
Id (Freud, 1923), means that his return to Freud
is based upon a highly selective reading.
Although Lacan saw his primary work as the
formation of analysts and the defense of the

French philosopher and literary theorist, much
influenced by the work of Heidegger, Derrida,
and Lyotard. He wrote mainly about topics in
the history of French and German post-Romantic
thought, including the intensely problematical
relationship between Art, representation, Ethics,
and politics. Lacoue-Labarthe traces this relationship back to its origins in Plato’s ambivalent
doctrine of mimesis, and thence forward, via
Kant, to its latterday emergence in those forms
of highly charged aesthetic Ideology – from
Nietzsche to (at least certain aspects of)
Heidegger’s thinking – which raise such values into
a touchstone of revealed historic and political
truth. This project is pursued with great subtlety,
range of scholarship, and critical rigor in
The Literary Absolute (coauthored with JeanLuc Nancy) and in Typography, a series of interlinked essays on the theme of mimetic desire,
rivalry, and the politics of representation. LacoueLabarthe is at his weakest – like so many commentators – when attempting to make out a case
for Heidegger as the deepest thinker of these and
related issues.

`language, philosophy of 
Despite obvious
interconnections, philosophy of language should
be distinguished from (i) linguistic philosophy,
(ii) philosophy of linguistics, and (iii) semantics
(in the “professional” sense). The first of these is
a method, applicable in all areas of philosophy,

marked by close attention to the use of words. The
second is a branch of philosophy of Science,
concerned with the specialist vocabulary and
methodology of linguistics. The third is a program
for assigning objects, classes, etc. to words so as
to yield specifications of the truth conditions of
sentences.
Philosophy of language is the attempt, primarily, to provide an integrated and illuminating
general account of the relations between language and speakers, and language and the world.
(A language, after all, is both used by and
between people, and about the world.) In the one
area belong such various issues as the innateness
of linguistic knowledge alleged by Chomsky,
and the proper taxonomy of the speech acts
whereby we “do things with words.” In the second
belong issues like the parallelism (or lack of it)
between structures of language and reality, and
the nature of referential expressions. The two
areas come together in the theory of meaning.
No account of meaning can be adequate which
does not explain both how people understand
words and how words relate to the world. A
common criticism of the view that meanings
are “ideas” in the head is that this leaves
unclarified how words “get a grip” on reality.
Equally, “realist” theories – in terms, for instance, of the objective truth conditions of
sentences – are sometimes criticized for leaving
unclarified how words manage to be grasped by
speaker/hearers.
A striking feature of twentieth-century philosophy is the central place occupied by philosophy
of language. Several factors have contributed to
this “linguistic turn.” First, developments in
logic not only provided new tools for the analysis of language (for example, quantifiers), but
also revealed apparent gaps between a grammatical “surface” and the underlying logic which,
many philosophers held, language must possess.
This perception inspires the attempt – variously
undertaken by, say, Frege, Russell, Chomsky, and
Davidson – to analyze everyday language into its
logical structures.
Second, there has been the growing sense,
partly inspired by psychology and anthropology,
of the intimate connection between thought
and language. Here we need to distinguish two
themes, both prominent in the later work of
Wittgenstein. One is that the very criteria for

`language theories 
There are many different
ways of studying language. In any field certain
kinds of issues tend to dominate research at a given
time, and certain kinds of theories are proposed
in response to them. If one theory is dominant
for a time and is then replaced with another,
there are usually historical forces at work which
it makes sense to try and identify. The relationship between a theory and its historical context
can be straightforward or complex, and clarifying this relationship can be the best way to grasp
what theories set out to do.

The development of language theories can
usefully be surveyed as follows. For each phase
we can identify the historical background, what
the key issues were taken to be, and the main
theories that were formulated. And we can say how
the main scholars of each period would have
answered the questions: “What is language?” and
“What is theory?”
The first coherent theories of language in
modern times were developed in the early nineteenth century as a result of changes in European
colonialism. Earlier colonialists had been happy
to wipe out the original inhabitants of the lands
they seized, or to use them for slave labor in
agriculture. Industrialization made it necessary to
develop a larger administrative and managerial elite
in the colonies, and the colonial powers therefore
reluctantly decided to educate at least some of
the “natives.” Part of the process was a drive
to convert them to Christianity. Administrators
and missionaries began to study the languages
of their colonial subjects.
It soon became clear that some of these “exotic”
languages were not so exotic after all: Sanskrit, the
language of the ancient Hindu scriptures, was
found to have striking similarities to classical
Latin and Greek; and living tongues like Persian,
Sinhalese, and Hindi were similar to many of the
languages of Europe. The obvious question was:
How come? The field of comparative philology
emerged as scholars attempted to solve this puzzle.
The theory that prevailed was that all these languages were descendents of one language, dubbed
Indo-European, which was spoken in Eastern
Europe and Asia Minor in prehistoric times (cf.
Lehman, 1967; Thieme, 1955).
This theory rested on two crucial foundations.
First, scholars had to develop precise tools for
analyzing the most concrete features of different
languages, namely their sounds and their word
structure. The relevant fields, phonetics and
morphology respectively, therefore made huge
strides. Second, it was necessary to have a general
theory of how and why languages changed to
prevent the kind of wild speculation that had
flourished in some previous attempts to map the
origins of words. A rigorous theory of language
change duly emerged. In the early part of the
century a key figure like Franz Bopp (1791–1867)
would have said that language was an organism
which had decayed and been simplified since the

language theories

identifying thoughts are necessarily linguistic. One
cannot ascribe this or that thought or concept
to a creature without its capacity to manifest it
verbally. The other is that the general ways in
which a society of Culture thinks and conceives of reality is inextricably bound up with the
language it happens to speak. Both philosophical
psychology and philosophical anthropology, therefore, require a philosophy of language.
Finally, it is apparent that doctrines about
language and meaning can have profound and
disturbing implications for philosophy at large.
A striking example was the logical positivists’
verificationist theory of meaning. If only empirically verifiable sentences (and those of logic) are
meaningful, then the pronouncements of theology, Ethics, and philosophy itself must be a
kind of nonsense. More recently, the “disappearance of the self ” and “death of the Author”
conclusions of “poststructuralist” writers in
France are drawn from the idea that a person is,
so to speak, a fly caught in a free-floating web
of unstable meanings over which he or she has
no autonomous control or grip.

glories of classical times. Asked about theory,
he would have mentioned analytical rigor and the
importance of general patterns. Later scholars
such as Karl Brugmann (1849–1919) would have
disagreed with the word “decay” in the first
answer, but accepted the second answer, stressing the word “general.”
By the early part of the twentieth century a new
puzzle began to come to the fore. Technological
progress meant that even more “natives” had to
be educated and made literate. Once again it was
the missionaries who led the way, setting up
mission schools in the colonies and translating the
Bible into the local languages. Whereas in the previous period the focus had been on dead languages,
and hence on writing rather than speech, the
central questions now were how to describe
living languages accurately, particularly spoken
language, and how to design writing systems for
those (the majority) which did not have one.
Solving the first question was the major impulse
behind the structuralist theories of language that
were developed in Europe and America during this
period. These theories made the structure of
languages (sounds, words, syntax) their central
concern, marginalizing or ignoring questions of
the meaning and use of language. There were
two reasons for the emphasis on structure. First,
it was thought that meaning and use were not
amenable to rigorous scientific investigation.
Second, scholars wanted to describe each language in its own terms, rather than carrying over
the analytical terminology used for European
languages, a practice that had had adverse consequences when modern languages were described
in school grammars using concepts from Latin
and Greek grammar. The structuralist linguistics
of this period aimed to provide a set of automatic
procedures by which a linguist could extract the
structures of any language from a moderate
amount of data (see Zellig Harris).
The second issue, creating writing systems,
led to further refinements in studying the sound
systems of different languages, the field of phonology. The concept of the phoneme – a class of
sounds in a language which do not contrast with
each other – was central here. In English, for
instance, the “l” sounds in feel and leaf are different; but one always appears at the beginning
of a word while the other appears at the end:
they are members of the same phoneme and can

therefore be represented in writing by the same
letter. This type of reasoning was important in
devising efficient writing systems. Writing systems
also raised social and political problems, however.
The African language Shona is a good example.
Far from being one language, Shona is a cluster
of dialects which differ in their pronunciation,
grammar, and vocabulary. One dialect, called
Zezuru, was used as the basis for the writing
system (and the dictionaries and grammars) of
“standard Shona.” Zezuru was used because it
happened to be the dialect of Harare (then called
Salisbury), where most Europeans settled.
The period of Structuralism coincided with
the growth of organized nationalist resistance
to colonialism in many colonies. Treating each
language in its own terms as a complex structure
fitted in well with the emphasis on taking pride
in traditional languages and Cultures that was
promoted by these nationalist movements (and
supported by many linguists). Recording indigenous languages for posterity was also important
because many of them were dying out as a result
of the earlier genocidal colonialism mentioned
above, which still persisted in certain parts of
the world.
The main figures of this period were Ferdinand
de Saussure (1857–1913) in Europe, and Leonard
Bloomfield (1887–1949) in America (cf. Saussure,
1913; Bloomfield, 1933). A language for Bloomfield was considered to be all the utterances produced by a speech community. Asked about
theory, he would have talked about a reliable
method for collecting, analyzing, and organizing
these utterances.
The next major change is linked with the 1939–
45 war. Expertise in languages such as German,
Russian, or Japanese became an important
strategic asset for the allied powers during and after
the war, and the armed forces needed quick and
efficient ways of learning these and other languages.
After the war, languages that had not been widely
studied in Europe and America, such as Arabic,
Chinese, and Malay, became important. Many
of the structuralist linguists were drafted in to
design language teaching materials, and the field
of “applied linguistics” made its appearance as
the question of how best to learn and teach new
languages became the central one. Repetitive
structural drills were the favored solution, resulting from the emphasis on structure in linguistics

397
historical linguistics; indeed, Bloomfield’s classic
1933 book contains some excellent discussion
of how the meanings of words change over time,
as well as the better-known claim that the study
of meaning is not a part of scientific linguistics.
Furthermore, each phase influenced the next:
the tools developed and the results achieved in
one period laid the groundwork for the next (see
Robins, 1967, for a more complete picture).
Second, relating each period to its historical
background should not be taken as denigrating
the achievements of the scholars concerned. The
reconstruction of Indo-European, for instance,
in the complete absence of supporting historical
or archaeological evidence, must rank among the
great intellectual achievements in history. Analyzing previously unrecorded languages, teaching
languages, and making proposals about genetic
properties of languages – these all demand
intensive thought and hard work. In general,
developing novel ideas is difficult – certainly
much more difficult than seeing in hindsight
why it happened.
Third, the theories surveyed here have always
been built by a small minority of scholars concerned with language. Most of those who work
with language are interested in description rather
than theory, in learning or teaching languages, or
helping people with language problems, more
than with intellectual structures. This is not surprising: there are more car mechanics in the
world than theoretical physicists for the same
reason. Both have their part to play in the scheme
of things.

langue/parole 
`A fundamental dichotomy in
Structuralism derived from the work of

langue/parole

and from the influence of behaviorism (a set of
techniques for rewarding desired behaviors and
penalizing unwanted ones) in psychology. Key
figures were Earl Stevick and Robert Lado (cf.
Lado, 1964). Asked to define language, early
applied linguists would have talked of a set of
habits learned from experience. A theory for
them was a set of practical techniques that reliably produced a desired outcome.
At the end of the war the United States had
by far the most powerful economy in the world,
and embarked on what people later wistfully
remembered as the postwar boom, fueled in large
part by massive military spending and armed
intervention anywhere that the strategic interests
of the country and its allies were threatened.
The relative freedom from economic pressures in
some sections of the population enabled scholars
to look beyond the urgent practical questions
of the previous two periods. Technology made
huge strides, and the invention of the computer
in particular was indirectly responsible for the
emergence of the next set of puzzles, since it led
to a new branch of mathematics called formal
language theory, one of whose practitioners was
Noam Chomsky.
Chomsky takes the view that language – more
accurately, the grammar of a language – can only
be seen coherently if we regard it as a system of
knowledge in the mind of a person who speaks
that language. He goes on to argue that many
properties of language are innate in humans:
each of us, he says, has abstract grammatical
rules and principles encoded in our genes –
programmed into our brains, if you prefer. The
grammar of a particular language emerges when
certain limited choices allowed by the genetic
program are made by the young person acquiring
language, on the basis of simple data available to
any child. What Chomsky developed, then, is
a biological theory of language. Asked to define
language, Chomsky would say that it is not a useful concept: the interesting concept is grammar,
seen as a biological system. A theory for Chomsky
is an attempt to explain why some part of the
world is the way it is (cf. Chomsky, 1988; Salkie,
1990).
Some remarks are needed to complete this
picture. First, the four phases were not as discrete
as I have portrayed them. For instance, both
Saussure and Bloomfield did important work in

Ferdinand de Saussure. Langue is the abstract
totality of language available to a linguistic community; parole is the concrete use made of this

langue is the proper subject for linguistic

`Latin American studies 
Latin American
studies is an interdisciplinary field of research
related to the peoples, cultures, and nations of
the Americas to the south of the United States,
including the Caribbean basin. It may also
include studies related to parts of the United
States that once formed part of the Spanish
Empire, and to people from Latin America who
have migrated to the United States, Canada, and
Europe. As a field of research and a program of
study in North American, European, and Latin
American universities, it has points of intersection
and overlap with Spanish philology, Hispanic
studies, Latino/Chicano studies, Caribbean studies and Native American/indigenous studies.
In keeping with the scope of this dictionary, the
current entry emphasizes Cultural and Critical theory in Latin American studies during the
twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.
The name “Latin America” identifies regions
of the Americas that were colonized by Spain,
Portugal, and France, all countries whose languages
originated from Latin. While some scholars refer
to their area of study as “Ibero-American,” to indicate Portuguese and Spanish-speaking nations of
the Americas, or as “Spanish-American,” referring
to the Spanish-speaking societies of the Americas,
and others focus on the region of the Caribbean,
the term “Latin America” became generally
accepted by twentieth-century scholars throughout the world, largely because it is sufficiently
broad to include all of these areas. At the same

time, scholars are quick to qualify the overarching conceptual unity the term suggests in light
of the diversity of nationalities, ethnicities,
languages, as well as natural and social environments in Latin America.
While scholars from many nations contribute
to the field of Latin American studies, this article
focuses primarily on the critical and cultural
thought of Latin American intellectuals. The
body of thought that constitutes Latin American
studies has grown along two main axes, the first
addressing the question of a national or a PanLatin American cultural identity, and the second,
manifesting a concern for social justice.
At the close of the nineteenth century and
the beginning of the twentieth, the molding of
a Latin American consciousness was supported by
the cosmopolitan spirit of the Spanish American Modernists (modernistas) and the Brazilian
Parnassians and Symbolists, who established
transnational relationships among writers, in
particular, and affirmed the place of their literature within the Western tradition. The challenge,
according to these intellectuals, was to have
Latin America assume its place in a new, more
broadly constructed Western tradition. Cuban
writer José Martí, in particular, found inspiration
in Andrés Bello’s opinion, expressed a generation earlier, that Latin Americans should seek to
understand and relate to their own historical,
natural, and social environments in an original
way, without imitating European models. Martí
and other Latin American intellectuals at the turn
of the twentieth century were also concerned
that their national leaders not be unduly influenced by the example of the United States, the
emerging world power to the north.
The growing power of the United States at
the turn of the twentieth century and its willingness to exert that power in the region beyond its
southern border provided an additional incentive
for the unity of Latin American countries. While
Portugal and Spain still held colonies in America,
Brazilians and Spanish-Americans maintained
their emphasis on national independence from
European colonial domination. Once Brazil,
Cuba, and Puerto Rico were free of their colonial
yoke, the anxiety in Latin America at the rising
power of the USA, especially in Mexico, Central
America, and the Caribbean, brought a new sense

399
completed this shift away from the opposition of
America to Europe to that of opposing Western
cultures, identifying that of Latin America, and
its Iberian and classical Mediterranean heritage,
with “civilization.”
Using William Shakespeare’s The Tempest as
intertext, Rodó portrayed Latin America as the
character of Ariel, who represents humanistic
and spiritual values, in opposition to the United
States as Caliban, the symbol of non-rational
thought and the inability to rise beyond immediate and material concerns. Brazilian writer
Oswald de Andrade’s Manifesto Antropófago
(1928) (Anthropophagic Manifesto) offered a new
way of understanding the Caliban figure, with
its allusion to barbarism and anagrammatic reference to cannibalism. He suggested that Brazil
and Latin America must consume and digest
European culture in their own original way.
More recently, Cuban writer Roberto Fernández
Retamar rehabilitated the figure of Caliban as
a representative of cultural groups that had been
exploited and marginalized by a Eurocentric
America.
In the twentieth century, Latin American
societies continued the ambivalence to science
and technology that characterized the second
half of the nineteenth century. Positivist thought
was the impulse for educational and social
reforms in many Latin American countries, and
spurred the modernization of institutions and
communications throughout Latin America in
the last decades of the nineteenth century. In
the early twentieth century, certain aspects of
positivism, such as the veneration of empirical
knowledge, the links to determinism and pragmatism, and the tendency to question spiritual
values, were criticized by the Spanish-American
Modernists and the Brazilian Parnassians and
Symbolists. These writers, particularly in the
poetic genre, pursued aesthetic values that they
considered worthy in and of themselves and not
subservient to pragmatic or utilitarian concerns.
Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío, the quintessential
Spanish-American modernista, celebrated in his
Prosas profanas (1896) a refined sensibility, elite
aesthetic values, and a pursuit of formal elegance,
which inspired much of the poetry of the first
decade of the twentieth century in the Spanishspeaking nations of the Americas. The next

of transatlantic identity. The Spanish-American
nations, in particular, were open to a new relationship with Spain, and also with other “Latin”
nations such as France and Italy with whom they
shared cultural values and traditions, in contrast
with the nations and peoples originating in
Northern Europe, including the United States. This
sensibility was expressed, as well, in the works
of Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío, whose poetry
after Cantos de Vida y Esperanza (1905) exhibited
an increased identification with the Hispanic
tradition.
The multiple treatments of the binary construction of “civilization/barbarism,” dating
from classical antiquity, serve to demonstrate the
shift in tensions from East to West, or between
Europe and America, to a division between
North and South – between Anglo-Saxon
America and Latin America. The topic had been
introduced to the Americas in the sixteenth century by Bartolomé de Las Casas in his debate with
Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda regarding the Spanish
conquest of lands and cultures of the Americas.
Las Casas had argued against Sepúlveda’s view
of Native American peoples as “barbarians”
who needed to be “civilized” by Europeans. In
the mid-nineteenth century, Domingo Faustino
Sarmiento, of Argentina, reiterated this binary construction in his identification of “barbarism”
with the untamed nature of Latin America and
with the Native Americans, Africans, and mestizo
cultures which, he argued, were shaped by the
often violent forces of nature and the harshness
of rural life; he looked to Europe for assistance
with what he saw as the necessary project of
“civilizing” Latin America, which would include
for Argentina an extensive program of immigration of Europeans to the River Plate region.
At the end of the century José Martí criticized
Sarmiento’s association of civilized values with
Europe, as well as the concomitant assignation
of barbaric qualities with Latin America; he
affirmed the need for the nations of the
Americas to embrace all the races and ethnicities
within their borders, while demonstrating that
Anglo-Saxon America, particularly the United
States, was not superior to its sister nations to
the south in its treatment of peoples of African
and Native American heritage. In his book Ariel

generation of Spanish-American poets, known
for most of the century as postmodernistas (postmodernist), including Gabriela Mistral (Chile),
Ramón López Velarde (Mexico), and César
Vallejo (Peru), wrote poetry of a more personal
or testimonial nature, often dealing with social
problems, yet emphasizing their spiritual concerns.
Avant-garde poets, as well, from the second
decade of the century through the 1930s, including such figures as Vicente Huidobro (Chile),
Vallejo, and Pablo Neruda (Chile), also tended
to align themselves in opposition to positivist
thought, particularly in their exploration of
non-rational modes of thought and their nonconformity with scientific laws regarding space
and time.
In spite of the criticism of positivism in the
early twentieth century, much of the critical and
cultural thought of the first half of the twentieth
century reflected its legacy in the will to focus
attention on social problems and in the tendency
to employ empirical evidence, reasoned analysis,
and theories based in the social sciences to address
concrete problems facing a nation or region.
Following the cosmopolitan and Pan-American
sentiment around the turn of the twentieth century, there was increased concern for national
problems, particularly in the case of nations
with large sectors of the population living on
the margins of the dominant national culture. In
Peru, intellectuals in the first two decades of the
twentieth century began to focus their attention
on the many Quechua and Aymará communities
whose numbers, often did not speak Spanish,
and had long been the victims of economic
exploitation. The essays of Manuel González
Prada, the theories of Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre,
and José Carlos Mariátegui’s Siete ensayos sobre
la realidad peruana (1928) demonstrated the
legacy of positivistic thought, especially with
regard to the indigenous peoples of Peru. In
Cuba, Fernando Ortiz’s early sociological study
of Afro-Cubans in the legal system evolved into
a series of studies on Afro-Cuban culture that
helped to raise awareness about the multiple
facets of this culture and its impact on religion,
natural medicine, art, music, and literature in
Cuba. In Brazil, Gilberto Freyre produced a
similar study, based in the social sciences, of his
own multicultural nation in Casa-Grande e
Senzala (1933; The Masters and the Slaves, 1964),

one of the earliest studies with a culturalist orientation. Jean Price-Mars, a supporter of Haiti’s
Negritude movement, also wrote a study based
in the social sciences, Ainsi parla l’oncle (1928;
So Spoke the Uncle, 1983). In the wake of the
Mexican Revolution (1910–17), Minister of
Education José Vasconcelos theorized in La raza
cósmica (1925; The Cosmic Race, 1979) that
Mexico was in the vanguard of a universal process that was to create a new and superior people
through the fusion of races and ethnicities.
While Vasconcelos wrote from an anti-positivist
perspective, his belief in a superior race, albeit one
produced by racial mixture, bore a remnant of
positivism. Additionally, the novel provided an
imaginary space for the exploration of national
and regional problems from the 1920s through
mid-century in Latin America. Some of the
writers who published the most representative
novels of this period were trained as natural
or social scientists or engineers: for example,
Rómulo Gallegos (Doña Bãrbara, 1929; Dona
Barbara, 1931), Mariano Azuela (Los de abajo,
1916; The Underdogs, 1929), Jacques Roumain
(Gouverneurs de la rosée, 1944; Masters of the
Dew, 1947), and José María Arguedas (Los rios
profundos, 1958; Deep Rivers, 1978).
While the Western humanist tradition was
invoked in Latin America as an antidote to late
nineteenth-century positivism, it also served as
a broad area of encounter and dialogue between
liberal and conservative thinkers from a variety
of disciplines, including philosophy, aesthetics,
anthropology, and psychology. European philosophers and other intellectuals continued to be
sources of inspiration for Latin American intellectuals. In the period between the world wars, the
intellectual elites of Latin America shared many
of the interests and concerns of their European
counterparts, especially regarding trends in Idealism (Marburg school), new insights into subjective
experience (Henri Bergson), new dimensions
to human knowledge and perception (Edmund
Husserl’s Phenomenology), perspectivism (José
Ortega y Gasset), the validation of artistic creation
as knowledge (Benedetto Croce), and theories
related to unconscious thought (Sigmund Freud
and Carl Jung). Ortega y Gasset’s affirmation
that knowledge of a human subject must feature
an understanding of the “circumstance” of the
individual dovetailed with the concern among

401
Julio Cortázar of Argentina. Borges also manifested
a concern for “the Other” in his mature work,
including El otro, el mismo (1969; The Other, The
Same). Cortázar’s novel Rayuela (1963; Hopscotch,
1966) portrayed the existential search for meaning by an Argentine intellectual living in Paris.
Mexican writer Octavio Paz, in his work El
laberinto de la soledad (1950; The Labryinth of
Solitude, 1961) combined aspects of existentialism
with elements of Psychoanalysis and philosophical anthropology, in the sense of alienation
and otherness he attributed to each Mexican.
He argued that the Mexican’s very Alienation
and marginalization from the center of Western
civilization made him a representative of contemporary Western man. The belief in the absurdity
of modern existence, shared by avant-garde poets
and artists of the period between the two world
wars and also by existentialist writers of the post
Second-World War years, was especially manifested in Latin America Theater. This theatrical
exploration of the absurd, inspired by European
dramatists Antonin Artaud and Bertolt Brecht,
characterized the work of such writers as Jorge Diaz
and Egon Wolff of Chile, Oswaldo Dragún and
Griselda Gambaro of Argentina, and Augusto
Boal of Brasil.
The search for liberating alternatives to the
limits of chronological and historical time, was
undertaken by Latin American poets, particularly Vicente Huidobro, César Vallejo, the young
Pablo Neruda, and Oswald de Andrade in the first
half of the twentieth century. Nicolás Guillén’s
use of Afro-Cuban rhythm and phrasing in his
poetry also suggested new possibilities for exploring poetic space and time. The avant-garde
transgression of the limits of time and space was
transferred to Latin American narrative in the
second half of the century, along with narrative
techniques Latin American novelists had observed
in the works of Marcel Proust, James Joyce,
and William Faulkner. Contemporary studies
in anthropology and theories related to philosophical anthropology suggested that indigenous
peoples of Latin America and Africa had a more
promising understanding of time and space
than the more technologically advanced societies
of Europe and North America. Experimentation
with time as a concept and as a structuring
device for the narrative work was central to the
works associated with the “boom” of the Latin

Latin American studies

Latin American intellectuals for the development
of a national or pan-Latin American philosophy.
Spanish émigré José Gaos continued to develop
this idea in Mexico, and Mexican philosopher
Leopoldo Zea carried out several related studies,
including En torno a una filosofía americana (1945;
Regarding an American Philosophy). The interdisciplinary current of philosophical anthropology,
particularly of Max Scheler, which addressed the
place of human beings in the world as a broad
complex of natural, cultural, and social systems,
provided a critical space for Latin American
intellectuals to explore the identity and the place
of Americans as individuals, as nations, or as
cultures. Mexican philosopher Samuel Ramos’s
Perfil del hombre y la cultura en México (1934;
Profile of Man and Culture in Mexico) and his Hacia
un nuevo humanismo. Programa de una antropología filosófica (1940; Toward a New Humanism.
Program of a Philosophical Anthropology) served
to shift philosophical anthropology in the direction of cultural theory in their focus on Mexican
identity and culture. In Argentina, Francisco
Romero’s Teoría del hombre (1952; Theory of Man)
was a seminal work in Latin American philosophy, combining the theoretical framework of
philosophical anthropology with an exploration
of human values, another area to which Scheler
had contributed. Brazilian philosopher and jurist
Miguel Reale’s work Filosofia do direito (1953;
Philosophy of the Law) made an important
contribution to the current of philosophical
anthropology in Latin America. In his large body
of published works, Reale’s “anthropological”
interests help to define the culturalist line of
critical thought in Brazil and beyond.
The philosophies of existence provide a bridge
between the humanist and Marxist thought in
the 1950s and 1960s in Latin America. Martin
Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit (1927; Being and
Time), published in Spanish translation in 1951,
was read by some Latin American intellectuals
in the context of humanism and by others in the
context of Marxism. Jean-Paul Sartre’s theory
of existence and his later insistence that writers
and artists must commit themselves to social
and political change were also influential in Latin
America. The sense of alienation associated with
existentialism and the exploration of “otherness”
resonated with Latin American writers, particularly Jorge Luis Borges, Juan Carlos Onetti, and

Latin American studies

402
American novel and short story, including the
following: Alejo Carpentier’s Los pasos perdidos
(1953; The Lost Steps, 1956) and El reino de este
mundo (1949; The Kingdom of This World, 1957),
Julio Cortázar’s Rayuela (Hopscotch), Juan Rulfo’s
Pedro Páramo (1955; Pedro Paramo, 1959) and
La region más transparente (1958; Where the Air
Is Clear, 1960), and Cien años de soledad (1967;
One Hundred Years of Solitude, 1970) by Gabriel
García Márquez. The “fantastic” literature cultivated by Jorge Luis Borges in Ficciones (1944)
and subsequent short stories (Collected Fictions,
1998) provide prime examples of an imagination
that challenges the laws of physics and questions
human knowledge of the world.
Carpentier’s concept of lo real maravilloso (the
marvelous-real) and García Márquez’s formulation of realismo mágico (magical realism) combined
the Renaissance and utopian views of America
as a “New World” with a contemporary desire
for a natural world independent of human
will, and a time and space that escape the order
established by rational consciousness and the
laws of science. Carpentier, in particular, presented Native American culture in Los pasos
perdidos and Afro-Caribbean culture in El reino
de este mundo in opposition to European models
of consciousness. García Márquez, in Cien años
de soledad, and Brazilian writer Jorge Amado,
in Dona Flor e seus dois maridos (1966; Dona
Flor and Her Two Husbands, 1977) and other
novels, exemplify the magical realism that has
become a hallmark of Latin American literature,
extending to such later works as La casa de los
espíritus (1982; The House of Spirits, 1985) by
Isabel Allende and Como agua para chocolate
(1989; Like Water for Chocolate) by Laura
Esquivel. Octavio Paz’s poetic exploration of
Asian philosophies in Ladera este (1969; East
Side) and other works highlights alternatives
to the Western cultural tradition as well. At a
time in which Western art and architecture
celebrate a minimalist expression, the Cuban
writers José Lezama Lima and Alejo Carpentier
declared the baroque style as the most authentic
expression of Latin America. This neobaroque
style is affirmed in such works as Concierto
Barroco by Carpentier (1974; Baroque Concert),
Lezama Lima’s Paradiso (1966; Paradiso, 1974),
and Carlos Fuentes’s Terra Nostra (1975; Terra
Nostra, 1976).

Beginning in the 1960s the numerous conflicts around the world related to the Cold War
between communist and capitalist nations, including the Cuban Revolution, created increased
pressure on Latin American writers, artists, and
intellectuals to manifest their political engagement in their works. This engagement would be
multifaceted and would seek the vindication of
a wide range of groups. One of the first expressions of the need for social justice came from a
sector of the Catholic Church, the proponents
of a theology of liberation, with such figures as
Ernesto Cardenal, Gustavo Gutierrez, Juan Luis
Segundo, and Leonardo Boff. Uruguayan critic
Angel Rama advocated the study of literature
and the arts from the perspective of social and
political realities, while Peruvian philosopher
Augusto Salazar Bondy encouraged Latin American philosophers to come to terms with the fact
of the regions’s colonial past in order to create
more original philosophies in the future. Argentine
philosopher Enrique Dussel formulated his own
contribution, along with Salazar Bondy, to the
philosophy of liberation in Latin America, in
which they sought to transcend the strict opposition of the ideologies of Marxism and capitalism.
Additionally, voices from Native American and
African-American communities of Latin America
increasingly expressed their concerns for their
rights and for an end to political and cultural
oppression. The increase in the number of women
writers and in feminist theory and criticism,
beginning in the 1970s, has resulted in a further
broadening of the literary canon.
The second wave of feminism, modeled by
Rosario Castellanos, and Elena Poniatowska of
Mexico, Clarice Lispector of Brazil, Rosario
Ferré of Puerto Rico, and Cristina Peri Rossi of
Uruguay, was soon followed by representatives
of the third wave of feminism, including voices
from Native American communities and from
the African diaspora in the Americas. Among
the Native American writers, the most celebrated
is Rigoberta Menchú of Guatemala, who was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, while
African-American writers include such figures
as Nancy Morejón of Cuba, Miriam Alves of
Brazil, and Edwidge Danticat of Haiti. Scholars
have also highlighted the pioneering roles of
Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz (Mexico), Victoria
Ocampo (Argentina), Flora Tristán (Peru),

403
traditionally marginalized groups such as women,
Native Americans or indigenous, also called
original, peoples, as well as Latin Americans with
roots in Africa. The philosophy of communitarianism, with its combination of elements from
the left and the right, has been advocated by
such intellectuals as Pablo Guerra and has been
portayed in the novel Waslala by Nicaraguan
writer Gioconda Belli. Additionally, the recent
focus on trans-Atlantic studies and dialogue opens
a new dimension to Latin American studies by
fostering communication among scholars in the
Americas, Europe, and Africa.

tradition.
European and North American critical and
cultural theories featuring a less explicit political
engagement also flourished in academic and
intellectual environments in Latin America in
the last third of the twentieth century. The
Structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss was
applied to literary and cultural studies from the
1960s to the 1970s, succeeded by the semiotic
theory of Julia Kristeva. Among the poststructuralist thought, that of Michel Foucault was
the most influential, with its interdisciplinary
roots and potential for application to literature,
the arts, history, and cultural studies. While
Jacques Derrida’s theory of Deconstruction
did not have the weight in Latin America that it
did in North America, it contributed to the sense
that the construct of Western civilization, along
with human knowledge and discourses of power,
was porous and fragile. Deconstruction’s opposition to the use of the binary opposition and its
tendency towards decentralization, particularly
regarding traditional power structures, lent itself
to the feminist theories of Luce Irigaray and
Hélène Cixous, whose thought informed the
creative and critical production of Latin American writers dealing with gender issues.
With the end of the Cold War and the growing consciousness of globalization, intellectuals
in Latin America and scholars writing about
Latin America have sought points of reference and
contexts that correspond to the realities of the
twenty-first century. One of the most significant
points of reference is the colonial legacy Latin
America shares with other regions of the world,
particularly in Asia and Africa, which were colonized by Western powers in the modern age.
Critical social theory, stemming from the various
periods of the Frankfurt school, has become
more focused on theories of postcolonialism and
of subaltern peoples and cultures. John Beverly,
Nestor García Canclini, Walter Mignolo, and
Gloria Anzaldúa have applied and further developed the theories related to postcolonialism and
subaltern groups to Latin America. This broad
theoretical field provides an overarching structure for the inclusion of works by or related to

`law, philosophy of 
Currently an area of
active interdisciplinary exchange between theorists of jurisprudence and literary critics (Stanley
Fish most prominent among them) who raise
questions of legal interpretation from a broadly
Hermeneutic, neopragmatist, or Communitarian standpoint. There is also a more heterodox
school of thought by the name of Critical Legal
Studies, which draws many of its ideas from the
work of French thinkers like Jacques Derrida and
Michel Foucault. These approaches differ widely
in their political bearing and the extent to which
they take issue with the dominant (broadly liberal)
tradition of modern Anglo-American jurisprudence. What they all have in common is a turn
toward language (or to Discourse, rhetoric, and
narrative) as a means of questioning received
priorities and methodological ground rules. In the
following brief survey I shall attempt to summarize the main lines of argument and their relation
to other, more conventional forms of legal
doctrine and reasoning.
From the received viewpoint jurisprudence
is chiefly concerned with establishing adequate
grounds or procedures for the adjudication of
particular cases with reference to existing statutes,
principles, legal provisions, or case law precedents.
For the most part – it is assumed – this process
will be fairly straightforward. That is to say, a direct
appeal is made to some relevant or appropriate
item of law which can be shown to fit the case in
hand, or to provide for such cases by virtue of
its scope as a generalized or covering principle.
Of course there is still room for disagreement over
just how those principles or precedents apply,
and also – more controversially – over whether
there exists a neutral adjudicative standpoint for
determining their relevance or applicability in
any given instance. Traditionally, legal theorists
have drawn a distinction between, on the one
hand, clear-cut cases for which there exists some
adequate statutory provision, or which can readily be brought under some prior ruling, and on
the other hand those “hard cases” where problems arise – and where judges may find themselves

creating legal precedent – for lack of any firm or
explicit procedural guidelines.
A similar distinction is held to obtain between
the realms of statute law and case law. Thus
the former has at least the appearance of being
couched in plain, unambiguous terms, or of
providing in advance all the necessary means –
precepts, principles, statements of intent, limiting clauses, and so forth – by which to determine
their legitimate scope and precise meaning in
this or that context. Case law, conversely, always
has an interpretative element, a point at which
judgment must be exercised with regard to the
relevance of past proceedings, their import for
the case in hand, and the extent to which they
offer guidance in arriving at a just and equitable
verdict. Here it cannot be a matter of adopting some generalized covering-law precept (or
match between case and case), such that the result
would follow directly from a (quasi)-algorithmic
application or a straightforward decisionprocedure. Rather, it requires that each instance
be interpreted in light of the manifold details,
circumstances, motives, and other individuating features which complicate the comparison
between them.
Both of these distinctions have lately come
under attack from theorists in the Critical Legal
Studies camp and from others who seek to
deconstruct or challenge the instituted order of
juridical discourse. Thus it is argued that statute
law (no less than case law) always entails a large
measure of interpretative license; that its scope
and provisions cannot be simply read off from
the sacrosanct “words on the page”; and hence
that any talk of due process, the separation of
powers between executive and judicial branches,
of neutral (unbiased) application, and so forth,
is merely a disguise for some covert political
agenda that dares not speak its name. And in
case law, so it is argued, we should likewise be
suspicious of the distinction between “easy” (or
straightforward) and “hard” cases, since this also
very often obscures the extent to which seemingly
self-evident, rule-governed, or “commonsense”
modes of judgment may conceal all manner of
ideological prejudice. Such ideas have a longer
prehistory of active debate in the US than in the
British legal system.
These questions were first raised in a programmatic way by the American legal realist school of

405
good by acknowledging the range of its own
(past and present) social applications, and the
impossibility of rising above them to some
vantage point of absolute justice or truth. Thus
Ronald Dworkin argues for a narrative conception of legal and judicial history wherein judges,
lawyers, students, theorists, concerned lay-persons,
and others can view themselves on the analogy
with a “chain novelist,” one who takes up the
story at a certain point in its development and
continues it with the aim of both conserving
narrative coherence and responding creatively
to new and unforeseen challenges. This would
be a principled but also (in the good sense) a pragmatic endeavor. It would seek to promote the
flourishing of social-democratic institutions and
the enlargement of a genuine participant public
sphere.
For others on the left-libertarian wing of
Critical Legal Studies such arguments amount
to nothing more than a species of high-toned
apologetic pleading for the current status quo.
To their way of thinking this “liberal” discourse
is shot through with various contradictions,
Aporias, and instances of sheer hypocrisy or bad
faith which can best be exposed by a sedulous
attention to its blind spots of ingrained prejudice.
In short, there is no alternative but to question
every last method, precept, and principle of what
is nowadays regarded – on a broad consensus
of qualified legal opinion – as just or equitable
practice. In its cruder, more reductive variant
this doctrine amounts to an exercise of wholesale
“trashing,” that is, taking the pronouncements of
various legal or judicial authorities and showing
how they always self-deconstruct into forms of
manifest non sequitur, performative contradiction, illicit passages from fact to value, concealed
judgmental priorities, etc. Although deriving
avowedly from the work of deconstructionists
like Jacques Derrida and Paul De Man, these
writings all too often display nothing like the
same degree of closely forcused exegetical rigor
or alertness to localized complexities of logic,
grammar, and rhetoric. They are also prone
to undermine their own case – in the familiar
relativist fashion – by blocking any recourse to
normative values or principles (of justice, equity,
due process, etc.), against which to measure
existing abuses of juridical authority. As with
Foucault, there comes a point at which skepticism

law, philosophy of

the 1930s and 1940s. Their thinking was much
influenced by Marxist and left-sociological analyses, as well as by wider demographic factors
and the sense of a looming crisis in domestic and
world economic and political affairs. Where the
current theorists differ is chiefly in their looking
to a range of alternative sources – Poststructuralism, Postmodernism, Deconstruction,
Discourse theory, Foucauldian “Genealogy,” etc.
– as a substitute for those older, unfashionable
modes of sociopolitical critique. Thus the talk is
now more often of law as the site of conflicting
Textual or narrative strategies, of multiple and
heterogeneous “subject positions” within language, or of the way that legal discourse secures
its authority by assuming a “metalinguistic”
stance supposedly above and beyond the level
of first-order natural narrative pragmatics. (See
the entry on Jean-François Lyotard for one
influential source of this line of argument.) Such
has been the widespread “linguistic turn” across
various present-day disciplines, jurisprudence
latterly among them. Its effect is most visible in
the oft-repeated claim that “reality” is itself a
discursive construct, a purely notional ground
of appeal which will always be contested – like
the “facts” or the “evidence” in any given case –
from a range of competing (incommensurable)
viewpoints. Hence Lyotard’s postmodernist idea
of justice as a matter of maximizing narrative
differentials, judging so far as possible “without
criteria,” and refusing to privilege any one “phrase
genre” (for example, the cognitive) above all the
rest. For otherwise, he argues, we risk the kind
of “totalitarian” gesture that will seek to suppress the narrative “differend” between various
phrases-in-dispute, and will thereby commit a
juridical wrong against one or other (or maybe
both) parties.
This argument is pursued to various, more
or less radical ends, according to the theorist’s
political persuasion and the degree of his or her
avowed disenchantment with the discourse of
mainstream (whether “conservative” or “liberal”)
jurisprudence. For some – for example, the
liberal communitarians – what is most important
is to keep open the ongoing pluralist cultural
conversation, and prevent any abstract creeds,
theories, or principles from seeking to monopolize the moral high ground. In their view
jurisprudence can best promote this common

law, philosophy of

406
leans over into a downright cynical conviction
that all claims-to-truth or statements of principle partake of a ubiquitous will-to-power that
can only be resisted by opting for a strain of
hard-boiled, blanket, antinomian rhetoric.
Elsewhere the critical insights of deconstruction are deployed to much subtler effect. Thus,
for instance, it may be shown how contract law
gives rise to aporias – or moments of undecidability – when it attempts to articulate a working distinction between the public and private
domains. Or again, it may be argued with reference to the statute/case law dichotomy that this
rests on an implicit axiomatics of language, one
which in turn presupposes the existence of a
clear-cut demarcation between constative and
performative orders of utterance, and which
thus runs up against those problems analyzed
in Derrida’s deconstructive reading of speechact philosophy. Similar arguments have been
advanced with regard to issues of corporate
responsibility, of positive discrimination in
various (for example, professional or academic)
contexts, and of free speech vis-à-vis the interests
of public peace or anti-racist legislation. Some
of the most interesting work in this field deals with
issues of contract law and the extent to which contractual obligations remain legally (or morally)
binding when due account is taken of the different contexts – or the range of circumstantial
factors – that bear upon the parties concerned.
In each of these cases, and others besides, the
aim is not merely to “trash” legal precedent in
a spirit of iconoclastic zeal, but also to bring out
those stress points where the discourse of law contravenes its own principles or generates specific
conflicts of motive and intent.
Indeed, this question of “framer’s intention” –
or the “spirit” as opposed to the “letter” of the
text – is one that has given rise to much debate,
especially as regards the founding articles of US
constitutional law. Commentators divide sharply
on the issue of how far it is possible to define
or respect those intentions, given all the farreaching social, political, and cultural changes
that have occurred since the articles in question
were first set down. Thus for some it appears quite
pointless to raise such questions, since (i) there
is no means of knowing for sure what the framers
had in mind, apart from what they actually (and
often ambiguously) wrote; and (ii) they were of

course in no position to anticipate what kinds
of construction might in future be placed upon
their words by judges, legislators, or social policy
makers with very different evaluative priorities.
After all, one consequence of “respecting” their
(presumed) original intentions would be to
uphold the institution of slavery, or to treat
slaves (and women) as falling outside the otherwise “universal” realm of human democratic
rights and freedoms. Such a viewpoint would
nowadays find few advocates even among the
most conservative commentators. Nevertheless,
there still remains the question of just what
kinds or degree of hermeneutic license may be
warranted by the appeal to contemporary ideas
of social and political justice. And here – once
again – there is much scope for disagreement
between, on the one hand, those who would
recommend that we abandon all thought of
respecting the framers’ intent, and on the other
hand those who defend such an attitude so long
as it carries the saving clause: “what the framers
would have meant by their chosen form of words
had they been living at the present time and
cherished the same (broadly democratic) aims,
values, and ideals.”
This “constructivist” position does seem to
capture the best, most intuitively adequate sense
of what is required in the constant process of
adjustment between the letter of a written constitution and its “spirit” as construed in light
of present-day values and concerns. It also has
much in common with Dworkin’s liberal conception of law as an ongoing chain narrative – or
open-ended dialogue – where issues of principle
are closely bound up with the shared aspirations
and communal self-images of the age. However,
this leaves room for the skeptic to ask why
certain principles (and not others) are deemed
worthy of admission to the dialogue, or again, why
the liberal consensus – thus defined – should
exclude certain voices as beyond the pale of
civilized juridical discourse. This liberal-pluralist
ethos may always turn out to have sharp limits
of tolerance when confronted with a challenge –
like that of the Critical Legal Studies movement
– which declines to play by the current (consensusbased) rules of the game. And indeed it is
hard to see how the skeptic’s charge could be
answered from a liberal-communitarian standpoint, or in terms of the appeal to currently

407
honorific terms – “reason,” “principle,” “justice,”
“equality,” “progress,” “democracy,” and so forth
– which may occupy the high ground of cultural
debate at some given time. Not that one can pick
and choose at random among them, or choose
to deploy some wholly different rhetoric without
the least regard for existing conventions. This
would be to place oneself outside that relevant
community, and thus pass up any chance of
gaining a respectful or serious hearing. Nevertheless, Fish argues, they should still be seen at
bottom as just rhetorical gambits, designed to win
credence among those whose opinions count,
and who thus constitute the target “community”
for those who hope (say) to influence the course
of debate, to gain academic tenure, or to persuade
a judge or jury to their way of thinking. Beyond
that, there is nothing more substantive at issue
– nothing deeper, more “principled,” or consequential – than the choice between this or that
rhetoric or language game on wholly pragmatic
grounds.
These arguments of Fish have been taken up
by a school of neopragmatist literary and legal
theorists who (in a somewhat pyrrhic gesture)
declare themselves intransigently “against theory.”
Their point, once again, is that nothing is
affected by the move to a high-toned discourse
of “reason” or “principle” (or, for that matter, a
critical discourse of “ideology,” “contradiction,”
“aporia,” etc.), since these terms merely serve to
signal the user’s allegiance to some existing –
whether mainstream or dissident – interpretative
community. Thus on the one hand there are
“positive” theorists, among them liberals like
Dworkin, who adopt a rhetoric of “law as principle” in the mistaken conviction that such talk
can provide a philosophical or ethical backup for
their preexistent habits of belief. On the other there
are those – “negative” thinkers of various stripe,
among them deconstructors, feminists, advocates
of the law-and-society approach, or the Critical
Legal Studies movement – who, whatever their
differences of “theory” or “principle,” subscribe
to the same delusory idea that beliefs can be
changed (in this case subverted) by an exercise
of independent or critical thought. On the issue
of “framer’s intention” likewise there is nothing
to choose (bar the rhetoric) between theorists who
bring up all manner of arguments in defense of
a “strong” constructivist position and skeptical

law, philosophy of

prevailing values and beliefs as the ultimate
criteria of what should count as a legitimate
contribution to debate.
It is the same problem that often crops up with
those forms of anti-foundationalist doctrine –
in epistemology and Ethics alike – which deny
all recourse to grounds or principles beyond
the currency of in-place consensus belief. This
opens the way to a relativist outlook that can offer
no reasoned argument (apart from local custom,
pragmatic inclination, or ingrained cultural
habit) for regarding some beliefs as well founded
or just and others as lacking any such claim to
good faith and rational assent. Therefore it follows that the skeptic will always win in debate
with the liberal communitarian, since the latter
can provide nothing more convincing by way
of principled justification than a conventionalist
(for example, Wittgensteinian) appeal to language games, narratives, cultural “forms of life,”
or the way we just happen to do things in our
cultural neck of the woods. And then it is plain
sailing for the skeptic to protest – by a simple tu
quoque riposte – that her or his viewpoint is
unrepresented in this cosy pluralist orthodoxy.
Nobody has exploited this rhetorical turn
to more ingenious knock-down effect than the
literary critic Stanley Fish. Indeed “literary
critic” is really a misnomer in Fish’s case since
he has lately moved out from that narrow disciplinary base into various other fields, among
them jurisprudence, ethics, philosophy of mind
and language, cultural history, and sociology
of knowledge. That Fish currently holds a joint
appointment in English and law at Duke University is one indication of his wish to break
down those traditional (and, in his view, quite
arbitrary or culture-specific) divisions of intellectual labor. His argument, briefly summarized,
is that all these disciplines (or pseudo-disciplines)
in the end come down to what is currently and
contingently “good in the way of belief” That
is to say, it is only with reference to some given
“Interpretive community” – whether cultural,
linguistic, professional, academic, or whatever –
that we can offer some account of their rising or
declining fortunes. Truth just is what it is taken
to be according to the values that happen to
prevail within some such (more or less broadly
defined) “community” of like-minded thinkers.
And the same goes for all those other purely

law, philosophy of

408
debunkers who subject such claims to all the
standard anti-intentionalist lines of attack.
In Fish’s view it is a similar (and equally
futile) debate that divides literary critics. Thus the
issue is joined between defenders of a conservative approach, such as E.D. Hirsch, who think to
establish adequate grounds (as well as an ethical
imperative) in support of their case for respecting the author’s intention, and opponents who
declare that such a project is neither feasible nor
(indeed) desirable. However, according to Fish
and his disciples in the “against-theory” camp,
both parties are equally naive in supposing that
it makes any difference what they happen to
think as a matter of theory or principle. It is
simply the case that when we read a text – or
construe an article of law – we are always (necessarily) imputing some intention which allows us
to treat it as meaningful discourse, rather than
a jumble of letters (or marks) quite devoid of
intelligible sense. Not that this should give any
comfort to Hirsch or the advocates of framers’
intent. On the contrary, it denies that we could
ever have grounds – theoretical or principled
grounds – for choosing between rival “intentionalist” accounts, or coming up with some
method, hermeneutic theory, decision procedure
or whatever to point understanding in the right
direction. For there is just no way that theory
(“positive” or “negative”) can affect such issues
of interpretative choice. Rather, it is always a
question of adopting any theory – or, in Fish’s
preferred idiom, any line of available “theory
talk” – which happens to suit our present argumentative purposes or our sense of what will
work best in terms of suasive strategy.
Thus theorizing is a wholly inconsequential
activity, one that can never effect the least change
in our own (or other people’s) existing habits of
belief. Of course there are uses (rhetorical uses)
for “theory talk,” for instance, when one seeks to
impress colleagues, to be published in the right
journals, or produce some clincher in seminar
or conference debate. Nevertheless, to the extent
that such strategies work, one will always be
addressing an “interpretative community,” at
least some of whose members already subscribe
to one’s own theoretical line, and all of whom will
share enough points of reference – professional,
academic, cultural, etc. – to prevent any breakdown of communication. In short, one will

either be preaching to the (wholly or halfway)
converted, or, in the exceptional case, saying
something so radically new and strange that
one’s theory talk will fall upon deaf ears and thus
fail in its purpose. From which Fish concludes:
(i)

that such talk is just a species of suasive
rhetoric;
(ii) that “theory” drops out in all but name;
(iii) that belief goes “all the way down” and
cannot be dislodged except by some other
(rhetorically more efficacious) belief; and
(iv) that such shifts come about only in
response to a change in the prevailing
climate of opinion as registered by a given
(broad-based or specialized) “interpretative community.” Moreover
(v) this is nothing to worry about since we can
perfectly well carry on arguing, disagreeing,
criticizing, giving “reasons,” adopting a
“principled” stance and so forth in just
the same way as before, but now, thanks
to Fish, with no illusions concerning the
truth of our beliefs or their justice as
defined by some absolute (non-culturespecific) set of criteria.
If theory is an inconsequential activity then so
is its abandonment or our ceasing to place any
credence in its stronger (that is, consequentialist)
claims. And in any case, as Fish mock-ruefully
concedes, it is unlikely that any mere argument
“against theory” will have the least effect on
our habits of theory talk so long as such talk
continues to enjoy some measure of communal
esteem. Nor should it, indeed, given Fish’s own
belief that quite simply nothing follows, in theory
or in practice, from our accepting or rejecting his
case against theory.
All the same, it is clear that his argument does
have some large (and disabling) consequences
for those various disciplines – jurisprudence
among them – which continue to invoke just
the kinds of distinction that Fish would dismiss
out of hand. If he is right (whatever that could
mean), then we should have to conclude that
their practitioners had always been laboring
under a massive delusion whenever they thought
to find reason or justification for rejecting some
ideas as erroneous, misguided, unprincipled, or
ethically repugnant, and endorsing others despite

409
to particular (well-documented) cases of judicial
bias, abuse of corporate power, anti-union legislation, and pretenses of neutral adjudicative treatment in issues of (for example) private capital
venture versus state welfare or local authority
provision.
His work seems to me a model of its kind in
both these respects. That is, it rejects the kind of
leveling or all-purpose deconstructive gambit,
the treatment of law as nothing more than a
species of rhetorical imposture, which will always
be open to Fish’s line of shrewdly debunking the
tu quoque response. Goodrich follows de Man and
Derrida in locating those specific aporias (or
tensions between logic, grammar, and rhetoric)
that mark the stress points in legal discourse.
These in turn give a hold for some cogent criticism of the interests, economic and sociopolitical,
that often emerge at just those points to disturb
the appearance of a neutral, even-handed dispensation of justice. However, such arguments
can have no force if applied in a blanket (quasideconstructive) manner which takes for granted
the collapse of all operative distinctions between
truth and falsehood, principle and prejudice,
or the values of communal justice and those of
some partisan “interpretative community.” This
has been especially so at times like the 1990s
when the British legal system has been subject to
some 15 years of steadily increasing right-wing
political pressure and miscarriages of justice at
every level, from police frame-ups to rigged
appeal-court procedures and judicial connivance
at government malpractice. Indeed this situation
has all the makings of a full-scale legitimation
crisis, were it not for the prevailing cynical
wisdom that expects nothing better and on
balance prefers to stick with the devil it knows.
It is the same attitude, in inverted form, which
responds by “trashing” legal institutions or by
rejecting all talk of reason, justice, and principle
as so much naive or self-serving liberal rhetoric.
However, this is just one (albeit rather prominent)
example of the current interdisciplinary exchange
between philosophy of law and what has come to
be known – mainly in departments of literature
– under the capacious cover-term “theory.” That
these developments have another, more critical
and progressive aspect may be judged from the
virulent attacks heaped upon them by conservative defenders of old corruption in the name

law, philosophy of

and against the currency of established values
and beliefs. Such an interpretation would apply
right across the disciplinary board, from philosophy of science to epistemology, ethics, political
theory, social anthropology, and (of course)
literary criticism. This is where Fish started out
and where relativist doctrines – in a range of
geared-up (postmodern or poststructuralist) forms
– have pretty much conquered the field. Hence,
as I have said, the frequent allusions to literary
theory that have become almost de rigueur for
legal theorists with an eye to the high ground of
cultural and intellectual fashion. Hence also the
ease with which an adept like Fish can run rings
around those “positive” or “negative” theorists,
liberal communitarians or dissidents in the
Critical Legal Studies camp, who adopt a halfway
relativist stance, one that stops short at their
own favored range of values and beliefs.
However, I should not want to suggest that
nothing useful or progressive has emerged from
these recent developments in philosophy of law.
Nor is it true that Critical Legal Studies can
justifiably be treated as a school or movement subscribing to any fixed (however heterodox) set of
doctrines. If the “trashing” approach falls plump
into Fish’s sights as an instance of unwitting
rhetorical self-subversion, then there are many
other examples, some of which I have mentioned
above, where these theorists offer a meticulous
deconstructive close-reading of statute law or
case law texts with profound implications for the
conduct of juridical debate. That the issues have
become so sharply polarized in the United States
is no doubt owing to a number of distinctive
historical and cultural factors. These include the
existence of a founding charter whose articles
are open to varied (for example, “conservative”
and “liberal”) constructions; the role played by
judicial review as a matter of widespread public
concern; and the power exercised by Supreme
Court justices to overturn even the most seemingly well-entrenched programs of state legislature.
In Britain these debates enjoy nothing like the
same degree of public visibility. This is perhaps
one reason why the work produced by critical legal
scholars in this country, Peter Goodrich among
them, has adopted a rather different focus. Thus
Goodrich addresses himself on the one hand
to rather specialized issues in rhetorical theory
vis-à-vis the discourse of law, and on the other

Le Corbusier

of tradition or “commonsense” values. Here at least
jurisprudence has something to learn from the
intensive theorizing among literary and cultural
critics since the mid-1970s. One lesson is precisely
to avoid that path toward a simplified leveling
of genre distinctions, among them the distinction
between law and literature, which ends up (like
Fish) by assimilating every kind of discourse to
the realm of rhetoric, fiction, or what is currently “good in the way of belief.”

`Le Corbusier 
(Charles-Edouard Jeanneret)
(1887–1965) Swiss-born French architect. Le
Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe are
almost exact contemporaries, and the architecture of Le Corbusier and that of Mies follow
closely related paths to meet at a very similar
stylistic point at almost exactly the same time. Both
Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoie, Poissey, 1929–31,
and Mies’s German Pavilion for the International Exposition, Barcelona, 1929, have become

indispensable examples of the design and aesthetic
which emphasizes technical perfection and which
has come to be called the International style.
After this momentary meeting in the history of
architecture, their work moves on in contrary
directions to arrive in the 1950s in very different places. Mies’s Seagram Building, New York,
1958, shares the same concerns with precise
proportioning and the subtle play of color and
texture as his Pavilion, but Le Corbusier’s Notre
Dame du Haut, Ronchamp, 1950–5, with its
thick and rough textured walls, irregular size and
placement of openings, the Brancusiesque roof,
seems very unlike his Villa. Seeing the architectural
distance that comes to separate Mies’s corporate
office tower from Le Corbusier’s chapel, and
then looking back on the Villa Savoie and the
German Pavilion, the two separate directions
Mies’s and Le Corbusier’s work will take after
1930 appear to be already charted. Mies’s
impeccable Pavilion seems turned inward to be
found in concentrated form in the fine detailing of the “Barcelona” furniture of its interior;
Le Corbusier’s elevated Villa turns outward and
upward to reach a climax in the freeform sculptural windscreen on the rooftop solarium. The path
followed by Mies is like the narrow one seen
in the paintings of Mondrian – the continued
refinement and condensation of a purist vocabulary; the path taken by Le Corbusier is more like
the broad one found in the work of Picasso –
the continuing exploration and expression of a
personal vision. While Mies seems at his best
creating the isolated monument for a single
individual (for example, the Farnsworth House,
Plano, Illinois, 1946–50), Le Corbusier embraces
the challenge of designing building complexes
for large numbers of people (for example, ideal
cities like the Ville Radieuse, 1930–9, high-density
housing such as Unité d’Habitation, Marseilles,
1947–52, and the new capital at Chandigarh,
India, 1951–6). The different paths taken by
Mies and Le Corbusier may be summarized in
the following two images: first, Mies measuring
with calipers the spaces between the travertine
blocks in the terrace of the Farnsworth House to
make sure they are perfectly placed; and second,
Le Corbusier surveying Rio de Janeiro from an
airplane and envisaging a viaduct megastructure
built in a line along the coast between the ocean
and the mountains. It may be that the two

`Leavis, Frank Raymond (1895–1978)
British literary critic. In his teaching at Cambridge and in the journal Scrutiny (1932–53),
Leavis was a major participant in English debates
on Culture, defending a high literary model of
the cultural “center” against threats from science
and mass culture. He revised, and severely
restricted, the Canon of English literature in
Revaluation (1936) and The Great Tradition
(1948), employing a strong form of Moral
criticism partly inherited from Arnold. His
general cultural criticism lamented the destruction of the English rural “organic community,”
whose values survived only in the literary tradition. Despite affiliations with the modernism of
Eliot, he continued the Romantic anti-capitalist
line of cultural critique from Carlyle and Ruskin
and mediated through Lawrence, showing relentless Protestant hostility to cultural bureaucracies
and institutions (the BBC, Oxford University, the
London literary journals), and a zealous belief
in literature’s “life-enhancing” value. Drawing
on the work of his wife Q.D. Leavis (1906–81)
in her Fiction and the Reading Public (1932), and
on Eliot’s Dissociation of sensibility thesis,
Leavis outlined a historical sociology of English
culture as decline and disintegration, in Mass
Civilization and Minority Culture (1933) and later
works. In this model, the shared national culture
and vibrant language of Shakespeare’s time has
broken down, under pressures from popular
education and journalism, into a sterile “high”
culture (for example, Joyce, Woolf, Auden) and
a mindless “low” culture of cinema and pulp
fiction. Leavis’s disciples (“Leavisites”) were an

influential force in British education in the 1950s
and 1960s, and some introduced the (morally
dismissive) study of advertising into their classrooms. Since the critiques of his nostalgic conservatism by Raymond Williams and others, Leavis
is now regarded (despite his anti-establishment
polemics) as a reactionary force in English literary
studies, usually because of his anti-theoretical
stance and his defense of a tightly exclusive
canon.

`legitimation 
A central term of Max Weber’s
political sociology, denoting the process of claiming legitimacy: a recognition on the part of the
governed of the right of those who govern to
rule over them (Weber, 1922b). States may be
classified according to the different principles
of legitimacy to which they lay claim. As a
description of the role of ideas in the acquisition
and maintenance of political power, the idea
of legitimation may be compared to the Marxist
concept of Ideology, although it attributes
greater independence to the normative dimension
of political life. It was integrated into a neoMarxist theory of the state by Habermas (1975).
The concept gained preeminence in the late
1970s in the course of a debate over whether or
not the New right attack on welfare provision
would delegitimize the liberal capitalist state.

practices that oppress women for whom sexual
and emotional relationships with other women are
primary. The starting point for the history of lesbian feminism is the reorganization of Gender
Ideology at the turn of the twentieth century that
simultaneously created and demonized lesbianism
as a sexual identity. Before that reorganization
certain sexual practices were considered gay, but
anyone might engage in them; today gays are
considered a class of persons and homosexuality
a sexual identity.
The beginning of the gay liberation movement
is usually marked by the Stonewall riot of 1968,
when gays refused to be arrested by New York City
police during a raid on a gay bar, but numerous
homophile organizations of the 1950s, such as
the Daughters of Bilitis, provided a grass-roots
organization of lesbians from which the lesbian
feminism of the 1960s emerged. After Stonewall,
a flood of openly self-identified lesbians joined
feminist organizations such as the National
Organization of Women, founded in 1966,
forcing feminist theory and political practice far
beyond its liberal roots toward a radical reinterpretation of heterosexuality as the bulwark of
Patriarchy. Lesbians such as Charlotte Bunch,
Ti-Grace Atkinson, and Adrienne Rich theorized
that heterosexuality was not merely a sexual
“identity” – and certainly not the only “natural”
or “normal” one – but a compulsory social
system, an institution as well as an ideology
that oppressed all women. The radicals’ slogan
was “feminism is the theory – lesbianism is the
practice.”
By 1971 the lesbian feminist presence in
hitherto liberal feminist organizations became so
vocal as to alarm the heterosexual constituency.
Betty Friedan’s was a prominent voice arguing
that although lesbians were welcome in feminist organizations, they should remain “closeted”
so as not to provoke a vilification that would
undermine the movement. In the “gay/straight
split” that ensued, lesbian feminists entered a
separatist stage; throughout the 1970s they would
work to create alternative communities and
social structures in which the power of “womanidentified women” could be released. The AIDS
crisis beginning in the 1980s inspired a resurgence
of homophobia in the dominant culture so
mighty that when the Moral Majority called for
the incarceration and execution of gays there

was little if any public outcry. In response, many
lesbian feminists joined efforts with gay men,
reactivating the old homophile alliance between
gay men and lesbian women eschewed in the
separatist 1970s.
Now lesbian feminists are widely distributed
throughout the political spectrum: they work in
all factions of the feminist movement, which has
generally repudiated its homophobic position of
the early 1970s, in separatist communities and
organizations, and in organizations working for
gays’ rights generally. By the 1990s there was
considerable academic attention to every aspect
of gay and lesbian history and experience. The
Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader (Abelove et al.,
1993) not only collects an extensive number of
important essays in gay and lesbian cultural
studies, but provides extensive “Suggestions for
Further Reading” on all aspects of this topic.

`Lévi-Strauss, Claude (1908–2009) 
French
anthropologist. It is not often that an anthropologist achieves such stature that he is described
as a hero. Claude Lévi-Strauss did so (viz. Claude
Lévi-Strauss: The Anthropologist as Hero, edited
by E. and T. Hayes, 1970). Lévi-Strauss, whose
writings span the half century following the
1939–45 war, was the central anchorage of what
is known as structural anthropology or French
Structuralism. The approach is distinctive,
complex, fruitful, has many practitioners, and
achieves in all respects the status of a school of
thought. Remarkably, Lévi-Strauss’s writings not
only originated the school, but, 50 years later, were
still at its cutting edge.
Lévi-Strauss identifies his most important
intellectual forebear as Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
In Rousseau’s writings he found the central
tenet of his own work: that accounting for the
transition from animal to human, from a state of
nature to a state of Culture, was the central problemin the study of human beings. Other major
mentors for Lévi-Strauss are Emile Durkheim
and his student Marcel Mauss. From Durkheim

413
two English phonemes. The technique succeeds
because phonemes are organized in contrastive,
paired relationships called Binary oppositions.
They have to be, says Lévi-Strauss, because the
neurology of the human brain operates in binary
pairs.
For Lévi-Strauss cultural systems too are built
on a fairly small number of meaning units –
Symbols – that can be identified by using the
contrastive pair technique. The complication is
that the meaning of symbols is often disguised.
Symbols can be reversed (Transformations)
or otherwise changed in a number of ways.
Unraveling them requires the extremely meticulous examination of ethnographic data, much of
which will not be what it seems. Success yields
an inverted pyramid that begins with the surface
ethnography and proceeds downward through
a series of decoded contrastive pairs representing symbolic expressions of oppositional choices
around which the cultural system is built. As
with language, cultural systems are means of
transmitting and receiving.
The two major domains to which Lévi-Strauss
devoted most of his efforts are kinship and
myth. Within kinship he focuses on marriage
rules, and in an elegant analysis of a widespread
but puzzling custom, the preference that spouses
should be first cousins, he concludes that, owing
to these rules, male-administered kin groups
(clans) are locked into reciprocal relationships.
What is transmitted between them are women;
clans give away daughters and receive wives in
return. The second domain is mythology. In a
four-volume series that is probably his magnum
opus, Mythologies (1964, 1966, 1968, 1973), LéviStrauss examines hundreds of indigenous myths,
leading the reader through oppositional analyses
to reveal their underlying systems.
The empiricist traditions in anthropology,
especially in Britain and the United States, have
resisted French structuralism. The criticisms
chiefly target the impossibility of independently
verifying the decoded structure. Lévi-Strauss
energetically rejoinders that Empiricism itself is
a matter of successive approximations, of dialectical debate and replacement, and that structuralist
findings are only similar (see Sholte, 1973,
pp. 683–7 for further discussion).
Claude Lévi-Strauss was one of the giants of
contemporary thought. The above is no more than

Lévi-Strauss, Claude

Lévi-Strauss takes several propositions. He is antireductionist: social behavior cannot be reduced
to psychology or physics or biology. Social behavior originates in coherent, logical systems whose
configurations are elusive, but discoverable with
meticulous comparative work. An individual’s
own volition is inconsequential; individuals are
modeled on the social systems in which they live;
to explain behavior, look to the social system. With
Mauss he shares the conviction that the study
of small, traditional societies will provide a rich
harvest of comparative cases, avoiding the complexities and distortions that come with civilizations. Further, the foundation of being human is
reciprocity, the sense of obligation that comes from
giving and receiving. Reciprocity underlies all
human society, distinguishes it from all animal
interaction, and creates a social system based on
exchange. Finally, Lévi-Strauss embraces the
notion from both Durkheim and Mauss that
some domains of human custom are “total”;
that is, they conjoin several subsystems of the
whole at once. These domains are priority targets
of investigation if one seeks to discern the
underlying system that organizes a society. The
two cultural domains with which Lévi-Strauss
has mostly worked, kinships and mythologies,
have this “total” quality.
To these propositions Lévi-Strauss adds his
own. Lévi-Strauss argues that the structure of a
social system is unconscious to all participants and
is never plainly in view. The key to discovering
it is to be found in the science of linguistics,
and this is because, Lévi-Strauss argues, both
language and cultural systems are built on the
same principles. There is a reason for this: both
are lodged in the human brain and necessarily
reflect its neurological organization. Thus both
language and culture use a quite small number
of components which, with the application of
limited number of principles, generate the vast
richness of language and culture respectively.
In language the basal components are phonemes, the smallest standardized sounds that
convey meaning. The way linguists identify phonemes is by a technique known as contrastive
pairs. Thus in English “pin” and “bin” convey
different meanings, and yet the only difference
in the sound units is between the “p” sound and
the “b” sound. Because substituting one for the
other changes the meaning, the “p” and “b” are

an extract from the vast corpus of sophisticated,
erudite scholarship and commentary that he
produced over more than half a century. His
analysis and findings have stimulated and guided
scholars in many fields, especially philosophy
and the literary humanities. French structuralism
achieved its greatest saliency in the 1960s and the
1970s. Outside France it has since receded in the
face of new scholarly enthusiasms. None the less,
in accounting for mythic symbolism, no new
approach has yet displaced French structuralism
concerning underlying symbolic meanings or the
systemic relationship they may bear to each other.

The author of the article on liberalism
in the Encyclopedia Britannica (1993) traces
liberal values back to the pre-Socratic philosophers
and the Bible, where are found “a sense of the
importance of human individuality, a liberation
of the individual from complete subservience to
the group, and a relaxation of the tight hold
of custom, law, and authority” (p. 422). Richard
Hofstadter (1955) describes the liberal tradition
in the United States as “popular, democratic,
progressive” (p. 13).
The following principles derive from a credo
put forward by David Spitz and based upon the
perspective of John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty:
(i)

(ii)

(iii)

Liberty. Because freedom of inquiry and
discussion is essential to the correction
of unjust inequalities, and because people
disagree over the nature of justice, freedom
possesses greater value than equality or
justice.
Privacy is necessary to thought for
inquiry and discussion and for discovering one’s individuality.
Property. People precede and transcend
property in value, but property has a

positive role in promoting human wellbeing by empowering individuals against
government, corporations, and majority
opinion.
(iv) However, in so far as the sovereignty of
property is employed contrary to the
public good, it must be contained.
(v)
Utility. The test is social utility, for rights
adhere to human beings, not institutions.
(vi) Power. Because power tends to corrupt,
surrounding its possessor with toadies
who fill him or her with illusions of selfimportance and inhibit alternative ideas
and actions, we should distrust power
and authority.
(vii) Toleration. Because only the gods know
with certainty, acknowledgement of
one’s limitations implies acceptance of
the limitations of others, which leads to
open discussion for discovering truth and
remedying social ills.
(viii) Democracy. The advantages of individual
liberty suggest the beneficence of democratic polity, since free discussion and
examination of evidence and provision
for error are more likely to yield value than
any form of absolutism.
(ix) Truth and Rationality. Individual liberty,
democracy, and informed debate are
the foundations of the rational pursuit of
truth.
(x)
Change and Reform. Because everything
changes, rational people are prepared to
accept change, to understand it, and to
direct it slowly for the benefit of society.
Reform conduces to individual freedom
in a democratic process of dealing with
change.
(xi) Revolution. In contrast, the violence of
revolution disrupts inquiry and debate
so essential to individuality and democracy and leads to aggrandizing power
and authority.
However, this set of beliefs obscures the
changes in meaning of the liberal ideal over time
(see Liberalism). As every aspect of society in
England and the United States changed in the early
decades of the twentieth century, for example, as
the Great Depression produced the Wagner Act
and Social Security in the United States, curbing

`liberalism 
A creed and a history. Louis Hartz
perceives a liberal history of US political thought
based essentially upon John Locke, the “Lockian
creed” of individual liberty enshrined in the
Constitution and enacted by the Supreme Court.
The American way of life is the practical application of that creed with two exceptions (which
explain why the United States contrasts so distinctly from Europe): feudalism and therefore
socialism. He distinguishes two conflicting strands
of US liberalism: the “Whigs” (capitalist, wealthy,
big property owners) and petit bourgeois democrats. The element of “Algerism” (the drive to forge
ahead with luck and pluck) further energizes the
values of liberalism. Paradoxically, the addition of
nationalism and patriotism transforms liberalism
into its totalitarian, McCarthyite opposite.
The view from Europe differs because of its
feudal past and the ensuing conflictual rise of
socialism. Bullock and Shock, for example,
reveal the apparently incoherent but historically
evolutionary history of the Tory, Whig, Liberal,
and Socialist parties in England. English aristocratic Whig liberalism was born out of the
seventeenth-century struggle (the principles of
1688) for freedom of conscience and the resistance of Parliament to the arbitrary authority of
the king, out of which developed “the principles
of civil and religious liberty, the rule of law and
the freedom of the press, the institutions of parliamentary government, limited monarchy and
an independent judiciary” (p. xx).
This liberal tradition was challenged by new
growth in trade, industry, population, and the

middle class – a new class of manufacturers,
merchants, bankers, and businessmen – and by
newly authoritative utilitarian ideas. Two groups
of often linked thinkers provided new directions for liberalism: one, the political economists
(Adam Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, James Mill,
McCulloch, Nassau William Senior, and J.S. Mill);
the other, the Benthamites or philosophical
radicals (Bentham, James Mill, Grote, Romilly,
Place, Bowring, Molesworth, and Joseph Hume).
They were intensely individualist. All progress
derived from the unhampered initiative of selfinterested individuals; minimal government –
laissez-faire – should be the rule, since natural
economic laws operate invisibly for the general
good. Especially should the state avoid meddling
with foreign trade: free trade was the doctrine of
economists and philosophical radicals. Related
to this belief in noninterference in economics
were political ideas. In foreign policy they opposed
colonies and imperialism and supported national
liberation movements as in Greece; in domestic
policy they opposed governmental abuse of power
and supported civil liberties. The Whigs had
opposed the abusive powers of the monarchy; the
political economists and radicals opposed the
abusive powers of the monarchy and aristocracy
by advocating the extension of electoral democracy. Underlying all was a commitment to the
rationalist principle of reform through utility
and the liberation of natural forces in society.
Between 1830 and 1870 these ideas exerted great
influence in England. The logic of 1688 gradually
worked itself out in the Reform Bill of 1832,
extending the suffrage to the middle class and later
to the laboring class and women.
Nevertheless, they were not the sole direction
England was taking, for they were under attack
as early as the movement for state regulation
of the brutalities of the workplace, as in the
Ten Hours Bill. Experience and sympathy with
people struggling to be free taught liberals that
the gross inequalities bred by laissez-faire capitalism necessitated state intervention. From the
point of view of oppressed wage slaves or Radical
reformers, Tories and Whigs were scarcely distinguishable. Eventually support for state mediation in economics and other aspects of society
and the drive to extend political democracy produced the Liberal Party out of the Whigs in the
1860s.

joined with ideas of equality and justice, or at least

subordination went untouched), carried out in
the name of preserving individual opportunity

From the Free Trade Anti-Corn Law League
of the 1840s, to the struggle over Irish independence and sympathy with Italian liberty, to the
second Reform Act of 1867 as the next great step
in the extension of the franchise and the constituency of the Liberal Party, under the leadership of Palmerston and Gladstone the Liberal
Party changed the nature of British politics. From
1859 to 1874 Gladstone carried out a series of
Liberal reforms in free trade initiatives; the disestablishment of the Irish Church; the Education
Act of 1870; the opening of the universities to
Nonconformists, and the Civil Service to competitive examination; neutrality in the FrancoPrussian War; and many more. When he
returned to politics in 1874 he supported intervention in various international problems by
the Concert of Europe, by the European Powers
engaged not separately in imperialist pursuits
but jointly to ensure justice against aggression, as
in the Balkans. All peoples should enjoy freedom
and all nations should enjoy equality of rights,
he believed: Liberal views leading eventually to
the League of Nations and the United Nations.
The Liberal, utilitarian belief in the necessity
of freedom for the development of individuals
and nations is perhaps most dramatically seen
in Gladstone’s struggle for Irish Home Rule,
the Irish as much deserving of freedom as the
Italians, Greeks, and Bulgars. However, this
position split the Liberal Party.
Gradually the old Liberal commitment to
laissez-faire gave way to a new Liberalism based
upon the concept of liberty of opportunity backed
by the state. Less and less were the individual
and the state seen as separate and opposed; the
task of the state was more and more seen to be
the creation of conditions in which people could
exercise their faculties freely. The Reform Acts of
1867 and 1884, extending the franchise to almost
universal male suffrage, markedly qualified the
electoral monopoly which the middle and upper
classes had enjoyed since 1832, and, combined with
the depressions of the 1870s and 1880s, opened
the industrialized nation’s problems of poverty and
exploitation to more radical reforms. An early
manifestation of the new power of a workingclass electorate was the municipal socialism in
Birmingham in the 1870s, where Liberal Radicals
established public ownership and social welfare
programs. However, these changes took their

toll on the party by the transfer of allegiance of
manufacturing, commercial, and Whig constituencies to the Tories. And Gladstone’s
determination to carry Irish Home Rule drove
Radicals out of the party. Although the party
won in 1906 under Lloyd George, that year also
marked the foundation of the Labour Party.
Reforms continued under Lloyd George’s leadership of the Liberal Party, such as the Parliament
Act of 1911 which further extended political
democracy, and the Insurance Act, but increasingly the working classes demanded fundamental
changes in the economic and social system. After
the 1914–18 war the party steadily lost votes
to the Labour Party, which gradually replaced
it as instrument for those who sought radical
solutions to social problems. Nevertheless, the
Liberal Party as the party of reform based upon
the idea of individual liberty continued, and was
revitalized by the theories of Geoffrey Keynes
in the 1920s and 1930s, which rejected the antithesis of socialism and capitalism.
Continental European Liberals shared the same
goals: parliamentarianism; free market economics;
and freedom of speech, expression, and worship
(Salvadori, 1972). Liberty is the fundamental
value, the liberty of individual autonomy, the
capacity for choice. This capacity (and here is
a second key value) is based on reason. Liberty
and reason are inseparable, and together they
enable the growth of other central values – openmindedness, moderation, and toleration. These
values oppose the unreason of revelatory authoritarianism and dogmatism. Implied in these
values is an emphasis upon self-government
and therefore the parliamentary process; laws
derived from the consent of all and equal for
all; the value of private property as a guarantee
of individual autonomy; and education for
individual development and a prerequisite to
self-government. Liberals believe that this creative
freedom has produced the progress of increased
knowledge, better standards of living, and more
efficient governments.
Its origins are the advocates of religious tolerance in the sixteenth century; the self-governing
United Provinces in 1579; the English Bill of
Rights of 1689; the French Declaration of the
Rights of Man and Citizens of 1789, and the
Constitution of 1791. It became a clearly defined
movement embodied in parties and programs.

reforms, or at least better defensive rearguard
actions.

`linguistic criticism 
Linguistic criticism is
Text analysis which concentrates on the connections between language choices and the social
world. It is the distinctive contribution made
by Roger Fowler, with Robert Hodge, Gunter
Kress, Tony Trew, and Gareth Jones, to linguistic
theory and the sociology of language.
Linguistic critics hold that, far from having
unmediated access to the world, the members of
any (sub)Culture subscribe to particular belief
systems or ideologies which largely determine
their conception of reality. The world is a social
construct, and a major part of the structuration
takes place through language. Therefore systematic analysis of the language of the texts through

linguistic criticism

“In countless Continental revolutions between
1820 and 1876, Liberals played an important,
at times dominant, role” (Salvador, 1972, p. 3):
southern Europe in 1820–1; the Polish insurrection against Russia in 1830; the Swiss civil
war in 1847, Germany in 1848–9; and Italy in
1859–61. Liberalism was delayed by Bourbon
absolutism, Prussian militarism and Lutheranism, the armies of Austria and Louis-Napoleon,
and by the Vatican in Italy, but the liberal attack
on authoritarianism was heard everywhere –
Kossuth in Hungary, Mazzini in Italy, Thorbecke
in the Netherlands (and Bolivar in South
America). Thanks to Liberals, Switzerland,
Scandinavia, and the Lowlands became the most
advanced nations in continental Europe. During the first quarter of the twentieth century,
Liberal governments were headed by Caillaux
and Herriot in France, Stresemann in Germany,
Giolitti in Italy, Canalejas in Spain, Tisza in
Hungary, Venizelos in Greece, and in other
countries too. Liberals persuaded the Russian czar
to replace autocracy with limited constitutionalism, and Liberals (Lvov, Miliukov, Shingarev)
were leaders of the first provisional government
in 1917.
The enemies of Liberalism range from right
to left. Naziism and Stalinism suppressed Liberal
values and institutions. And some critics of
Liberalism detect hypocrisy in the discrepancies
between ideals and practice. For example, to
some the US banner of “freedom” seems only
a facade for power. When real freedom, not
merely formal freedom, has been energetically
pursued (trade unions, suffragettes, the poor,
blacks), the people have been met by repressive
laws, courts, police, and the army. “‘Liberalism’
is not a descriptive phrase for the experience
with civil liberties and rights in America, but
an ideological mystification to hinder it” (Kolko,
1984, p. 280).
The Liberalism of today has shed the exuberant
optimism of a Condorcet, who averred that human
perfectibility is indefinite, or of a Helvetius,
who believed human happiness awaited only a perfected education. The mass killings and torture
that continue with the increasing improvement
of weapons, the increasing mass malnutrition,
hunger, and starvation, the eradication of forests and species, the destruction of atmospheric
ozone and the creation of global warming, and

which members of a society interact – its social
Discourses – can lay bare the processes through
which language users attempt to uphold or oppose
any given status quo.
Although in principle eclectic, linguistic critics
rely mainly on concepts and methods derived
from systemic-functional linguistics (Halliday,
1978; 1985), a theory which shares their basic
assumptions about language and reality, and
incorporates a grammar based on the principle that
situational (social) features are instrumental in
determining language choices.
Any text type is open to linguistic criticism,
but a major interest of linguistic critics remains
the linguistic analysis of literary texts; in fact,
the term is intended to recall and contrast with
“literary criticism” (Fowler, 1981, p. 24).
In contrast with the objectivist assumptions
of many literary critics of the 1960s and 1970s
(see New criticism), linguistic critics hold that,
although literary texts are accorded special value,
there is nothing intrinsic to their language that
distinguishes them from other text types. Furthermore, literary texts “mean” only within a certain
cultural context, to readers/analysts who have
their own ideological position. No reading of
any kind of text is ever objective, so no text can
have any objective meaning.
Fowler is equally critical of structuralist linguists’
efforts to carry out linguistic analysis of (literary)
texts. He objects in particular to the assumption
that the analysis should treat every linguistic
aspect as equally significant. What makes linguistic analysis into linguistic criticism is that
the selection of features for the analysis to focus
on is informed by the analyst’s awareness that
extratextual factors influence linguistic choices.
Such extratextual factors are traditionally studied
by scholars in other disciplines such as sociology,
philosophy, and history, but linguistic criticism
and literary criticism must take account of these
disciplines, and of each other.
Another text genre favoured by linguistic
critics because of its high social visibility is newspaper reportage (see Fowler, 1991).
Most linguistic criticism is not only politically
aware, but avowedly politically motivated, its
proponents typically falling on the left of the
political spectrum. For this reason, the discipline
is often perceived as threatening or dismissed as
propagandist. This charge is unfounded, for the

method can be employed by analysts of any
political persuasion to examine any text type. It
is more difficult to dismiss some of the objections
raised by theorists favourably disposed toward the
aims of linguistic critics. For example, Thompson
(1984, p. 126) criticizes their identification of
“belief systems” with “ideologies,” their failure
to define either term, and the absence from their
work of a clearly defined theory of society.

`literacy 
The term “literacy” is used, in descriptions of individuals or whole social formations,
to indicate the possession of skills in reading and
writing. Much argument in Cultural theory
has been concerned, however, with exactly what
level of skills constitutes “literacy,” either now
or in earlier historical periods; and debate has
also focused on how literacy (which always exists
in a mix with oral channels of communication
and representation, and is unevenly distributed
across any given society) affects individual psychology, social organization, or cultural reproduction. Frequently the term is used metaphorically,
to indicate other interpretative or decoding skills,
as in “TV literacy,” “computer literacy,” or
“political literacy.”

`literary criticism 
Before the advent of Critical theory, literary criticism was commonly
regarded as the formulation and defense of
value judgments about works of literature by
people widely read in both literature and criticism.
Their institutional location was often universities and colleges, and like literary journalists
(but unlike critical theorists) they tended to
see their work as “secondary” to the “primary”
Texts of literature. However much it might
be despised by writers, literary criticism could
be perceived as the socially useful application of
quality controls to literary production by experts
whose job is to ensure that the highest standards
are maintained.
This construction of literary criticism rests
on two assumptions. First, that “literature” is an
identifiable commodity, easily distinguishable
not only from “nonliterature” but also from
inferior versions of itself, such as “popular literature” and “subliterature.” And second, that
“literary value” can be defined in such generally
acceptable terms that it can be appealed to by
literary critics as a criterion for distinguishing
good writing from bad. Both assumptions have
undergone radical critiques since Northrop Frye
ridiculed in his Anatomy of Criticism (1957) the
promotional and demotional games played by
literary critics with literary texts.
Earlier theories of literature are “essentialist”
in their contention that a literary work has distinctive features which mark its “literariness”
and enable us to distinguish literature from
nonliterature. These specificities are identified
with varying degrees of precision. Sometimes
ingredient x is as vague as “wit” in discussions
of seventeenth-century poetry, or “the sublime”
in the eighteenth century, or Organic unity
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. At
other times, however, it can be highly specific,
as when Russian Formalism claims that what
distinguishes “poetic” from nonpoetic uses of
language is that poetry manifests a “making
strange” (ostranenie) or “defamiliarization” of

ordinary language. Once identified, distinctive
features can be taken as normative, upgraded
to criteria of value, and applied prescriptively
as touchstones for promoting some texts and
demoting others. Every influential school of
criticism has privileged a particular type of text,
and treated the characteristics of such texts as
normative in order to discredit other modes of
criticism grounded on other types of text.
Consequently, texts can go in and out of
fashion with the changing of the critical guard.
Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene (1596) will
rank highly whenever “copiousness of invention”
is a criterion of excellence (as it was in sixteenthcentury rhetorical criticism); but when the principal criterion is “stylistic economy,” Spenser’s
poem will be judged too prolix for literary tastes
stimulated by heroic couplets in the eighteenth
century or imagist poems in the twentieth. Other
cornucopian texts – such as the plays of William
Shakespeare or the novels of James Joyce –
survive different styles of criticism by offering a
wide diversity of “characteristics,” and by appealing to different critics for different reasons create the illusion of transhistorical permanence.
Such phenomena lend credence to the rival
“constitutivist” theory that “assertions of value
refer primarily not to the structural properties
of texts, but to their performance as literary
texts” (Ellis, 1974, p. 102). A text is recognized
as literary not because of what it is (the essentialist
claim), but by being read as if it were literature,
just as Marcel Duchamp obliged people to view
a men’s urinal as if it were art when he exhibited
one in an art gallery. “Literature” is accordingly
not an essence but a category of writing, into
and out of which texts can be moved, as when
the Bible comes to be read “as literature,” or
Stephen Crane’s novel The Red Badge of Courage
(1895) as an eyewitness account of the American
Civil War. “Literature” is whatever a community
elects to call by that name and read in “literary”
ways. It becomes institutionalized by a pedagogical system which determines and then promulgates
a Canon of literary texts for study and oversees
the interpretation of its constituent texts.
Once secured by either essentialist or constitutivist practices, literary texts are duly processed
by the literary-critical machine. “Corrected” by
textual editors and annotated by scholars, they
are susceptible to three main types of critical

literary criticism

inquiry. An author-centered criticism will use
them as biographical or psychobiographical
evidence and judge the writer by the work, thus
committing what text-centered critics call the
biographical fallacy. In the twentieth century
text-centered critics have been guided by T.S.
Eliot’s modernist contention that great literature
is impersonal, and accordingly have bypassed
biography to focus on “the text itself.” Examples
include British Practical criticism as pioneered
by I.A. Richards and taught by William Empson
and F.R. Leavis; American New criticism as
practiced and popularized by Cleanth Brooks;
and the Deconstructionist criticism of J. Hillis
Miller and Paul De Man.
New Criticism scorned as the Affective
fallacy the proposition that literary critics ought
to concern themselves with how readers respond
to literary texts. Given the fact that there are
only three sites on which any kind of literary
criticism can establish itself – the author (producer), the text (product), and the reader
(reception) – it was perhaps inevitable that the
Hegemony of New criticism was broken not
by returning to author-based criticism (against
which text-based critics had defined themselves,
most notably in the theory of the Intentional
fallacy), but by focusing on the part played by
readers in the construction of literary meaning and
literary value. For if (as constitutivists claim)
literary texts are not “given” to us by authors but
constituted as such by reading practices, it follows
that literary texts are not the sources of literary
value but the sites on which literary values are
produced (cf. Bennett, 1979, p. 174). Literary
criticism thus mutates into the kind of reception
studies undertaken by Hans Robert Jauss and
the Reader-response criticism of Wolfgang
Iser and Stanley Fish.
Those mindful of the etymological derivation of the word “critic” from the Greek krites
(“judge”) usually favor the prescriptive view that
“evaluation” is the raison d’être of literary criticism.
Text-centered critics consider that judgments
should be based not on such “extrinsic” factors
as the writer’s “ideas” or “reputation,” but arrived
at inductively by a responsive attentiveness to
that most “intrinsic” phenomenon of all, the
words on the page of the text in itself. “Everything worth saying in criticism of verse and
prose,” F.R. Leavis declared, “can be related to

judgments concerning particular arrangements
of words on the page” (Leavis, 1948, p. 120). In
these terms, although the stockpiling of information about literary texts (bibliographical,
lexicographical, historical, explicatory, etc.) may
be a legitimate activity in the broad field of literary studies, it does not constitute literary criticism,
and may well be a way of avoiding the difficult
task of judging whether the text in question is
any good or not.
Developments in both the theory of language and the theory of value have weakened
the prescriptivist view that literary criticism
must be evaluative to justify its name. In the
early twentieth century a revolutionary shift of
emphasis in Language theories away from
prescriptive grammar (how to speak and write
correctly) to descriptive linguistics (how we
actually speak) helped make “description” a more
authentic mode of inquiry in the humanities
than “prescription.” It enabled us to see that the
purpose of a dictionary, for instance, is not to
enshrine the preferred “meanings” of words but
to record shifts in their “usage”: “correctness” here
becomes a relative term, measured by the appropriateness of a particular word or expression in
the context in which it is used. The definition
of literary criticism as evaluative thus becomes
merely one usage among many of a term which,
in the opinion of a scholar who has probably
read more criticism than anybody else, cannot
be defined more narrowly than “any Discourse
on literature” (Wellek, 1986, p. xvii).
In its evaluative form, literary criticism is
preoccupied with Value in literature, which
is seen as being intrinsic to literary works and
distinguishable from those extrinsic values by
which we live. The point of aestheticizing literary
texts in this way is to protect them against the kind
of “irrelevant” criticism which resulted in D.H.
Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover (1928) being
banned by moralists for its obscenity and castigated by feminists for its sexism. Such problems
can be obviated if the text is treated as an autonomous world of words whose formal excellences
can be appreciated and faults rebuked without
reference to such considerations as whether it
has “a tendency to deprave and corrupt” (the
legal definition of obscenity) or perpetuates the
oppression of women by offering demeaning
representations of them. It so happened that

421
Feminist criticism will demonstrate that the
dominant literary culture is masculinist, and
promote literary texts which embody alternative
and gynocentric values. And when literary value
is perceived as an ideological apparatus for
demoting texts produced by non-Europeans, the
consequences of its concealed and Eurocentric
racism will be critiqued by readers located in
Black cultural studies and Subaltern
studies. Each of these politicizing styles of
criticism comes to be further fissured by differences within it: feminist criticism, for example,
recognizing its own heterosexual bias, generated
lesbian feminist criticism, and its critique of
gender helped articulate a Gay politics, whose
institutionalization as gay studies was in turn
critiqued by queer theory.
Critical theory has not, as is sometimes
claimed, destroyed literary criticism, but taught
it to define its subject positions and procedures
with increased ideological awareness.

`literary production 
Marx and Engels
affirmed that, since human beings produce themselves and the objective world by labor, Art is
one aspect of production in general. This means
that literature is produced not only as an element
of superstructure by agents working within given
social, intellectual, and literary traditions, but
also enters into the relations of production which
comprise the economic infrastructure of society.
As the “final product” of a labor process which
works on raw materials, literature is part of the
dialectic of connections between production and
consumption. Hence the meanings of literary
Texts are conditioned by their status as commodities. These insights have been developed by
Marxist thinkers such as Lenin, Walter Benjamin,
Bertolt Brecht and Pierre Macherey, who
have attempted to displace the Romantic view
of literature as “creation” by accounting for it in

literary production

Lady Chatterley’s Lover was deemed on literary
criteria to be not a very good novel, and so the
business of matching intrinsic with extrinsic
evaluations is much less problematic here than in
the case of The Rainbow (1915), which offended
contemporary moralists but is highly esteemed by
nonfeminist critics as a modernist classic. This
is a recurrent problem for advocates of literary
value. If you admire the formal experimentalism
of Ezra Pound’s Cantos (1930–64), can you –
should you even try? – to ignore their fascist
politics if you yourself happen to be anti-fascist?
Can religious beliefs (or one’s lack of them) be
kept apart from a literary evaluation of T.S.
Eliot’s Four Quartets (1944)?
To those who think such distinctions are
neither possible nor desirable, the category of
literary value is obstructionist in distracting
attention from the social responsibilities of
writers and the social consequences of what they
write. For such readers, literary texts should
not be depoliticized by aestheticizing practices,
but politicized. This is to be done not by “introducing” politics into allegedly apolitical literary
works, but by drawing attention to the politics
which is there already (notably in the ways it
represents its subject matter), and by asking
whose interests are served by a critical practice
which overlooks such problems in the course of
attending to the text’s “purely” literary features.
As literary value becomes indistinguishable
from social value when literary texts come to be
politicized, value itself ceases to be thought of as
a transhistorical absolute and comes to be seen
instead as a variable construct, subject to historical contingencies and deeply fissured along
the fault lines of Race, Class, and Gender.
Value is treated as a front for various kinds of
hidden politics, each of which can be exposed and
opposed by the dominant styles of politicized
criticism. Should the crypto-politics of literary
criticism be deemed to be social class, for
instance, Marxist criticism will demonstrate that
the literary texts most favored by those middleclass people who historically have constituted
the readership for literature embody middleclass values, no matter how successfully they
may be thought of as having transcended the
specificities of class by their insights into a
common and classless humanity. When gender
is the crypto-politics targeted, various types of

and audience, and the possible revolutionary
transformation of the forces of artistic production
by the artists themselves. Non-Marxist theories
which have explored literature as production

and New historicism.

`logical positivism 
A movement of thought
that originated in Vienna during the 1920s,
exerting a strong (albeit short-lived) influence
on epistemology and philosophy of Science,
mainly in the English and German-speaking
countries. Its central tenet was the “verification
principle,” intended to clear away vast tracts
of meaningless “metaphysical” talk, or at least
to declare them out of bounds for the purposes
of rigorous analytic inquiry. This doctrine held
(i) that the meaning of a sentence, proposition,
or statement is given by its truth conditions; and
(ii) that such truth must either be determined by
empirical observation – that is, through direct
knowledge-by-acquaintance or the results of
scientific experiment – or derive solely from the
logical (analytic) form of the statement in question,
as with the truths of mathematics, geometry, and
strict deductive (syllogistic) reasoning. The latter
would be purely tautologous – that is, quite
devoid of factual or informative content – in so
far as their predicate contained nothing more than
was given in their subject. (Thus for instance: “all
bachelors are unmarried men.”)
The upshot of this program, rigorously applied,
was such as to render nonsensical most – if not
all – of our everyday speech acts and unregimented habits of talk, along with the “truths” (or
pseudo-truths) of Ethics, Aesthetics, theology,

sociology, psychology, and other such merely
“emotive,” “subjective,” or “evaluative” modes of
utterance. All the same, there were those, including some ethical philosophers and the literary critic
I.A. Richards, who were so impressed by the
seeming force of the logical-positivist case that they
adopted precisely such a face-saving rhetoric to
characterize their own endeavors. For Richards,
this entailed a complete severance between the
realm of poetic meaning and that of propositional
truth. Thus poems possessed “emotive” value in
their use of “pseudo-statements” – or makebelieve (non-truth-functional) orders of utterance
– to evoke certain rich and complex states of mind
in the receptive reader. This anti-cognitivist bias
in literary theory has remained a constant factor
during manifold changes of doctrine and fashion,
from the American New criticism of the 1940s
to recent Poststructuralism. The same reactive
pattern may be seen in Roland Barthes’s early
polemic Critique et verité, directed against the
supposed value-neutrality of traditional (positivist) French literary scholarship.
One notable exception to this rule is William
Empson’s fine but neglected book The Structure
of Complex Words (1951). Here he takes issue
not only with Richards but also – in a lengthy
Appendix – with proponents of the emotivist
view in ethics, anthropology, and philosophy
of Language. For Empson, this amounts to a
vote of no confidence in human reason, allied to
a taste for certain forms of paradoxical mysterymongering which leave judgment open to the
“active false logic” of irrationalist creeds and
doctrines. His response is to elaborate a theory
of logico-semantic implication which applies
just as much to literary as to other (scientific
or “everyday”) uses of language, and which thus
comes out in firm opposition to any idea of
poetry as somehow exempt from the standards
of plain-prose rational accountability. Empson is
quite clear about the limits of the logical-positivist
program, its incapacity to deal with the greater
part of what we (rightly) take as meaningful
statements with a fair claim to assertoric warrant
and truth-telling status. Nevertheless, he also
sees the need, unlike Richards, to extend and
refine the resources of logical analysis to a point
where it becomes adequate to account for those
complex orders of meaning (too easily treated
as “emotive”) that characterize poetic language.

`Lovejoy, Arthur O. (1873–1961) 
Philosopher and intellectual historian. Author of The
Revolt Against Dualism and The Great Chain of
Being, Lovejoy was a central figure in American
philosophical debates of the first half of the
twentieth century.
The product of a childhood marked by the death
of his mother in his infancy and the influence
of a strongly evangelical father, Lovejoy’s early
intellectual development centered upon a reaction
to the uncertainty of the emotions and intense
religious experience by postulating the clarity
and efficacy of reason. He broke through the
somewhat rigid mores of the American philosophical academy by becoming, in effect, a “historian of ideas” whose objective was to construct
a philosophy which made the experienced universe
intelligible.
Within Lovejoy’s investigations only epistemological and psychological dualism could allow
the coexistence of a real sensory world and a
world of ideas. His search for a vindication for
the efficacy of ideas led to his widely read interdisciplinary work The Great Chain of Being, in
which he followed the ideas of plenitude, continuity, and gradation from their Aristotelian
origins through the Romantic period of the
early nineteenth century. Building upon earlier
work on the creation of what he referred to as a
“rational theology,” Lovejoy’s philosophical perspective was essentially psychological, dwelling
upon origins of human motivation and behavior
– linking his method of inquiry to Smith’s Theory
of Moral Sentiments as a systematic approach to
creating a new, comprehensive history of human
intellectual development.
Lovejoy was also known for his groundbreaking work in establishing and defending
standards and conventions (vis-à-vis the necessity
of open exchange of ideas) for academic freedom
within the American academy.

Lovejoy, Arthur O.

That his book has received so little serious
attention from subsequent literary theorists is
a measure of both its profound originality and
their lingering suspicious attitude toward logical
positivism in its full-fledged, hardline, or reductive variants.
In fact, that program turned out to harbor
deep-laid difficulties, even for its most committed supporters. After all, as was quickly
remarked, the verification principle failed to
make sense on its own terms, since it was neither
analytically (self-evidently) true by virtue of its
logical form, nor susceptible to proof from
direct observation or empirical test procedures.
Under pressure from skeptical philosophers like
Quine – notably in his essay “Two dogmas of
empiricism” – the positivist program gave way
by degrees to a holistic (or contextualist) theory
of meaning which rejected the analytic/synthetic
distinction, maintained that all statements
(whether logical or factual) were open to radical
reinterpretation under different “ontological
schemes,” and thus – in Quine’s famous
metaphor – relativized truth to the entire existing “web” or “fabric” of beliefs held true at any
given time. Whence it followed that belief in
centaurs or in Homer’s gods was ontologically
on a par with belief in the axioms of Euclidean
geometry, the ground rules of logic, or the existence of brick houses on Elm Street, just so long
as one’s scheme was adjusted here and there (or
subject to wholesale revision) in such a way as
to accommodate those items. And so it came
about, ironically enough, that these developments in “postanalytic” philosophy could be
drawn (by shrewdly eclectic commentators such
as Richard Rorty) into a kind of loose-knit tactical alliance with Hermeneutic, Postmodern,
and poststructuralist strains of Cultural and
Literary theory. Nothing could be further
from what the logical positivists envisaged
when they first set out to place philosophy of
science on a firm methodological footing.

`Lukács, Gyorgy 
(Georg) (1885–1971)
Hungarian philosopher, politician, aesthetician.
Born into a wealthy Jewish family in Budapest,
Lukács was to launch on an intellectual and
political journey which, though fraught with
antagonism, compromise, and reversals, left him
the highest star in the constellation of twentiethcentury Marxist aestheticians. His doctorate,
conducted under George Simmel’s supervision in
Berlin, was in sociology, and his initial interest
in Marx was as a sociologist. He subsequently
moved in an interdisciplinary circle of acquaintances which included Ernst Bloch and Max
Weber. As well as falling under the influence of
these figures, he was indebted to Kierkegaard,
Heidegger, Georges Sorel, Rosa Luxemburg,
Kant, and especially Hegel. A general orientation toward philosophical idealism is evident in
his major works of this period: Soul and Form
(1911), History of the Development of Modern
Drama (1911), and The Theory of the Novel
(1916). The last of these advances Lukács’s
renowned thesis that the novel is the epic of the
modern world, attempting to reconstitute formally
a unity (of abstract and concrete, universal and
particular) belonging to the world of the epic but
long since shattered by subsequent historical configurations (Lukács, 1916 (1971a), pp. 56–69).
Returning to Budapest in 1917, Lukács joined
the Hungarian Communist Party in 1918, his
decision inspired largely by the Russian Revolution but also representing a culmination of his lifelong hatred of capitalism. Thereafter, his aesthetic
concerns were eclipsed by political imperatives.
He became Commissar of Education in the shortlived Communist government of 1919 under
Bela Kun, after whose overthrow he escaped to
Austria, traveling thence to Germany and Russia.
His History and Class Consciousness (1923) suffered
a hostile reception from the Communist movement, on a number of accounts: it overlooked the
centrality of labor to Marxist analysis; it offered
an idealistic concept of revolutionary praxis; and

above all, it attempted to reinstate the Hegelian
category of totality at the center of the Marxist
system, drawing a direct line of descent from
the Hegelian dialectic to historical materialism,
relegating the intermediary role of Feuerbach to
the background. It also defined orthodoxy in
Marxism as exclusively a question of methodology rather than content, and conducted an
unwelcome polemic against Engels.
Lukács was later to admit that in some ways
his book had effectively attempted to “out-Hegel
Hegel” (1923 (1971b), p. xxiii). The book was
denounced with particular vehemence by Bela
Kun whose political sectarianism Lukács had
strategically and bitterly opposed. However, its
analysis of class consciousness, and particularly of
Alienation as central to the critique of capitalist society, exerted a profound influence on not
only Marxist theory but also other areas such as
French Existentialism. It stands in a sense at the
centre of Lukács’s Canon, as the final synthesis
of his development since 1918 and marking
the turning toward his subsequent economically
grounded vision of Hegel’s dialectic. Lukács’s
strategic publication of a self-criticism and his
monograph, Lenin: A Study on the Unity of His
Thought (1924) a more orthodox study, went
some way toward reconciling him with the Party.
He regarded such a strategy as his “entry-ticket”
into history, since Communism appeared to
furnish the only effective forum for meaningful
resistance to emerging fascism.
In 1928, as the Hungarian Communist Party
prepared for its Second Congress, Lukács was
asked to draft its political theses. The resulting
“Blum Theses,” urging the Party to work toward
an independent rather than soviet republic,
were regarded as regressive, since Hungary had
already been allied as a soviet republic in 1919.
Notwithstanding Lukács’s publication of a selfcriticism, the climate of fierce antagonism to his
proposals obliged him to withdraw from politics
in 1929. This initiated his more or less exclusive
devotion to Marxist theory and Aesthetics. In
1930–1 he took up a research post at the Marx–
Engels Institute in Moscow, where his reading of
Marx’s recently deciphered Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (Marx, 1959 (1981))
struck him with the force of a revelation. He saw
this text as confirming his insistence, in History,
on the importance of alienation in Marxist theory

425
ist, his characters embodying historically typical
traits in the very texture of their individuality.
Regarding realism in drama, Lukács sees Shakespeare as concentrating typical human relations
around historical collisions “with a force unparalleled before and after him.” Lukács’s aesthetics
at this stage might be summarized by his comment of 1931 that the portrayal of human character is a question of applying dialectics in the
field of literature (1980, p. 26). Lukács views
the mere photographic reproduction of reality
by art as naturalism, a category whose derogated
status embraces much literature written under
the banner of Zhdanovism, as well as many of
Balzac’s realist successors such as Flaubert (1937
(1962), pp. 193–9).
Lukács also arrays his notions of realism against
the ideology and literary forms of modernism
which he sees as a descendant of naturalism.
In his view, the ontological image of the human
being offered by modernists such as Joyce, Beckett,
and Kafka is asocial, alienated, fragmented, and
pathologically inept as a political agent. Lukács
rejects the power of this image to act as a critique
of capitalism because it is not only ahistorical but
also elevates alienation to a seemingly eternal
condition humaine. He had in fact been embroiled in the 1930s in a controversy with Bertolt
Brecht, whose own “Alienation effect” was
in Lukács’s eyes part of a formalist procedure.
However, their notions of realism actually overlapped in crucial imperatives, such as that to
capture the “typical” or “historically significant,”
a fact overridden in the perhaps politically
motivated mutual opposition of these writers.
After the 1939–45 war Lukács was appointed
professor of aesthetics and philosophy at the
University of Budapest. His works of philosophical and aesthetic synthesis in this period
included The Destruction of Reason (1954) and
The Meaning of Contemporary Realism, written
in 1956. After the popular uprising against
Communism in the same year, Lukács became
Minister of Culture in Imre Nagy’s coalition,
whose government was terminated abruptly by
Soviet tanks. The first of these works displays
Lukács’s continuing preoccupation, in the context of German thought and literature, with the
struggle between rationalistic humanism and barbaric irrationalism. In The Specific Nature of the
Aesthetic (1962) Lukács confronts the enormous

Lukács, Gyorgy

and as underlining that book’s essential failure
to view alienation as only one specific instance
of what Hegel had called objectification or
externalization. In an earlier review, Lukács had
insisted, as against Bukharin (at the time second
only to Stalin in the leadership of the Russian
Communist Party) that economic forces are the
determinants, not the products, of technological
development. Lukács’s work on Lassalle and
Moses Hess also impelled him to define more
closely the connection between economics and
dialectics, culminating in his massive and brilliantly
intricate The Young Hegel (1938 (1975)). An
imposing feature of this work is its articulate
attempt to distinguish between Marxist integrations of Hegel and distorted bourgeois versions
which assimilate Hegel into either Romantic or
irrational thought, which Lukács viewed as a
slippery incline toward despotic and imperialist
apologetics (1975, pp. 3–16).
After a two-year stay in Berlin, Lukács was
forced to flee in 1933 to the Soviet Union, where
he stayed until 1944. His study of the connections between dialectics and economics and the
ontology of social being generated an attempt
to construct a Marxist aesthetics. His literary
studies during this period also assumed a coded
anti-Stalinist role while exhibiting a surface
continuity with the official Socialist realism
promulgated especially by Stalin’s overseer of
“Ideology,” A.A. Zhdanov. These studies included The Historical Novel (1937) and essays
later collected under the titles Goethe and His
Age (1947), Studies in European Realism (1948),
and Essays on Thomas Mann (1949). In these
works Lukács correlates the rise of genres such
as the historical novel with a bourgeois growth of
historical consciousness, itself grounded in economic transformations. Sir Walter Scott, Balzac,
and Tolstoi are viewed as the great exemplars of
“realism” in the sense advocated by Lukács.
At the centre of Lukács’s concept of realism
is precisely the category of totality expressed
in History, based on Hegel’s notion of the concrete universal whereby the universal is not
separate from but immanent in its particular
expressions. Hence Lukács advocates a theory
of reflection whereby Art expresses a totality
of historical forces rather than mechanically
documenting accidentally related surface details
of the world. He views Balzac as the greatest real-

Lyotard, Jean-François

426
task of constructing a Marxist aesthetic, a project
which includes:
(i)

viewing the aesthetic contextually as one
mode of reflecting reality among others
and elaborating the specific traits of the
aesthetic mode as expressing objectivity
conjoined with peculiarity of subjective
conditions and genesis;
(ii) understanding art as another form of
humans making themselves through their
work; the articulation of a genuinely dialectical and historical method as well as the
historical nature of objective reality itself;
(iii) stressing the connections between Marxism and other traditions of thought
(Lukács draws upon Aristotelian mimesis
as well as ideas from Goethe, Lessing, and
others); and
(iv) clarifying the opposition between idealist
and materialist aesthetics as well as the
historical and ideological relations between
immanence and transcendence.
In 1971 Lukács produced Towards an Ontology
of Social Being and had planned a study of Ethics
which was still in its initial stages at the time of
his death. Whatever unity can be claimed by
Lukács’s work as a whole rests on his persistent
return to Hegel and his sustained endeavor to
understand and clarify Marx and the Marxist
tradition through the logical and historical
schematic avenues opened up by the Hegelian
dialectic. His ideas, in particular his analyses of
Alienation, class consciousness, and the dialectical character of Marxism, have had far-reaching
reverberations for those who have opposed the
Hegelian orientation of his work as well as
those who have developed it. He is arguably
the profoundest philosopher that Marxism has
produced.

`Lyotard, Jean-François (1925–1998) 
JeanFrançois Lyotard first became widely known
and discussed in the English-speaking world
with the publication of the English translation
of his book The Postmodern Condition in 1984,
and indeed remains influential as an analyst and
proponent of Postmodernism. But he also has
to his credit a very considerable body of philosophical, political, and aesthetic writings, which
are now beginning to be more widely known
and understood. He was connected from 1954
to 1964 with the Marxist group Socialism or
Barbarism, a loose affiliation of workers, militants,
and intellectuals, and was particularly active in
his support for the revolutionary insurrection
in Algeria, and critical of the French military
response. During the late 1960s he became a leading figure in attempts to transform the institution
where he held his own post as teacher of philosophy, the University of Paris at Nanterre, and
in the notorious événements of May 1968 which
proceeded from this. Lyotard’s suspicion of
institutionalized knowledge and bureaucratized
control of thought is to be seen in his denunciation at the time of “the inevitable subordination
of both the ‘contents’ of culture and the pedagogical relation to the sole operative categories of
capital: production and consumption” (Lyotard,
1993, p. 48). Like many other French intellectuals
taking part in the 1968 uprising, Lyotard turned
away in its defeated aftermath more and more
emphatically from the institutions of politics
themselves, especially those associated with the
Communist Party and bureaucratic state Marxism.
In an essay written in 1989, Lyotard construes the
principles of the Socialism or Barbarism group in
terms which in fact anticipate the preoccupations
in his own work which led to his distancing from
the group:
The idea that guided Socialism or Barbarism
was ultimately . . . the idea that there is something
within a system that it cannot, in principle, deal

427

Much of the rest of Lyotard’s work is concerned
with defining the nature of such unspeakable,
unsystematic, but politically potent “events”
within formal political or philosophical systems.
As he puts it in his more recent philosophical
idiom, it is a matter of finding ways of acknowledging and respecting “the has-it-happened-yet
. . . that thing that the event is even before
signification” (Van Reijen and Veerman, 1988,
p. 301). His Discours, Figure, which appeared in
1971 (and remains untranslated), and Libidinal
Economy (1974, trans. 1993) draw on psychoanalysis to articulate a radical politics centered
on the mobile intensity of drives and bodily
pulsations, rather than on the formal orderings
and channelings of such intensity, for example,
by language, that Freud called the secondary
processes. Discours, Figure distinguishes the realm
of “figure,” or primary psychic process, from the
realm of “discourse,” or secondary process, which
mediates and contains the eruptive force of the
figural. As in the contemporary work of Gilles
Deleuze, Félix Guattari, and Julia Kristeva,
the force and experience of the aesthetic are
central to Lyotard’s politics of intensity.
By the late 1970s and early 1980s Lyotard had
become more than ever disillusioned with the
presumptuous universalism of formal Marxism.
At the same time his work began to show a concern with questions of morality, justice, and
legitimacy which had not been conspicuous in
the extravagant and volatile ultra-leftism of his
writing in the 1970s. It appears, for example, in
his work La Condition Postmoderne (1979, trans.
1984). This book argues that the modern period
since the late eighteenth century has been governed
by the power of certain universalizing “metanarratives” in philosophy and politics, notably the
Hegelian narrative of the emancipation of selfconscious spirit through history, and, linked to
this, the Marxist narrative of progressive universal political emancipation. Lyotard argues that
the power exercised by such narratives, either
to assimilate or to exclude all other identities,
histories, and temporalities, is totalitarian, and

leads inexorably to horrors such as the Holocaust.
The postmodern condition is one of “incredulity”
toward metanarratives. In place of the dominative and self-legitimating “we” of the universal
humanity presupposed and sustained by such
metanarratives, Lyotard imagines with optimism
a world of multiple, small-scale collectivities,
none of which has the legitimacy to subordinate
others. Central to this analysis is the concept of
“language games” which Lyotard borrows from
the later Wittgenstein. A language game may
be defined as the form of shared Symbolic
action constituted by every act of communication. Language games include such actions as
describing, promising, prescribing, and exhorting.
In his later work The Differend (1984, trans.
1988), Lyotard extends this analysis. Central to
this work, as it is to Just Gaming (Lyotard and
Théhaud, 1979, trans. 1985), a series of discussions about the nature of justice which reads like
an informal preparation for The Differend, is the
sense of the fundamental injustice that is done
whenever one language game is subordinated
to or interpreted in the light of another. Lyotard
proposes that justice consists in remaining attentive to the conditions of “differend,” or absolute
incommensurability, which obtain between utterances or language games that conflict without
there being any third language game in which
to mediate them. It is the role above all of Art,
especially the postmodernist art that Lyotard has
promoted since the late 1970s, to preserve and bear
witness to the incommensurability of languages
and the multiplicity of ways of being. Central
to this concern with the ethical responsibility of
art is Lyotard’s rereading of Immanuel Kant’s
philosophy of the sublime in his Critique of
Judgement (1790, trans. 1952). Kant described
the experience of the sublime as the dizzying
sense of a failure of correspondence between
an experience or idea, and the conceptual structures we have available to understand it. For
Lyotard, the principle of the sublime is not so
much that of inconceivable largeness, as it was
for Romantic aesthetic philosophy, as the unencompassable complexity of human relations and
events (Lyotard, 1991, trans. 1994). Lyotard’s
promotion of a postmodernist art of the sublime
is intended to preserve that paradoxical representation of the fact of unrepresentability. In
his later work, including a collection of essays

Lyotard, Jean-François

with . . . something intractable is hidden and
remains lodged at the secret heart of everything
that fits into the system, something that cannot
fail to make things happen in it. (Lyotard, 1993,
pp. 166–7)

Lyotard, Jean-François

428
entitled The Inhuman (1988, trans. 1991),
Lyotard refocused some of these questions in
terms of the transformed experience of time
in the postmodern world, arguing for an art and
philosophy that will resist the desire for the
absolute domination of time, based as it is on
the violent forgetting of the inevitable lack or
irresolution of being that temporal existence
creates.

`Macherey, Pierre (1938–) 
French Marxist
theoretician, former pupil and collaborator of
Louis Althusser, and senior lecturer in philosophy at the University of Paris (Sorbonne).
Macherey’s work has focused on three main areas:
(i) elaboration and rectification of a Marxist
theory of literature; (ii) elucidation of the
philosophical singularity of Spinoza as a critic,
avant la lettre, of Hegelianism and its Marxist
reprises; (iii) investigations of modern French
philosophy (in particular, the development of
the tradition of “historical epis-temology” by
Georges Canguilhem and Michel Foucault).
A year after his contribution to the collective
Althusserian rereading of Marx’s Capital (1965),
Macherey’s 1966 book, on which his reputation
in the anglophone world is based, appeared in
Althusser’s Théorie series. More tentative in selfconception than its English title suggests, Pour
une théorie de la production littéraire employed
Bachelardian–Althusserian categories to initiate
a theory of the differentia specifica of literary
Discourse, in its complex interrelations with
Ideology and science. Insisting upon the autonomy, as opposed to the independence, of literary
Texts, Macherey sought to displace nonMarxist Formalism (literature as the aesthetic
transcendence of ideology) and vulgar Marxist
reductionism (literature as the aesthetic transcription of ideology). Against the then dominant
Canons of Marxist criticism – especially the
realism of Georg Lukács – Macherey rejected

any conception of literary works as creation
(“Humanism”); as the expression of a Class
subject (“Historicism”); as the translation of
ideology (“reductionism”); or as the reflection/
representation of reality (“Empiricism”).
In accordance with Althusser’s concept of practice, the literary text was conceived by Macherey
as the end product of a labor of artistic transformation of ideological and linguistic raw materials.
A scientific criticism would eschew evaluation and
interpretation, both of which effectively replaced
the object of analysis, and instead attend to the
text as a determinate material practice in and on
ideology (understood, in Althusserian fashion, as
the unconscious medium of human existence). The
effect of literary form was to fissure the unity of
the text and “produce” ideology in such a way as
to expose its relations with its sociohistorical
conditions of existence. “[T]he analogy of a
knowledge and a caricature of customary ideology” (1966, p. 59), the literary text furnished an
“implicit critique” of ideology, whose modalities
could by grasped via a Symptomatic reading
of the text’s “Unconscious.”
Foreseeing the cooperation of a range of
disciplines (historical Materialism, Freudian
Psychoanalysis, and Saussurean linguistics) in
a sui generis but non-autarkic Marxist criticism,
Macherey’s ingenious proposals were widely
adopted and adapted in the 1970s (for example,
by Terry Eagleton in England). However,
although advancing a powerful critique of the prior

Marxist inheritance, they were in turn subjected
to telling criticism – for example, for postulating
an invariant literature–ideology relationship and
assigning a privileged status to the literary aesthetic
(see Bennett, 1979). In response (for example,
Macherey and Balibar, 1974), Macherey drew
upon the linguistic research of Renée Balibar and
Althusser’s notion of the educational Ideological state apparatus to sketch a theory of
literary reproduction, which was not, however,
readily exportable from France. Macherey’s subsequent work has been more strictly philosophical in character for the most part (for example,
his reading of Spinoza (1979) as anti-Hegel and
anti-Descartes). However, in a recent collection
(1990) his principal interests have converged in
studies of French “literary philosophy.”

`MacIntyre, Alasdair (1929–)
 American
philosopher. Although he had already written a
history of ethics and several other books, it was
not until the publication of After Virtue: A Study
in Moral Theory in 1981 that MacIntyre became
a central figure in contemporary ethical theory.
His work has generated wide interest in three main
areas: the importance of virtue- rather than rulebased ethical theories, the ethical importance of
narrative, and (although he denies the attribution)
“communitarian” attacks on liberalism.
After Virtue’s central historical-philosophical
thesis is that the failures of Enlightenment ethical
theories (like those of Kant and the utilitarians)
as well as those of their twentieth-century heirs
(like Hare and Rawls) leave us with the choice:
Aristotle or Nietzsche? Aristotle’s teleological
ethics was precisely what Enlightenment theories
rejected, and so they failed to contextualize their

moral rules within a structure including the
contrast between “human-nature-as-it-happensto-be” and “human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-itrealized-its-telos.” By rejecting the notion of a
human telos Kant and the utilitarians left no
genuine function for their moral rules to play
(MacIntyre, 2007, chapter 5). This then led to
“emotivist” critiques of those theories (critiques
based on the notion that morality is nothing but
an expression of personal preference or feeling).
Though emotivism fails on philosophical grounds
– moral expressions, unlike expressions of feeling,
at least purport to objectivity – morality in contemporary life is deployed as if emotivism were
true, as we engage in ethical “debates” we know
to be rationally interminable. Nietzsche saw more
clearly than others the nature of the Enlightenment’s failure and tried to articulate, according
to MacIntyre, a kind of honest emotivism, one that
no longer masked its desire for power.
By contrast MacIntyre develops a neoAristotelian account of the virtues that contains
at least three crucial features (MacIntyre, 2007,
chapters 14 and 15). (1) Certain coherent,
complex, cooperative, and socially established
human activities (“practices”) involve a contrast
between “internal” and “external” goods – goods
that can only come from within the performance
of an activity as opposed to goods attainable in
all sorts of ways, like wealth or prestige. The
virtues are those human qualities that allow us to
attain internal goods and without which we cannot attain them. (2) Rather than the democratized,
fragmented self of emotivism, MacIntyre develops a “narrative concept of selfhood”: our actions
and selves are intelligible only because of the
stories we tell. (The human being is, as he puts
it, “essentially a story-telling animal.”) Human life
has the unity of a quest – a quest for the good
human life – and so the virtues are those qualities which sustain that quest and the narratives
required for it. (3) Narratives and the achievement
of internal goods are not simply the work of isolated individuals, but instead require a historical
context. Traditions provide that context and the
virtues thus require traditions to sustain them.
In After Virtue MacIntyre, unlike emotivists,
refuses to give up the notions of moral truth and
rationality, and his subsequent works attempt to
develop these notions more fully even as they
expand and modify MacIntyre’s historical tale.

431
Over twenty-five years after its initial publication, MacIntyre has “as yet found no reason for
abandoning the major contentions of After Virtue”
(MacIntyre, 2007, p. ix). One finds throughout his
work that though historical development (including “real life” history, not merely “history of
thought”) is central to his philosophical approach,
he also has a Socratic sense for the importance
of living one’s thought. As his opening remarks
in the “Prologue” to the third edition of After
Virtue (MacIntyre, 2007) show, he both attempts
to criticize opponents from the inside and takes
the criticism of others very seriously; taken
together these bespeak a commitment to philosophical dialectic that is perhaps rarer among
“professional philosophers” than it should be.

`MacKinnon, Catharine (1946–) 
US feminist legal scholar and activist. Catharine
MacKinnon’s controversial analysis of sexual
violence provided the theoretical foundation
for the feminist anti-pornography movement
launched in the 1980s in the United States and
Canada. All of MacKinnon’s work, beginning with
her first book, Sexual Harassment of Working
Women (1979), proceeds from the axiom that male
supremacy informs every aspect of women’s lives:
from the segregation, stratification (devaluation),

MacKinnon, Catharine

MacIntyre develops his original Aristotelian
outlook further, along Thomist lines, “in part
because [he] became convinced that Aquinas
was in some respects a better Aristotelian than
Aristotle” (MacIntyre, 2007, p. x). Exploring conflicts between several philosophical traditions –
including the tradition of political liberalism –
Whose Justice? Which Rationality? (MacIntyre,
1988) develops an account of truth that attempts
to go between the horns of the absolutist–relativist
dilemma, via the “rationality of traditions.” Only
traditions that allow themselves to be called into
question can be deemed rational, and MacIntyre
suggests that liberalism may fall short on this
score. MacIntyre’s own view is not relativistic, in
spite of what some of his critics have charged,
in part because it is possible for one tradition to
defeat another by showing why the other tradition must run into the unsolved problems it has,
in fact, run into (MacIntyre, 2007, p. xiii). Three
Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry (MacIntyre, 1990)
offers a fairly detailed account of the history of
the university as part of an argument against the
Enlightenment project, here understood as the
encyclopedia tradition, and against Nietzsche’s
heirs, e.g. Michel Foucault. The former are
criticized for their understanding of “progress,”
while the latter are put to the test on the question of the possibility of a genealogy of their own
genealogies. In thinking through MacIntyre’s
positions here, it is important not to confuse
“tradition” and “community,” for MacIntyre
denies that he is a communitarian, saying that
he “see[s] no value in community as such”
(MacIntyre, 2007, p. xiv).
In Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human
Beings Need the Virtues (MacIntyre, 1999),
MacIntyre deepens his account of virtue by contextualizing it through a discussion of the relations
between the human intellect and that of some
other animals, and in his most recent work,
God, Philosophy, Universities: A Selective History
of the Catholic Philosophical Tradition (MacIntyre,
2009), he explores the approach to God in
thinkers from Augustine to Newman and beyond
(including Islamic and Jewish thinkers), as well
as intertwining that exploration with a history of
the development of the university (with some
important reflections on its current status) and
some aspects of the multifold relationship between
philosophy and reflection on God.

and sexualization of women’s work to the construction of feminine personality, sexuality, and
even quite literally, the construction of women’s
very bodies as small, weak, and vulnerable. Unlike
French feminist theories, MacKinnon’s does not
posit the existence of a natural, or essential, female
body: women’s sexuality, in fact sex itself, is
redefined as the eroticized and sexualized subordination of women to men. Because male supremacy can be maintained only by the coercion of
women, what passes as sexuality in Patriarchy
is always infused with violence against women.
MacKinnon’s critique of the laws relating to sexual violence therefore emphasizes the impossibility
of distinguishing between “sex” and “violence,”
between “normal” and “criminal” sexual activity. In a collection of engaging public speeches,
Feminism Unmodified (1987), MacKinnon defends
her definition of pornography as “the sexually
explicit subordination of women through pictures or words that also includes women presented
dehumanized as sexual objects who enjoy pain,
humiliation, or rape; women bound, mutilated,
dismembered, or tortured; women in postures of
servility or submission or display; [or] women
being penetrated by objects or animals.” This
definition represents a significant discursive shift,
for the Discourse of pornography had been
structured historically by concepts of obscenity and
free speech. The anti-pornography laws based on
her work thoroughly break with legal tradition:
they are civil rights laws allowing victims of
coercion, force, assault, and trafficking to sue
civilly for reparation of harm inflicted on them
by users of pornography.
MacKinnon’s theory of women’s relationship
to the state, articulated in Toward a Feminist
Theory of the State (1989), begins with the observation that men dominate women without the
support of positive law and that male supremacy
is inscribed in and legitimated by legal discourse
such that women’s pursuits of remedies for
sexual oppression rarely succeed in the courts.
She concludes by redefining key legal concepts
such as consent, privacy, and especially equality.
MacKinnon argues that legal reasoning is governed
by male supremacist epistemologies, which have
particular difficulty imagining the possibility that
“difference” and “equality” might coexist. In such
a context, the claims of women and racial
minorities for “equality” have been continually

thwarted; the law functions to ensure white male
supremacy, reifying dominance as “difference”
and legitimating coercion so that it looks like
“consent.” Here, as in Feminism Unmodified,
MacKinnon carefully distinguishes her own project from both Marxist and liberal ones.
In her most recent work, Only Words (1993),
MacKinnon carefully scrutinizes the “collision
course” of legal and other discourses concerning
equality and free speech, recommending, first,
a thorough critique of the way the First Amendment has been used to valorize the speech of
ruling classes while silencing subjugated ones
and, second, a reinterpretation of the Fourteenth
Amendment in positive terms concerned less
with prohibiting violations than with “chartering
legal intervention for social change” (p. 73). In
plain terms, MacKinnon argues that, because
the freedom of the powerful constitutes the
inequality of the powerless, their speech must be
constrained in order to liberate the silenced
speech of those whom they oppress. Finally, her
argument critiques both Speech act theory and
Deconstruction as she examines the material
conditions under which words are construed
either formalistically as “only words” or as acts
themselves. Anyone interested in the scholarly
debates concerning the materiality of discourse
would want to consider her insistent argument that
the pornographer’s text was once a woman’s life.
MacKinnon has been severely criticized by
the right as well as the Liberal left, including
feminists, some of whom are concerned that
the radical feminist premises of her work would
be recuperated by the state and used to censor
other feminists, particularly lesbians and other
unpopular sexual minorities. An extremely vocal
constituency of post-structural critics, including
Donna Haraway (1985), objects to MacKinnon’s
“version of radical feminism [as] a caricature of
the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies of Western theories of identity grounding action” (p. 200). In this view, MacKinnon’s
argument is one that not only polices and
suppresses difference among women, but also
produces a narrow and authoritarian doctrine
of women’s experience: if male dominance and
desire defines both “woman” and “sex,” then
woman is a nonbeing whose only experience is
that of sexual violation. More recently, Teresa Ebert
(1993) defended MacKinnon from these charges

`Marcuse, Herbert (1898–1979) 
German
philosopher. A central figure in the Frankfurt
school of critical theorists. Marcuse remained
in the United States after Horkheimer and
Adorno returned to Germany in the early
1950s. He later became a prominent spokesman
of the New left. He is best known for his
application and development of the perspective
of Frankfurt Critical theory to the task of
rethinking the politics of self-emancipation. His

consistent commitment to politics, and a preoccupation with the practical fate of the Marxist
enterprise, set Marcuse apart from other members
of the Frankfurt school and enabled him to find
a wider audience for their ideas during the heady
days of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Marcuse was among the first of an older generation of Marxists to look “outside” the working
classes of advanced capitalized societies for sources
of anti-capitalist revolt in the oppression of
women and blacks, in the utopian aspirations of
students, and in the exploitation of the peoples
of the Third World. Yet he viewed these contributions to political struggle as an enrichment
of the classical concept of socialism, rather than
its refutation. He constantly sought to rework
the philosophical foundations of socialism in
response to changing historical conditions.
His writings are unified by a concern with
philosophical anthropology and the emancipatory
resources of the aesthetic dimension of human
existence. His best-known essay, “The affirmative
character of culture” (1937), warns of the dangers of Culture becoming a substitute for true
happiness, and an accomplice to the mystification of the present, once it is separated from the
struggles of everyday life.
His life work may be divided into four main
periods:
1928–32 the attempt to utilize Heidegger’s
Being and Time (1927) as the phenomenological
basis for a Marxist philosophy of revolution: the
project for a “concrete philosophy” (Marcuse,
1928);
1932–41 the replacement of Heidegger’s Existentialism as the philosophical basis for a
reformed Marxism with the Humanism of
Marx’s newly discovered Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, and the development
of a general model of dialectical criticism out of
a rereading of Hegel (Marcuse, 1941);
1952–8 a radical interpretation of Freud’s theory of instincts which was to provide theoretical
inspiration for the sexual politics of the 1960s
(Marcuse, 1955);
1958–78 the analysis of industrial societies in
terms of the dominance of a narrowly technological

(and ultimately irrational) reason, the repression
of sensuality, and a consequent transformation in
the social bases of revolt (Marcuse, 1964; 1969;
1972).
Marcuse’s contribution to critical theory lies primarily in the series of concepts produced by his
Marxist reading of Freud – surplus repression, the
performance principle, and repressive desublimation
– and their application to the analysis of the
commodified cultural forms of US capitalism. His
later writings are increasingly concerned with the
transformation of humanity’s relationship to
nature and the role of a “new sensibility” in nurturing the instinctual bases of revolt. In this respect
they provide a crucial link between classical
Marxism, Psychoanalysis, and the ecological
and women’s liberation movements of the 1960s
and 1970s. His final work was a forthright
affirmation of the continuing critical potential of
autonomous artistic expression: The Permanence
of Art (translated into English in 1977).

`Marx, Karl Heinrich (1818–83) 
German
political, economic, philosophical theorist and
revolutionist. The influence of Marx’s materialistic conception of history, according to which
capitalism will preside over its own decline and
open the way for socialism, has been vast. Until
the collapse in 1991 of the Communist systems
of the USSR and Eastern Europe, a third of the
world’s population had been living under political
administrations claiming descent from Marx’s
ideas. His impact on the world of thought has
been equally extensive, embracing sociology,
philosophy, economics, and Cultural theory.

Marx’s thinking can be approached in terms of
philosophical, economic, and political strata. As
a philosopher, his development has its roots in
his early life. Born into a Jewish family where his
father had imbibed Enlightenment rationalist
principles, Marx was exposed to the ideas of
Voltaire, Lessing, and Racine. He studied law at
the University of Bonn and then Berlin. However, much of his time was spent in literary
composition, and for a while he was enamoured
of the Romanticism then in vogue. While these
influences were never fully to recede, they were
superseded by Marx’s seminal encounter with
the work of G.W.F. Hegel, whose dialectic shaped
the form of Marx’s earlier and arguably his later
thought. The dialectic did not comprise the
commonly cited triad of thesis, antithesis, and
synthesis: Hegel cited this formula only twice
in his entire work and Marx never used it. In
Hegel’s hands, the dialectic had both logical and
historical dimensions. Logically, it was a unifying
method of thought designed to overcome the
gulf between the human self and the world,
between subject and object, created cumulatively
by the hitherto developed social configurations of
which philosophy was the rational expression.
The three-stage dialectic formalized into a principle the imperative that thought was a process
rather than a mechanical tool, as it had been
in the hands of previous one-sided attempts to
understand the world, such as Materialism or
Empiricism. In the first stage an object was
apprehended in its sensuous immediacy; the
second stage adopted a broadened perspective
which saw the object as “externalized,” as having
no independent identity but constituted by its
manifold relations with its context. The third
stage, from a still wider standpoint, viewed the
object as a “mediated” unity, its true identity
now perceived as a principle of unity between
universal and particular, between essence and
appearance. In this way, “plant” could be viewed
as the unifying principle of its own developing
stages, bud, blossom, and fruit. Historically,
Hegel sees societies, from the Oriental world
through the Greek and Roman to the modern
German world, developing through successive
stages of the dialectic; this is a movement through
increasing self-conscious awareness that the
external world is a construction out of human subjectivity as well as a movement toward freedom,

435
by which he means the bourgeois economists
Smith, Say, and Ricardo. So Marx, following
Feuerbach, opposes the third stage of the dialectic, the negation of the negation, which restores
and justifies the state of alienation. In religious
and economic spheres Marx advocates two kinds
of Humanism: “atheism, being the supersession
of God, is the advent of theoretical humanism,
and communism, as the supersession of private
property, is . . . the advent of practical humanism.”
Hence for Marx the third stage of the dialectic is
practical, not something which can be resolved in
theory (Marx, 1959, pp. 127–43). Marx’s striking
equation of religion and private property as
expressions of alienation had been hinted at in
an earlier article on Hegel, where Marx regarded
religion as having an ideologically apologetic
and politically refractive function: “Religion is
the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a
heartless world . . . It is the opium of the people”
(Marx and Engels, 1957, p. 39).
This central insistence on the unity of theory
and practice lies at the core of Marx’s politics and
is summarized in his “Theses on Feuerbach”
(1845): “The philosophers have only interpreted
the world, in various ways; the point, however, is
to change it” (Marx and Engels, 1973, p. 95).
While Marx’s political views occur throughout his
writings, often occasioned by immediate political events, their pivotal notions of Civil society,
state, and Class are succintly expressed in The
German Ideology in 1846 (Marx and Engels, 1970)
and the Communist Manifesto in 1848 (Marx
and Engels, 1952). In the former, Marx further
develops his critique of Hegel’s dialectic into
what he calls the materialistic conception of
history, which is the broad foundation on which
he analyzes these political notions. The initial
premise of this conception is that man’s first historical act is the production of means to satisfy
his material needs; the fulfillment of these leads
to the production of new needs. The family, at
first the only social relation, is eventually unable
to accommodate these increased needs, which
arise from increased population. The production
of life, from both labor and procreation, is thus
both natural and social: a given mode of production is combined with a given stage of social
cooperation. Only after passing through these
historical moments, says Marx, can we speak of
human beings possessing “consciousness,” itself

Marx, Karl Heinrich

whereby society’s laws become more and more
rational while the individual sees in the law an
expression of his own free will. Hegel sees this as
a movement of Absolute Spirit from its initial
imprisonment in pure immediacy to its selfrealization as universal.
The importance of the dialectic for Marx stems
from his awareness that the “freedom” Hegel
speaks of is the freedom of the then revolutionary bourgeois class to bring down the economic
and political edifice of feudalism whose social
hierarchy rested on irrational theology and superstition: society could now be organized on
rational principles, a freer market economy, and
a human subject who saw his individual interests
enshrined in the general law. Hence the dialectic
provided a powerful political tool, one which
could negate a given state of affairs. It also furnished Marx with a model of history not only
driven by political and ideological conflict but
also where earlier phases were “sublated,” both
preserved and transcended, in their negation by
subsequent phases. For a while Marx associated
with the “Young Hegelians,” who attempted to
exploit the negative power of the dialectic in
political analysis. But Marx’s reading of French
socialists such as Proudhon, his concern with
immediate political issues, his exposure to
Feuerbach’s materialism, and his encounter with
Frederick Engels’s analyses of capitalism impelled
him to view the dialectic of history as motivated
by material forces. Hegel had correlated the historical period of the French Revolution, the
period marking a bourgeois rise toward hegemony,
with the second phase of the dialectic, the phase
of externalization or estrangement.
In the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts
of 1844 (1959; 1981), Marx’s essential argument
against Hegel is that this estrangement or Alienation in bourgeois society cannot be overcome
by mere thought: existence and essence can only
be harmonized “in a practical way, by means
of a revolution.” While Marx praises Hegel’s
dialectic inasmuch as it grasps the importance of
labor, by which man creates himself, he views it
as abstract because it is a “divine process,” first
negating religion and then restoring it. Marx
effectively equates the retention of religion by
Hegel’s dialectic with its retention of the ideal
of private property. Hence Marx views Hegel’s
standpoint as “that of modern political economy,”

Marx, Karl Heinrich

436
a “social product.” Hence the realms of Ideology,
politics, law, morality, religion, and Art are not
independent, but are an efflux of a people’s
material behavior: “Life is not determined by
consciousness, but consciousness by life” (Marx
and Engels, 1970, pp. 47–51).
This model of superstructure and economic base
furnishes the form of Marx’s analyses of state,
class, and ideology. The foundational context of
these analyses is the history of the division of
labor. Marx traces various stages of this history,
affirming that they are effectively different forms
of ownership. At first the division of labor takes
an elementary form in tribal ownership, where the
social structure is limited to an extended family.
Ancient communal and state ownership sees the
union of tribes into a city; as immovable private
property evolves and its concentration begins
in early Rome, the division of labor becomes
more developed, generating a conflict of interests
between town and country. Class relations between
citizens and slaves are now completely developed. In feudalism, the directly producing class
is not the slaves but the enserfed peasantry. The
urban counterpart of feudal landownership is
corporative property and organization of trades.
The need for bourgeois association against the
nobility and for communal markets led to the formation of guilds, while the accumulated capital
and stable numbers of craftsmen generated the
relation of journeyman and apprentice, which
yielded an urban hierarchy similar to that in
the country. In general terms, Marx argues that
division of labor is an index of the development
of production. It leads to the separation of
industrial and commercial from agricultural labor,
hence a conflict of interests between town and
country. It then effects a separation of individual
and community interests (Marx and Engels, 1970,
pp. 43–6). Moreover, the division of labor which
first manifested itself in the sexual act appears
eventually in its true shape as a division of
material and mental labor; this is the point at
which “pure” theory becomes possible, a point
which Marx acknowledges, however, with some
qualification.
Marx cites three crucial consequences of the
social division of labour, first, the unequal distribution of labor and its products, and hence
private property. The latent slavery in the family,
says Marx, is the first property. He goes so far as

to equate division of labor and private property,
under the relation of product and activity. The
second consequence is the state. The division of
labor implying a contradiction between individual or family and communal interest, the latter
assumes an independent form as the state, as
an “illusory communal life” divorced from the
real interests of both individual and community.
It is based especially on classes, one of which
dominates the others. It follows that all struggles
within the state are disguised versions of the
struggle between classes. As Marx later declaims
in The Communist Manifesto in 1848: “The history
of all hitherto existing society is the history of
class struggles” (Marx and Engels, 1952, p. 40).
The class which is struggling for mastery must gain
political power in order to represent its interest
as the general interest (Marx and Engels, 1952,
52–3). Here is the germ of Marx’s concept of
ideology: the class which is the ruling material
force in society is also the ruling intellectual force.
Having at its disposal the means of production,
it is empowered to disseminate its ideas in the
realms of law, morality, religion, and art, as
possessing universal verity. Dominant ideas of
the aristocracy such as honor and loyalty were
replaced after bourgeois ascendancy with ideas of
freedom and equality, whose infrastructure comprised class economic imperatives (Marx and
Engels, 1970, pp. 64–5). As Marx states in The
Communist Manifesto, the bourgeoisie “creates a
world after its own image.” The modern state, then,
“is but a committee for managing the common
affairs of the whole bourgeoisie” (Marx and
Engels, 1952, pp. 45–7).
This conception of the state in part embodies
Marx’s rejection of Hegel’s view of the connection between civil society and the state. Hegel
had characterized civil society as the sphere of
personal and economic relations between men, as
opposed to the political institutions which formalize these relations. Civil society is effectively
a stage of mutual competition between private
interests. Hegel had argued that such conflicting
interests would be transcended and harmonized
by the state. Marx disagrees: in his articles
“On the Jewish question” and “Contribution to
the critique of Hegel’s philosophy of right,” he
employs Feuerbach’s characterization of man as
a “species-being,” while stressing nevertheless
the social basis of humanity to argue that mere

437
The contradiction between these two types of
value emerges in the commodification of labor
power itself, which generates the class conflict
between labor and capital. Also instrumental in
this conflict is what Marx called surplus value,
whereby labor power as embodied in production
is incompletely compensated: the worker, putting
in eight hours daily, might be paid for the value
of the products generated by only four hours’
work.
Marx saw such economic exploitation as
underlying the ultimate downfall of capitalism: his
various chapters in the first volume of Capital
describe the “greed” on the part of the capitalists
for surplus labor, their attempts to intensify
labor and profit by both technology and control
of resources by imperial expansion, as well as
increasingly to centralize capital in the hands of
fewer and fewer owners. In an apocalyptic passage,
he states:
along with the constantly diminishing number of
the magnates of capital . . . grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation;
but with this too grows the revolt of the workingclass, a class always increasing in numbers,
and disciplined, united, organised by the very
mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of capital becomes a
fetter upon the mode of production, which has
sprung up and flourished along with, and under
it. Centralisation of the means of production
and socialisation of labour at last reach a point
where they become incompatible with their
capitalist integument. This integument is burst
asunder. The knell of capitalist private property
sounds. The expropriators are expropriated.

Significantly, Marx sees this as part of a dialectical
process moving from feudalism through capitalism to the final stage of communism, whose
essential feature is common ownership of land
and the means of production: “capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of
Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of
negation” (Marx, 1954, p. 715). Hence the capitalist world represents the second phase of the
dialectic, negating feudalism. Communism is the
“negation of the negation,” whereby the contradiction between private property and socialized
production is resolved by the establishment of
socialized property. Equally, the contradictions

Marx, Karl Heinrich

political emancipation, represented by publicly
institutionalizing individuals’ private interests in
the state, “leaves intact the world of private interest” and must give way to human emancipation,
which is not directed by class but universal interests. The proletariat can redeem itself only by a
total redemption of humanity: “This dissolution
of society, as a particular class, is the proletariat.”
Hence, for Marx, civil society is the basis of the
state, not vice versa; the latter, representing merely
particular class interests, cannot overcome the
conflictual nature of the former without abolishing itself (Marx, 1963, pp. 58, 16).
The third consequence of the division of labor
is what Marx calls “estrangement” or “alienation”
of social activity. Not only does division of labor
force upon each person a particular sphere of
activity whereby his “own deed becomes an alien
power opposed to him,” but also the social power
or “multiplied productive force” as determined by
division of labour appears to individuals, because
their cooperation is forced, as “an alien force
existing outside them” which develops independently of their will. “How otherwise,” asks Marx,
“does it happen that trade . . . rules the whole
world through the relation of supply and demand
. . . ?” (Marx and Engels, 1970, pp. 54–5).
This question, far from rhetorical, yields a
broad avenue into Marx’s economics, which
can receive only cursory treatment here. As with
his philosophy and politics, Marx’s economic
views, worked out largely in the Grundrisse, a huge
manuscript unpublished in his lifetime, and
expressed in volume I of Capital (1867), derive
in one sense from his inversion of Hegel’s dialectic, expressed by Marx in his statement that with
Hegel the dialectic “is standing on its head. It
must be turned right side up again, if you would
discover the rational kernel within the mystical
shell” (Marx, 1954, p. 29). Implied here is an
insistence on labor as the foundation of economic
life. The bourgeois economists Smith and Ricardo
had expressed the labor theory of value, whereby
an object’s value was measured by the amount of
labor it incarnated. Developing their distinction
between use value and exchange value, Marx
insisted that a commodity needed to be of use in
order to command the power of exchange with
other commodities or money; this power, however, was not a reflection of use value but rather
of market conditions (Marx, 1954, pp. 43–8).

Marx, Karl Heinrich

438
within the self, hitherto alienated from its own
labor, as well as those between individual and
communal interests, are abolished.
In his “Preface to A Contribution to the Critique
of Political Economy,” Marx had expressed this
economic dialectic by saying that it was when “the
material productive forces of society” came into
conflict with “the existing relations of production”
that historical upheavals resulted (Marx, 1976,
p. 3). In The German Ideology Marx suggests that
the estrangement which governs the second phase
of the dialectic, the phase of bourgeois domination, can be abolished by revolution, given two
practical premises: it must have rendered most
men propertyless and also have produced, in
contrast, an existing world of wealth and culture
(Marx and Engels, 1970, p. 56). However, he also
emphasizes the universality or world-historical
nature of this conflict: such revolution presupposes not only highly developed productive
capacities, but also that individuals have become
enslaved under a power alien to them – the
world market. Marx accepted that the struggle
between classes might begin in specific nations but
must inevitably be conducted as an international
struggle, given that the bourgeois mode of production dictated constant expansion of markets
and the coercion of all nations, “on pain of
extinction,” into the bourgeois economic mold
(Marx and Engels, 1952, p. 47).
In the realm of literature and Art, Marx’s
views are somewhat piecemeal and inconclusive,
generating a rich variety of attempts by Marxist
critics to assemble his insights into coherent theories. A nucleus of elements can be distinguished
as the common starting point of most Marxist
theories. First, art is a commodity and like other
commodities can be understood only in the fullness of its connections with ideology, historical
class conflict, and economic substructure. Second,
art is one aspect of man’s self-creation through
labor. It is part of the process whereby an
“objective” world is created out of a collective
human subjectivity. Third, language is not a
self-enclosed system of relations but must be
understood as social practice, as deeply rooted in
material conditions as any other practice (Marx
and Engels, 1970, p. 51). Having said this, both
Marx and Engels appear to have granted a relative autonomy to art, acknowledging that there
was not a relation of simple reflection between

art and its material substructure (Marx, 1977,
p. 359). See Marxism and marxist criticism.
Is Marx dead? Can we, finally, consign his
work to historical and political obsolescence?
After all, have not socialism and Communism
failed? Has Marxism not proven its inability to
be realized in practice? Have not the remaining
socialist states in the world been forced to
initiate capitalist enterprise so as to jolt into life
their barren economies? Have not economic and
personal freedom, not to mention democracy,
won the day? It is surely time for Marxism to
acknowledge that it speaks from beyond the grave.
Perhaps the greatest irony in all this triumphalism is that the collapse of Communism can
best be explained in Marxist terms: this entails
partly the recognition that most of what has
passed for “communism” has had but remote
connections with the doctrines of Marx or his followers. Moreover, Marx’s critique of capitalism
was dialectical. He regarded capitalist society
as an unprecedented historical advance from
centuries of benighted feudalism. The bourgeois
emphasis on reason, practicality, on technological enterprise in mastering the world, on ideals
of rational law and justice, individual freedom, and
democracy were all hailed by Marx as historical
progress. His point was not that communism
would somehow displace capitalism in its entirety
but that it would grow out of capitalism and
realize its ideals of freedom and democracy. For
example, Marx shrewdly points out that the
“individual” in capitalist society is effectively the
bourgeois owner of property; individual freedom
is merely economic freedom, the freedom to
buy and sell. The constitution and the laws are
entirely weighted in favor of large business interests and owners of property. Private property,
Marx points out, is already abolished for the ninetenths of the population in capitalist society who
do not possess it. The labor of this vast majority,
being commodified, is as subject to the vicissitudes
of the market as any other commodity.
One of the main sins of capitalism, according
to Marx, is that it reduces all human relations
to commercial relations. Even the family cannot escape such commodification: Marx states
that, for the bourgeois man, the wife is reduced
to a mere instrument of production. Moreover, once the exploitation of the laborer by the
manufacturer has finished, then he is set upon,

439
and Engels must enter into sustained dialogue and
possible compromise with both the apologists
of this economic system and those espousing
humanitarian causes within it. Nevertheless, as long
as human poverty, immiseration, and oppression
exist, whether under the banner of liberalism,
communism or religious fundamentalism, the
arguments of Marx will retain their motivational
foundation and their relevance in human affairs.

`Marxism and Marxist criticism 
Founded by
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, in a complex
synthesis/supersession of German philosophy,
English political economy, and French utopian
socialism, Marxism comprises:
(i)

a general theory of human history, postulating the ultimately determinant role therein
of successive “economic formations” or
modes of production; and
(ii) a particular theory of the development,
reproduction, and transformation of the
capitalist mode of production, identifying
one of its principal antagonistic social classes
– the proletariat – as the potential historical
agency of a transition to communism.
From the early 1850s Marx devoted himself to
the elaboration of (ii), expounded in the three
volumes of the unfinished Capital (1867–95). The
closest approximation to a systematic account by
him of (i) appears in the enormously influential
1859 Preface to A Contribution to the Critique

Marxism and Marxist criticism

says Marx, by other segments of the bourgeoisie:
the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker.
In bourgeois society “capital is independent
and has individuality, while the living person is
dependent and has no individuality” (Marx and
Engels, 1952, pp. 51, 53, 65–70). As an internal
critique of the tendencies of capitalism and its
crises, Marxism is uniquely incisive. Without the
influence of Marxism as a body of thought, the
claims of the law to be eternal, of the bourgeoisie
to represent the interests of the entire nation, and
of individuality and freedom to be universal,
would have encountered little more than academic
challenge. The idea of the present as a historical phase, with roots in the past and branches
in the future, would be confined to books rather
than being a matter of long-term political practice. Moreover, the vocabulary and concepts of
Marxism have exercised a decisive and formative
influence on other modern theories, both radical
and reactionary: feminism, Deconstruction,
Structuralism, Existentialism, and New historicism all owe some debt to Marxist thought
and have striven to develop a dialogue with it.
Even after the collapse of the so-called Communist bloc, many of Marx’s ideas can still be seen
to be operative: that capitalism would be driven
to engulf the entire world, penalizing nations
which resisted; and that, despite the protests of
conservative sociologists to the contrary, societies everywhere have indeed become polarized in
terms of capital and labor. It is rapidly becoming
a cliché, with no grounding in truth, that most
of the population in Western capitalist nations
is now middle class: Marx said that even those
owning land and property could belong to the proletariat, since their mortgage liability meant that
they were not truly owners of either. Moreover,
to equate the success of capitalism with the failure of socialism is to misconceive their relation
as one of outright opposition rather than as a
blooming of humanity from a self-exhausting
machine. Marxism serves as a perpetual reminder
that poverty, illiteracy, crime, political oppression,
and the stifling of mass human potential are
neither to be accepted as inevitable nor to be
remedied by individual or group acts of good will.
They are structural phenomena with roots in a
given economic system and must be addressed as
such. Given the political climate of the world at
present, it may be that the arguments of Marx

of Political Economy, with its celebrated Base
and superstructure topography. In it the
“base” – the “economic structure of society” – is
accorded explanatory primacy over the “legal
and political superstructure,” and the “forms of
social consciousness” or “ideological forms”
(aesthetic included) said to “correspond” to it, in
any Social formation.
An account of cultural practices was thus
inscribed in principle in the “materialist conception of history,” as a subset of the theory of
“ideological forms”; it was not, however, developed in the work of the founders, who nevertheless
ventured some relevant obiter dicta on the subject. Seeking to refute mechanistic constructions
and applications of historical materialism, which
converted the base/superstructure model into a
Procrustean bed, in a late series of letters Engels
argued that the explanatory claims of the theory
were compatible with evidence for the autonomy
of ideological forms. Although the product of
historically specific material and social conditions,
literary works, for example, were thus not the
mere passive reflection in artistic form of some
real content, which explained them as a cause does
its effects. At the same time, in their specifically
aesthetic judgments Marx and Engels indicated a
pronounced affinity with literary realism, encapsulated by Engels as “the truthful rendering of
typical characters under typical circumstances,”
and exemplified, notwithstanding his reactionary
political allegiances, by the fiction of Balzac.
These propositions set the terms and constitute
the enduring, interrelated cruces, of aesthetic
controversy within Marxism and against it: the
base/superstructure nexus, and the attendant
perils of mechanical determinism and economic
reductionism; the differentia specifica (if any) of
art vis-à-vis Ideology (for example, art as the
transcendence or the transcription of ideology);
realism and anti-realism; literature and politics (the
themes of “partisanship” or “commitment”); the
question of literary value (“eternal,” as in Marx’s
Hellenism, or mutable?).
Following Mulhern (1992, pp. 2–17), the
intellectual history of Marxism and Marxist criticism can be conveniently divided into three
overlapping phases:
(i)

Classical Marxism – the “scientific” Weltanschauung systematized by Engels in the late

1870s and 1880s, extended by the leading
thinkers of the Second (Social-Democratic)
International (for example, Kautsky and
Plekhanov) and the Third (Communist)
International (for example, Lenin and
Trotsky), and then debased into the
orthodox doctrine of global Communism
down to its implosion a century later;
(ii) Western Marxism – the philosophical revolt
against the Positivism of (i), pioneered
by Korsch and Lukács in the early 1920s
and continued, in a rich diversity of forms,
by Gramsci in Italy, Benjamin and the
Frankfurt school in Germany, Lefebvre,
Sartre, and Goldmann in France, and
arguably Williams in Britain, into the
1960s;
(iii) “critical classicism” – a “materialist” reaction
against the declared or alleged Hegelianism of (ii), associated with the schools of
Della Volpe and especially Althusser,
which climaxed in the 1970s, whereafter,
in a reversal of critical alliances, certain of
its polemical themes converged with Poststructuralism in a critique of historical
materialism which commands widespread
assent today.
Given Marx’s abstention, the task of producing a general philosophical statement of
Marxism as a conception of history fell to
Engels. His Anti-Dühring of 1878 (Engels, 1939),
sanctioned by Marx and received as the summa
of their “world outlook,” subsumed it under the
metaphilosophy of “modern materialism,” the
putative “science of the general laws of motion
and development of nature, human society and
thought.” A typical late nineteenth-century enterprise and a hybrid, despite itself, of Hegelianism
and positivism, “dialectical materialism” as it
became known aspired “to devise a scheme of
knowledge unified in method and integrated in
its results, capable of mastering the evolutionary
and structural ascent from protein to poetry in
a single cognitive operation” (Mulhern, 1992,
p. 6). Under this rubric, the succeeding generation of theorists – whether Mehring in The Lessing
Legend (1893) or Plekhanov in Art and Social
Life (1912) – modestly began the extension of
Marxism to the aesthetic domain, initiating a
variant of the sociology of literature.

441
Stalinist bugbear of most Marxist criticism of
note thereafter.
As Mulhern (1992, p. 9) has observed, “[t]he
long reign of party dogmatism, through the
decades of Stalinism proper and beyond, was
also a golden age of Marxist aesthetics.” Formed,
and scarred, by the defeat of revolution in the West
and its degeneration in the East, the heterodox,
minority currents of Western Marxism took varying degrees of distance from the bureaucratic
breviary of “dialectical and historical materialism” (see Jameson, 1971). However otherwise
heterogeneous, they were united in two fundamental respects: by a philosophical critique of the
“scientism” of orthodox Marxism, initiated in
Lukács’s History and Class Consciousness (1923),
and resumed in Gramsci’s Prison Notebooks, via
a revindication of Historicism and Humanism;
and by an overwhelming preoccupation with
cultural analysis, especially of literature and art,
attested by the culmination of Lukács’s career
in his Aesthetik (1963), Adorno’s in Aesthetic
Theory (1970a), and Sartre’s in a three-volume
study of Flaubert, The Family Idiot (1971–2).
Paradoxically, perhaps, the founder of Western
Marxism – the loyal Communist, Lukács –
became the main philosophical ornament of the
protocols of socialist realism for the duration of
anti-fascist Popular Frontism (1935–9), when
dictatorial vice paid cultural homage to bourgeoisdemocratic virtue. Lukács’s dogmatic advocacy
of literary realism, against modernism and naturalism alike, incited a series of complex, multilateral exchanges – between Bloch and Brecht,
Benjamin and Adorno, covering the full range
of perennial and conjunctural issues – which
forms one of the central debates in modern
Aesthetics (Bloch et al., 1977).
Despite his political conformism, and notwithstanding his exaggerated stance in the 1930s –
the equation of modernism with irrationalism;
the identification of the latter with fascism –
Lukács’s aesthetic options remained consistent
throughout his career, from the pre-Marxist
Theory of the Novel (1916), via The Historical
Novel (1937) and Studies in European Realism
(1950), to The Meaning of Contemporary Realism
(1958), with its characteristic antithesis between
Mann and Kafka. His exclusive sponsorship of
realism in fiction, its paradigmatic instances and
classical models furnished by Balzac and Tolstoy,

Marxism and Marxist criticism

In 1908 the poet Blok had warned the Russian
intelligentsia, “History, that same history which,
they say, can be reduced simply to political economy, has placed a real bomb on the table.” Nine
years later, amid the convulsions of the 1914–
18 war, it exploded in Petrograd. Subsequent
Marxist thought about Culture and Art was
fundamentally inflected by the vicissitudes of
revolutionary construction and retrenchment in
the Soviet Union. Lenin’s prior defense of the
“classical heritage” found itself under challenge
from the voluntarism of the Proletkult, intent upon
making a tabula rasa of the prerevolutionary
past. Repudiating any such nihilistic prospectus, Trotsky’s Literature and Revolution (1923)
simultaneously rejected the Canons of Russian
formalism – the most original critical enterprise
of these turbulent years, seeded by linguistics
and futurist poetics, which theorized literature
as the signification and Defamiliarization
(rather than the imitation or reflection) of social
reality. Contra Plekhanov’s conception of literature as “the mirror of social life,” Trotsky
characterized it as “a deflection, a changing and
a transformation of reality, in accordance with the
peculiar laws of art.” But for him Shklovsky,
Eichenbaum, Tynyanov, Jakobson and co. were,
in their exclusive exploration of generic literariness, “followers of St John” and “underlabourers
of the device.”
Formalism achieved a belated, remarkably
productive rapprochement with Marxism towards
the end of the 1920s, in the postformalist current represented by Bakhtin. The fate of his
classic work on Rabelais – written in 1940, but
not published until 1965 – symbolizes its brutal
interruption. For by now the consolidation of
Stalinism, the lethal political instrumentalization
of Marxism – as decidedly illiterate as it was
determinedly autarkic – and the intensification
of cultural controls in the Soviet state and international Communist movement alike, spelt the
doom of intellectual experimentation. Socialist
realism was promulgated by Zhdanov in 1934
as the official aesthetic doctrine of the USSR.
A noxious blend of cultural traditionalism and
political voluntarism, assigning artists the role of
“engineers of the human soul,” its prescriptions
– partinost ’ (partisanship), narodnost’ (popularity), klassovost’ (class character of art), etc.
– mandated a line of unrelieved crudity, the

Marxism and Marxist criticism

442
was rooted in an evolutionist and expressivist
literary history. This plotted the decline of the
novel after 1848 into the twin bêtes noires of
naturalism (for example, Zola), taxed with “objectivism,” and Formalism (for example, Musil),
indicted for “subjectivism,” against the European
bourgeoisie’s renunciation of its revolutionary
class vocation. The Lukacsian conception of the
novel as an “intensive totality,” reproducing the
“extensive totality” of society and thereby constituting a “reflection of objective reality” (1958,
p. 101), presupposed epistemological realism
(more specifically, a correspondence theory of
truth in which narrative Discourse was the transparent signifier of the essential reality disclosed
by historical materialism).
The divergent countercritiques elicited by this
doctrine of literary realism shared common
ground with it: namely subscription to a cognitivist theory of art as a means of understanding
historical reality. For Adorno, as for Lukács,
specific forms of art possessed this privileged
capacity intrinsically; and he was thus prompted
to emulate his opponent’s project of elaborating
a Marxist version of a non-Marxist ideology of the
aesthetic (albeit a modernist rather than realist
one). For Brecht, by contrast, intervening in the
controversy as a “producer,” adjudging Lukács
and his cothinkers “enemies of production” and
accusing them of “formalism” for their valorization of the conventions of the nineteenth-century
novel, realism was a political goal whose formal
means were historically variable. Authentic realism
was apprised of the fact that “[r]eality changes;
in order to represent it, modes of representation
must also change” (Bloch et al., 1977, p. 82). His
own “epic theatre,” memorably vindicated by
his friend Benjamin (1966), centrally entailed
“unmasking the prevailing view of things,” to
be achieved by anti-naturalist devices which produced the requisite Alienation effect in the
audience (compare the Russian Formalists’ notion
of Estrangement).
Articulating a Marxist Kulturkritik of mass/
Popular culture, Adorno had as little time for
Brecht’s poetics as he did for Lukács’s politics.
Suffused with the “instrumental rationality” of
the natural sciences, and sustained by the “mass
deception” of the Culture industry, the
advanced liberal capitalism depicted in Adorno and
Horkheimer’s Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944)

was a quasi-totalitarian “administered universe”
for which the velleities of aesthetic realism and
political commitment held no terrors. Modernist art, in which Lukács, wedded to “reflection”
theory, could discern only a decadent caricature
of actuality, secreted “the negative knowledge of
the actual world” (Bloch et al., 1977, p. 160). The
last imperiled refuge of “negation,” its images
embodied a contradiction and critique of the
abstract exchange value which had invaded every
sphere of the totality, staging a refusal of reconciliation with a degraded social reality. The value
of works of art precisely consisted of their constitutive, irreducible formality. If not offering une
promesse de bonheur, “As eminently constructed
and produced objects, [they] point to a practice
from which they abstain: the creation of a just life”
(Bloch et al., 1977, p. 194). Reproving Sartre’s 1948
manifesto, What is literature? Adorno insisted,
“This is not a time for political art, but politics
has migrated into autonomous art.”
The postwar florescence of Critical theory,
not only in Germany, but also in America where
Marcuse remained after 1945, relaying its
distinctive concerns in One-Dimensional Man
(1964) and completing The Aesthetic Dimension
(1977) shortly before his death, renders it the
dominant tradition within Western Marxism. In
France, meanwhile, the presiding theorists were
Sartre, engaged with de Beauvoir and others
in the ambitious synthesis of historical materialism and Existentialism which issued in
the Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960); and
Goldmann, whose Genetic Structuralism,
unveiled in The Hidden God (1956), reclaimed
the writings of the early Lukács and employed
the epistemology of the psychologist Piaget.
Eschewing the former’s dogmatism, he did not
avoid his schematism in a theory of literary texts
as the artistic transposition of the “world view”
of the social class or group to which their
authors belonged.
This was the Marxist philosophical setting in
which Althusser, against the grain of post-Stalin
Communism, advanced an “anti-humanist” and
“anti-historicist” recasting of the substance of
historical materialism. Antithetical to the putative
Hegelianism of Western Marxism, charged with
Essentialism, Althusserianism was simultaneously hostile to the “economism” of orthodox
Soviet Marxism. Displacing the base/superstructure

443
Williams, Eagleton’s analysis nevertheless queried
the existence of an invariably subversive text/
ideology relationship and ventured a “transitive”
theory of differential literary value. Rejecting,
like the later Macherey, the received question of
philosophical aesthetics – what is literature? –
Eagleton drafted a new agenda: a theory of literary
reproduction/consumption.
Where classical Marxism after Marx had
generally subscribed to scientific positivism and
artistic realism, and much Western Marxism
to anti-scientism and anti-realism, this broadly
Althusserian phase witnessed a distinctive conjunction of science and modernism. The synthesis of historical materialism, psychoanalysis,
and Semiotics attempted by the maoisant Tel
Quel (Kristeva et al.) involved a recovery of
prewar Russian and German figures and debates.
Its cross-Channel transfer to Screen (Heath and
co.) issued in a single-minded avant-gardism,
affixing ideological valences to aesthetic forms
– crudely, modernist/open/oppositional versus
realist/closed/dominant (see Coward and Ellis,
1977). Such inversion of Lukacsian filiations,
widely diffused after 1968, consummated the rupture with realist modes of artistic representation
which, in generating the illusion of a transcription of social reality, supposedly reproduced the
fixed subject-positions of the dominant ideologies
of capitalism and Patriarchy.
The confluence of conventionalist epistemology, inferred from Saussurean linguistics, and
aesthetic modernism, identified with Joyce in
fiction, Brecht in drama, or Godard in cinema,
effected not only a generalized displacement of
epistemological realism, but a counterposition
of avant-garde to popular culture. Elsewhere,
in the developing Cultural materialism of
Williams (1977), the research of the Centre for
contemporary cultural studies, directed by
Hall, and a richly varied Feminist criticism (cf.
Mitchell), different kinds of problematization
of the received object (“literature”) and discipline (“criticism”) were conducted. Challenging
the traditional Canon, these both expanded
and equalized the corpus, while diversifying the
modes of its analysis.
Under the combined impact of intrinsic theoretical difficulties and extrinsic political histories,
the ecumenical alliance between historical materialism and “structuralism” broke down towards

Marxism and Marxist criticism

topography, in For Marx (Althusser, 1965b) and
Reading “Capital” (Althusser and Balibar, 1965)
Althusser and his collaborators (for example,
Balibar) reconceptualized the social totality
as a complex, Decentered structure of
irreducible “practices,” entering into processes of
Overdetermination, while enjoying Relative
autonomy and “specific effectivity,” determined
only in the “last instance” by the economy
(Althusser, 1965, pp. 87–127). To execute this
comprehensive reconstruction they turned, under
the banner of a “return to Marx,” to Freudian
Psychoanalysis à la Lacan and the linguistics
of Saussure, sealing a de facto “triple alliance”
between them and Marxism for the Parisian season of Structuralism. Accordingly Althusser,
while adamantly reasserting the scientific status
of Marxism, implicitly retracted its pretension to
constitute an autarkic world view.
Althusser’s own prouncements on art, including some arresting reflections on Brechtian
dramaturgy (1965, 129–51), accorded a signal
cognitive privilege to it, alongside science, via-àvis an otherwise ubiquitous ideology, which was
theorized as “imaginary relations” and rendered
coterminous with “lived experience.” His pupil
Macherey systematized these proposals in his
sketch “for a theory of literary production” (1966).
Insisting upon the autonomy of literary texts,
Macherey conceived them as the product of a
labor of artistic transformation upon ideological
raw materials, a determinate material practice in
and on ideology. The effect of literary form was
to “produce” ideology in such a way as to disclose
its relations with its real conditions of existence
and thereby supply an “implicit critique” of it. The
specificity of literature lay, then, in its subversion
of the “necessary illusions” of ideology. And the
task of its analyst, renouncing evaluation and
interpretation, was to provide a knowledge of its
peculiar modalities.
As it affected both the substance and the status
of historical materialism, Althusserianism had
an enormous impact upon Marxist Cultural
and critical theory, largely defining the terms of
debate for a decade or more. In the anglophone
world, where it was received concurrently with
the schools of Western Marxism (largely via the
New Left Review), it inspired the ambitious programme of Eagleton (1976). Directed against

the end of the 1970s. Variously drawing upon the
Genealogy of Foucault, the Deconstruction
of Derrida, or the Postmodernism proper of
Lyotard and Baudrillard, and mediated, for
example, by the discourse theory of Laclau,
varieties of “post-Marxism” (compare Bennett,
1990) emerged in its wake. These subjected
Althusserian Marxism to concerted criticism for
its alleged epistemological dogmatism, rejecting
the science/ideology distinction as a repressive ruse
of Power; and class reductionism, repudiating the
category of the totality in the name of difference. Under the rubric of Cultural studies,
and deflecting the slogans of “materialism” and
“anti-humanism” against Althusser, there crystallized “a new canon of subversion, the counterenlightenment thematics of ‘post-structuralism’”
(Mulhern, 1992, pp. 15–16), of which Nietzsche,
following the death of strange gods, was the
tutelary deity.
Preaching (if scarcely practicing) a euphoric
nescience, this postlapsarian critical formation
is, by virtue of its very perspectivism and relativism, politically progressive in self-conception.
Ironically, however, its populist culturalism
reverses the evaluative signs, but reproduces the
problematic, of Kulturkritik, subordinating the
narrowly political to the expansively cultural.
As deployed in much colonial discourse theory,
its strategies, implemented in an indiscriminate
running polemic against Marxism and the “metaphysics,” essentialism, ethnocentrism, etc., to
which it is assimilated, have recently provoked
a confident countercritique (Ahmad, 1992). But
pending the next revolution of the wheel of
fashion in academic “theory,” it represents the
dominant consensus of contemporary anglophone
“radical” criticism; while Marxism, experiencing the gravest crisis in its crisis-ridden history,
is generally perceived as discredited. Whether
this amounts to just arbitration of respective
reputations is another matter. Certainly, AngloAmerican “post-Marxism” has produced no
oeuvre of comparable range and power to that of
a Williams, from Culture and Society (1958) to The
Politics of Modernism (1989), or a Jameson, from
Marxism and Form (1971) to Postmodernism
(1991). And it is probably safe to conclude, in
the words of Freud, that “a contradiction is not
a refutation; an innovation not necessarily an
advance.”

`Marxist-Feminist Literature Collective
(1975–77) An informal network of women
students and teachers in adult and higher education, which met regularly in London from 1975
to late 1977. The MFLC was a reading group
focusing on classic Marxist writings on literature as well as the new French theories (often
distributed freshly translated, in typescript, to
members): from Marx, Saussure, and Macherey
to Lacan, Kristeva, and Irigaray.
For the Sociology of Literature Conference at
the University of Essex in 1977 the collective
wrote a collaborative paper entitled “Women’s
Writing: Jane Eyre, Shirley, Villette, Aurora Leigh,”
and read it, polyphonically, in a line of nine
women across the lecture room. The paper has
been reprinted and cited frequently, and is seen
as a key document in early British socialistfeminist Literary criticism. The collective met
for a short time after the Essex Conference; its
members have since stayed in contact and have
gone on to publish Feminist criticism in Britain
and the United States.

`materialism 
Materialism has occupied a wide
range of forms, common to which is the central
assertion of the primacy of matter over mind or
spirit in any explanation of the world. Strong materialism holds that reality consists exclusively of
material things and their varying combinations.
Weaker forms of materialism acknowledge the
importance, albeit secondary, of mental operations.
Given this insistence on interpreting reality in
material terms, the history of materialism has
exhibited both an affiliation with the natural
sciences and a persistent antagonism toward
explanation of events in terms of spiritual or
supernatural agency.
Though its roots stretch back through the sixth
and fifth centuries bc to Thales and Parmenides,
materialism proper begins with the fifth-century
thinker Democritus (on whom Marx was to
write his doctoral dissertation) and his teacher
Leucippus. They viewed the world as consisting

exclusively of an infinite number of material
atoms whose interaction unceasingly yielded new
combinations. King Lear’s warning to Cordelia that
“Nothing will come of nothing” derives from
this materialist philosophy, which holds equally
that nothing can be destroyed. Hence the notions
of a created world and supernatural agency
are precluded. In the same century Empedocles
attempted a materialistic explanation of organic
life, constructing the influential theory of the four
elements, earth, air, fire, and water. He believed
that the universe evolved cyclically through the
harmony and discord of these elements.
The anti-religious motivation of materialism
resurged strongly in the philosophy of Epicurus
(342–270 bc) who, notwithstanding his vulgarized reputation, preached an Ethics based on
material reality and freedom from superstition.
The Roman poet Lucretius (c.100–c.55 bc) saw
Epicurus as the precursory champion of his own
cause in De Rerum Natura which began from the
tenet: “Nothing can ever be created by divine
power out of nothing” (Lucretius, 1951, p. 31).
Lucretius attempted a “scientific” materialistic
explanation of sensation, mental life, society, and
cosmology, denying both human immortality
and the existence of the soul.
Apart from its sporadic and partial emergence
in figures such as the scholastic Duns Scotus
(c.1266–1308), materialism was largely held in
abeyance from Classical times through the Middle
Ages by the Church-sanctioned domination of
the theology of Augustine and the Aristotelian–
Christian synthesis of Aquinas. While the French
materialist Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655) sought to
displace Aristotle with Epicurus in this synthesis,
he was still working within a Christian providential framework. It was in the work of Thomas
Hobbes (1588–1679) that materialism found a genuine rebirth. Hobbes applied the assumptions of
seventeenth-century science – in particular those
of Galileo and Newton – to all areas of inquiry.
His view of the universe as corporeal and in
motion also encompassed man, who was effectively
a machine in movement. Elevated to paramount
importance in Hobbes’s materialism was the
operation of causality; while he accepted the Final
Causality of the “Supreme Being”, his conception
of God as corporeal was a far cry from the God of
Christianity. It was on a materialist as opposed
to the prevailing theological basis that Hobbes

`masculinity 
The Gender that is culturally
constructed upon an anatomically male Body.
Masculinity defines identifiable sets of behavior,
forms of speech, and styles of bodily comportment
that serve to keep men dominant in a patriarchal
society. In most cultures, masculinity is the
dominant term in a Binary opposition which
subordinates Femininity. Theorists of Culture
and society insist that masculinity cannot be
discussed with any measure of success without
specifying it as a phenomenon in relation to
Class, “Race,” generation, region, and sexuality.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a large number of academic studies of masculinity appeared,
many of which were authored by heterosexual
men who wished to undermine male domination. Their project in part shared the aims of
Feminist criticism and Gay politics. Several
of these men named themselves male feminists,
although some of their female critics claimed that
feminist identity and politics were the preserve of
women alone.

materialism

constructed his political theory. Hobbes’s “pure”
materialism was motivated in part by his rejection
of Descartes’s dualism between mind and body.
French materialism appeared on the world
historical stage during the epoch of Enlightenment, articulated by such figures as Denis
Diderot (1713–84), Julien de La Mettrie (1709–
51), and Paul Heinrich Dietrich d’Holbach,
whose prototypical work Système de la nature
appeared in 1770. While Diderot’s eventual
materialistic and atheistic outlook was the result
of his intellectual journey through deism and
immanent pantheism, La Mettrie and d’Holbach
were less equivocal in grounding explanations
of nature, including human behavior, in physical causes and undermining the theological
paraphernalia of the immortal soul and spiritual
agency. The increasing definition of physics,
chemistry, and biology as empirical sciences in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as well as as
the historical success of Darwinism, gave materialistic explanations of the world an increasingly
authoritative basis to which their claims could
be referred. Even thinkers not strictly classifiable as materialist, such as Voltaire, Locke, and
Hume, owed the possibility of their respective
emphases on reason, sensation, impressions,
and ideas to the same emerging intellectual
Hegemony of science. Indeed, Kant’s idealism,
premised on his distinction between phenomena
(things as conditioned by human sensibility and
understanding) and noumena (things as they
might be if presented purely to thought, apart
from sensibility) was informed by a historically
unavoidable respect for science. In Kant’s phenomenal world, causality is as universally operative
as in the world of the materialists.
Ironically, materialism found sophisticated
treatment in Hegel, the father of modern
absolute idealism, as well as in Marx and
Engels, whose title to materialism is fraught with
qualification. Hegel did not reject materialism
outright; he saw it, rather, as one-sided, merely
a stage in the dialectical apprehension of reality.
Like Empiricism, of which it is the systematic
expression, it divides the world by analysis into
discrete material entities but fails to see the unity
underlying these, a unity not inhering in the
entities themselves. This philosophical attitude, says
Hegel in his Logic, remains in bondage to the world
as immediately given, whereas reality is not a

random collection of entities but a rational, historically interrelated system. Moreover, “matter”
is an abstraction, which is never itself perceived
or given. What are perceived are its particular
manifestations (Hegel, 1873, pp. 62–4). Hegel
also historically situates materialism, along with
empiricism, rationalism, and utilitarianism, as
one of the forms of bourgeois thought.
These insights crucially molded the materialism of both Marx and Engels. It was Engels who
coined the phrase “historical materialism” and
the Russian Marxist Plekhanov who termed the
Marxist philosophy “dialectical materialism.”
Both terms cover the same materialist disposition
peculiar to Marxism, the former stressing materialism as the basis of historical development,
while the latter indicates a methodological
emphasis in the apprehension of reality. The
dialectical method views reality not as a conglomerate of fixed entities but as a changing totality
of related parts at whose core is a dynamic interaction between human labor and the natural
world. Marx’s own reflections on materialism, both
traditional and dialectical, are focused primarily
in his writings of 1844–6 (see also Marx). In
the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of
1844 (1959), Marx views Feuerbach as the “true
conqueror” of the Hegelian idealist philosophy
and praises his achievement in establishing “true
materialism” and “real science” by making the
social relation of “man to man” the principle of
his theory. Marx stresses that his own analysis of
political economy is “wholly empirical.” Viewing
the entire discipline of “pure” philosophy as the
latest expression of an alienated religious consciousness which ultimately justifies social injustice, Marx correlates atheism (the abolition of
religion) as the advent of theoretical Humanism
with communism (abolition of private property),
which signals the advent of practical humanism.
Marx suggests that his own doctrine of naturalism or humanism, which combines theory and
practice, is the “unifying truth” of both idealism
and materialism (Marx, 1959, pp. 14, 127–136,
142). What is encapsulated in these statements is
Marx’s two-sided polemic against both idealism
and previous forms of materialism, a polemic
which works toward the dialectical harmony of
their one-sided truths.
This procedure receives further clarification in
The Holy Family (first published in 1844), where

447
interaction between a collective historical human
subjectivity and the material world it generates
through its material activity or labor. Truth is
hence not a theoretical but a practical question
and human nature is never fixed but is “the
ensemble of social relations.” Finally, historical
materialism represents the point at which philosophy reestablishes its connections with practice:
“The philosophers have only interpreted the world,
in various ways; the point, however, is to change
it” (Marx and Engels, 1973, pp. 92–5).
Engels perpetuated Marx’s insistence that
materialism must be dialectical, particularly in
his Anti-Dühring of 1878, where he defended the
Hegelian aspects of Marxism against attacks from
Eugen Dühring. Drawing upon Hegel’s Philosophy of Nature, he formulated certain dialectical
laws of nature: the law that quantitative changes
abruptly become qualitative (which Engels also saw
happening in terms of economic and political
history); the law of interpenetration of opposites,
whose tension generates change; and the law of
the negation of the negation, which Engels held
to apply not only through nature but also in history and philosophy. Marx had already viewed
socialism as the negation of capitalist society,
which itself had negated feudalism. But, even
more than Marx himself, Engels stressed the importance of an organic connection between the
natural sciences and philosophy. Hence, in his
manuscripts posthumously published as Dialectics
of Nature in 1925, he saw Hegel as anticipating
the development of the nineteenth-century sciences
which viewed things as part of a larger process
of change and evolution rather than as static and
isolated atoms (Engels, 1940b).
In “Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy” (first published in
1886), Engels criticized the vulgar, “metaphysical,”
and ahistorical materialism of Buchner, Vogt,
and Moleschott, who based their thought upon
eighteenth-century mechanistic models of natural science which investigated both dead and
living things as finished objects. Engels saw the
nineteenth-century development of the natural
sciences as increasingly confirming the dialectical
method and the dialectical operation of nature.
He drew particular attention to “three great discoveries”: the cell as the basic unit of development;
the transformation of energy which showed that
forces in nature were mutually transforming

materialism

Marx sees eighteenth-century French materialism
as engaged in a two-pronged onslaught: against
contemporary religion and theology and against
the seventeenth-century metaphysics of Descartes,
Malebranche, Spinoza, and Leibniz. Marx thus
identifies two broad strands of French materialism. The latter is what interests Marx more since
it leads to socialism and communism: with its
roots ultimately in Democritus and Epicurus, its
modern development is heralded by Gassendi
and Bayle and runs through Bacon, Hobbes,
Locke, Condillac, and Helvetius, Bentham and the
socialists Robert Owen, Dezamy, and Gay. What
links this second line of materialism with Marx’s
own thought is the recognition that, if knowledge
is indeed derived from sensation and experience,
the empirical world must be rearranged so that
man experiences what is truly human in it.
Moreover, as stressed by some of these thinkers,
man’s nature is not to be found in individuals but
in their social relations (Marx and Engels, 1956,
pp. 154–66).
In The German Ideology (first published in
1845), Marx expresses his materialistic conception
of history, the premise of which is the empirically
verifiable set of conditions determining man’s
production of his material life. It is this material
economic activity, as embodied in productive
forces and social relations, which determines
the nature of individuals, society, and historical
development. Hence consciousness, ideas, morality, and religion have no independent existence
or history, but are dialectically (as opposed to
one-sidedly) dependent upon the economic substructure. This means that consciousness itself
is a social product and that the “individual” of
bourgeois society is a result, not the starting point,
of history. Hence Marx decries (i) the materialism of Feuerbach, who fails to see the sensuous
world as a historical product; (ii) traditional
empiricism which views history as a collection of
dead facts; and (iii) idealism which reduces history to an “imagined activity” (Marx and Engels,
1970, pp. 25, 42–7, 58–61).
Marx’s “Theses on Feuerbach” of 1845 offer a
more focused expression of his materialism: the
highest point reached by previous materialism, says
Marx, is “the contemplation of single individuals in ‘civil society.’ ” For Marx, however, reality
is not an inert collection of material entities to
be grasped by detached contemplation, but an

materialism

448
manifestations of universal motion; and the
Darwinian view of man as the result of a long
process of evolution. All of these pointed to
the dialectical character of the interconnections
of nature, which was also true, on a conscious
level, of the history of human society (Marx and
Engels, 1968, pp. 597–9, 610–12). While Engels
accepted that mind’s ultimate origin was matter,
he was far from holding that it was reducible to
matter. And while he stated that the influences of
the external world are reflected in the human brain
as feelings, thoughts and volitions, he refers to these
as “ideal tendencies” (p. 600), and his writings
generally suggest a mutual interaction between the
mind and the world.
Engels’s ambivalent treatment of Hegel’s dialectic is of the utmost importance here: he views
Hegel’s system as “a materialism idealistically
turned upside down,” one which regards nature as
expressing merely the Alienation of the absolute
idea, which advances beyond crude materialism
in seeking causes wider than individual motives
as the driving forces of history but seeking these
causes in philosophy rather than in history itself
(pp. 596, 613). Historical materialism identifies
the actual motives of entire peoples and classes.
However, Engels vehemently denies that Hegel
can be discarded; rather, his dialectic must be
transformed into a materially based science of “the
general laws of motion,” of both the external
world and human thought (pp. 593, 609). Engels
does indeed view the materialistic conception
of history as scientific; nevertheless, it should
be recalled that he is implying a conception of
science itself as flexible and dialectical.
In the twentieth century Lenin further developed dialectical materialism to include the notion
of partinost or partisanship. Developing Marx’s
and Engels’s view that “detached” philosophical
speculation was an illusion, Lenin affirmed that
socialist commitment was part of the definition
of genuine materialism, which was essentially a
philosophy of action. In Materialism and EmpirioCriticism (1909), designed to counter the spread
of “dangerous” idealistic views, Lenin adopted
Engels’s “theory” of reflection and attacked phenomenalism, which reduced physical entities to
complexes of sensation, insisting that science
revealed matter as ontologically prior to mind.
However, Lenin drew a distinction between

his own “philosophical” materialism, which held
matter to be independent, and “scientific materialism,” whose definition varied according to
scientific development. Despite his earlier
onslaught against idealism, Lenin’s revaluations
of Hegel in his Philosophical Notebooks (1933)
perhaps come nearer to the heart of the German
thinker than the analyses of Marx and Engels
themselves. Lenin saw, for example, that idealism
itself was a reductive category as applied to Hegel.
Marxist thinkers have continued to expound and
extend Marx’s materialism, some in the tradition
of Lukács, emphasizing its dialectical nature,
while others such as Althusser have stressed its
scientific claims.
The continued success and prestige of the
natural sciences in the twentieth century have led
to a proliferation of non-Marxist forms of materialism. The attack on theology and metaphysics
was continued by logical Positivism, initially
centered on the “Vienna Circle” including Moritz
Schlick, Otto Neurath, and Rudolf Carnap. Also
numbered among its adherents are the early
Russell and early Wittgenstein. Working in
the tradition of Hume and Comte, these new
positivists sought to reshape empiricism in the light
of modern logic and mathematics, adopting a
criterion of empirical verifiability and thereby
dismissing “metaphysical” claims as meaningless.
The philosopher’s prime concern, so they claimed,
was to clarify the meanings of statements.
This concern for linguistic clarity centrally
motivated Wittgenstein’s friend Gilbert Ryle,
who explored analytical behaviorism which was
materialistic inasmuch as it displaced analysis
from psychology itself to the behavior expressing
it. Some commentators have viewed Wittgenstein
also as a behaviorist. But perhaps what lies at the
core of his “materialism,” if indeed the term is
applicable, is the idea that language itself is social
and material, and while its relation with the
world is determined by convention rather than any
absolute correspondence, skepticism toward the
reality of the external world is preempted by
the unavoidably social character of the language
which must articulate it.
Even Freud’s work might be placed in a
materialist tradition in so far as it excludes
metaphysical explanations of the mind and world,
seeking instead to account for psychological traits

`Mauss, Marcel (1872–1950) 
French sociologist and anthropologist. He was the nephew and
close supporter of the great sociologist Emile
Durkheim, and, like him, born into a rabbinic
family. Nevertheless, he was not religious. He

studied under his uncle at the University of
Bordeaux and did brilliantly. Subsequently
he went to Paris to study ancient languages and
anthropology. In 1901 he was Director of
Studies at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes
in the history of religion of indigenous people,
and in 1925 he helped to found and became
joint director of the Institut d’Ethnologie at
the University of Paris. He was professor at the
Collège de France from 1931 to 1939 and retired
in 1940.
Durkheim was the leader of a gifted group of
scholars that included Mauss. The primary organ
for their writing was the Année Sociologique, a
journal begun by Durkheim in 1898. The group
was decimated by the 1914–18 war and Durkheim
died in 1917. Mauss was his literary executor
and the leadership of the school also fell to him.
He twice tried to revive the Année Sociologique in
the 1920s and again in the 1930s, without any great
success. He suffered during the Nazi occupation
of Paris and survived, but the experience left him
unable to work.
Mauss influenced not only ethnographers but
also linguists, psychologists, historians of religion,
and others in the social and human sciences.
His writings are fragmented and scattered; none
appeared as a book until the publication of a
collection of essays and lectures in 1950. His
early works were mostly done in collaboration with
Durkheim or others. His influence came less from
his published works than from the mediation of
colleagues and followers. His research brought
together ethnology and psychology, holding
that the latter was dependent on and limited by
cultural factors. He pioneered some of the concerns of American anthropologists such as Ruth
Benedict and Margaret Mead on the effects of
cultural differences in child rearing, and opened
up the new field of the cross-cultural study of
body techniques to show that behavior is hardly
ever innate but learned and determined by social
norms.
Mauss based his theories on detailed comparative analysis of existing anthropological data,
since he never did fieldwork. His most famous and
influential publication, The Gift, is generally held
to be the founding work of economic anthropology, profoundly influencing not only economic
anthropologists but also Lévi-Strauss and the

The materialism of much modern literary and
Cultural theory has in fact been initiated
from Freudian and Marxist insights: a unifying
characteristic of the varieties of Feminist criticism is their insistence on the material conditions
of Gender relations, including the treatment of
the female body itself, as explanatory vehicles.
Jacques Derrida, the initiator of Deconstruction, has centralized the Hegelian notion of difference in his critique of Western metaphysics:
to the extent that he attempts to expose the
reduction of “difference” by various forms of
transcendentalism, Derrida might be viewed as
a materialist. The so-called New historicism,
stemming partly from Foucault, also attempts
to view given texts as participants of a broader
cultural history. The long history of materialism
suggests the breadth of its application. In general
it might be viewed as a series of attempts to harmonize with the findings of contemporary science,
to reject transcendent explanations of the world,
to view language as a social practice, and to
paint a moral, political, and cosmological picture
which contains humanity’s observable practice
and the world’s observable features at its center.

structuralist school. It introduced the notion of
the total social fact rather than the institution as
the subject for investigation in sociology. Mauss
saw the gift as a total social phenomenon with
legal, economic, political, religious, and other
dimensions. He strove to dispel the idea current
in his time that small-scale economies produced
only for subsistence rather than for exchange,
showing that surplus is everywhere produced,
though the motives for exchange may be different
from those in our own society. He showed that in
what he termed “gift economies” exchange was
motivated by the obligation to give, to accept gifts,
and to return them.

North American society.
A founder of culture and personality studies,
Mead argued that cultural traditions and customs,
especially in socialization, are a central force in
shaping both individual and group personality
and behavior, and that human improvement
means understanding and changing the cultural
context in which people live. Perhaps more than
any other intellectual in the twentieth century,
she influenced the popular understanding of the
importance of the cultural context in issues such
as Race, sexuality/gender, and aggression.

object can be used in different ways), and cultural
objects whose meaning is variable and goes
beyond use-relations. In addition, he treats language itself as a Gestalt which interacts with our
other bodily fields or horizons in constituting a
coherent experience of the world.
The phenomenological orientation of MerleauPonty’s transformation of Gestalt theory is
evident in his rejection of the objective characterization of space in rationalism (for example,
Descartes’s res extensa) and his insistence that
we must conceive of space as “lived,” that is, that
theorizing about space (and mutatis mutandis,
for phenomena like time) must be guided by
the concrete phenomena of actual spatial comportment. Merleau-Ponty’s critique of the phenomenological tradition is most evident in his
critique of Husserl’s commitment to the primacy
of the individual knower (or transcendental ego)
and the primacy of intentionality as the basic
form of this ego’s experience; it is also evident in
his rethinking of Heideggerian Dasein in terms
of the lived body.
In rejecting traditional accounts of experience
in favor of a Gestalt-based approach, MerleauPonty seeks to reassess the fundamental interrelationship between self and world. Where the
tradition seeks to analyze the self as a being which
is independent of the world and whose most
fundamental mode of relating to the world is
detached cognition, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological orientation leads him to take lived experience as the starting point in characterizing self
and world. Whereas in the traditional Cartesian
view the body is considered to be a subordinate
and inessential dimension of human existence, for
Merleau-Ponty the body is neither inessential nor
a mere object; for him the body is an irreducible
lived perceptual horizon which is absolutely

Paris, and subsequently taught at various lycées,
the Ecole Normale, the Sorbonne, and the
Collège de France. Following the 1939–45 war
he served as an editor, together with Jean-Paul
Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, of Les Temps
Modernes.
Throughout his philosophical writings,
Merleau-Ponty worked to critique and provide
an alternative to the Cartesian presuppositions of
philosophical idealism. According to MerleauPonty, by treating the world as a complex object
of knowledge which is exhaustively reducible to
a set of correlates of acts of conceptualization,
critical idealism presents us with a model of reality which is logically systematic but which fails
to acknowledge the underlying discontinuities
between consciousness and the world. Against
Descartes, who had argued that the mind is
capable of establishing absolute certainty about its
own nature as well as about the essential nature
of the material world, Merleau-Ponty seeks to
underscore the fundamental ambiguities and
discontinuities of existence where the spirit of
Cartesianism had sought to transcend them.
Where Descartes and idealism argued for a theory
of consciousness in terms of a detached, disembodied, contemplative knower, Merleau-Ponty
argues for a notion of “flesh,” according to
which consciousness is inelectuably incarnate in
the midst of the world. For Merleau-Ponty the
Cartesian presupposition that the individual self
is independent and self-sufficient fundamentally
distorts the phenomena of relating oneself to
others and to the world. In this respect MerleauPonty’s thought owes a significant debt to the early
Heidegger’s view of human existence as always
already situated in the midst of a social world;
but Merleau-Ponty goes unmistakably beyond
Heidegger in insisting that consciousness must be
thought as embodied.
Fundamental to Merleau-Ponty’s rethinking
of human experience is his dual appropriation of
empirical psychology and Phenomenology. In
each case the appropriation entails a critique of
the tradition. In the case of empirical psychology,
Merleau-Ponty criticizes the stimulus–response
model of perception for assuming that things
and events in the world have an objective reality
in virtue of which they can affect us and in virtue
of which they can be recognized to be distinct
from us as well as from one another. Instead he

fundamental to our encounter with the world.
Much of Merleau-Ponty’s work is devoted to
a detailed characterization of this perceptual
encounter wih the world, which stands in stark
contrast to traditional attempts to proceed from
sense data or essences. Where for Cartesian
thinkers the problem of experience is one of
establishing a connection between an autonomous self and an objective world, for MerleauPonty the problem is one of analyzing the
primordial encounter between the two; for
Merleau-Ponty this primordial encounter is the
necessary foundation upon which traditional
conceptual abstractions like “self,” “world,”
“essence,” and “sense datum” can be made in the
first place.
This reversal of traditional dualistic accounts
of experience leads Merleau-Ponty to recognize
a fundamental relationship between the ways in
which the world is disclosed in perception and
in Art. In his writings on art, Merleau-Ponty
focuses primarily on painting and argues for
a reversal of the traditional concept of art as
mimesis. Where the tradition, following Plato,
seeks to characterize art as imitation of a precedent and independent natural world, MerleauPonty argues that self and world mutually
condition each other in such a way that nature can
be said to imitate art. In “Eye and mind” (1964a)
he approvingly cites the sculptor Giacometti’s
statement that authentic art works have the power
to influence fundamentally the ways in which
we see and experience the world: in this regard
Merleau-Ponty’s assessment of the place of art
in human experience shares basic affinities with
Heidegger’s position in “The origin of the work
of art.”
In his political writings Merleau-Ponty develops an ambivalent form of Marxism which
seeks to inscribe human subjectivity into history.
In Humanism and Terror (1947) he acknowledges
the power of concrete material relations to shape
and condition human consciousness, and he
criticizes Soviet Marxism for its tendencies toward
terror and deception, arguing for a distinction
between revolution and terror as acceptable
and unacceptable forms of violence respectively.
Later, in Adventures of the Dialectic (1955),
Merleau-Ponty continues to endorse a version of
Marxist historicism and dialectic; but he rejects
Marxism’s claim to exclusivity as the agent of

historically legitimate social change, and he
advances the idea of a “noncommunist left” as
the proper vehicle for revolution.

`metalanguage 
Language about language: a
technical term in linguistics for a “second order”
terminology which describes a “first order” language. Although the “first order” language being
discussed may use the same national language
as the “second order” metalanguage, the difference between the two is defined by the way in
which the metalanguage uses specific concepts.
Accordingly, a metalanguage will include certain terms. An example would be the way in
which structural linguistics uses expressions
such as “structure,” “oppositions,” and so on. In
structuralist theories, especially that of Roman
Jakobson, metalanguage is a critical language
which constitutes a scientifically objective analytical
method. In addition, he sees it as a fundamental
part of the process of language acquisition. Thus,
when learning its first language, a child begins by
making noises which have no function other
than to suggest an intention to communicate: the
sounds carry no lexical items that are recognizably meaningful. As the child grows, the metalinguistic operation continues to be of utmost
importance, since it guides how the child thinks
about language. Jakobson defines aphasia as the loss
of this basic metalinguistic operation. Jakobson’s
theory therefore concentrates on the way in
which metalinguistic operations are carried out in
relation to the “first order” language. He extends
his analysis to the metalinguistics of paraphrase
and synonymy, and then to translations between

`metaphor and metonymy 
Metaphor substitutes one term for another: metonymy substitutes an element of a term for the term itself.
Following the work of Ferdinand de Saussure,
Roman Jakobson theorized that a relation of
Binary opposition between the two underpins
the production of literary language. Beginning with

an essay on aphasia, he concluded that metaphor
was based upon similarity, metonymy upon
contiguity. He went on to state that metaphor is
the fundamental figure used in Poetry, while
metonymy is crucial to the operations of prose,
although the tension between the two does produce instances of the use of the opposing element.
He reached the position that they are in fact the
primary functions underlying the operation of
language.
Theories of the relation between metaphor and
metonymy have also been produced in Psychoanalysis and psychoanalytical criticism.
The crucial terms “condensation” and “displacement” as they are used in psychoanalytical theory
are the equivalent of Jakobson’s binary opposition.
The continual condensation and displacement
of images in dreams accord metaphor and
metonymy a similar importance. Jacques Lacan
picks up on this equivalence, theorizing that since
the Unconscious operates in accordance with the
relations between metaphor and metonymy, it is
in fact structured like a language.

`Mies van der Rohe, Ludwig (1886–1969)
German/American architect. Many of the factors
that contribute to the development of modern
architecture converge in the work of Mies –
including, for example, the prairie-style houses of
Frank Lloyd Wright, the “neoclassical” factories
of Peter Behrens, the naked brick buildings of
Hendrick Petrus Berlage, and the building techniques believed to be appropriate to and expressive of the new materials of reinforced concrete,
steel, and glass – and are distilled by the mind
and imagination of Mies into the most pure,
and most imitated, form of the International
style of modern architecture. Mies’s project for
an office building, Friedrichstrasse, Berlin, 1921,
which is the earliest proposed example of a
skyscraper enclosed entirely in glass, exhibits
the “skin-and-bones” construction and aspect
that is a fundamental aspect of Mies’s work. The

languages, and even the relations between different Sign systems.
However, Roland Barthes notes that it is
possible for a metalanguage to have a metalanguage of its own, in a potentially infinite series.
Thus a critic may use a metalanguage to write
about a literary Text, and another critic may
comment on the first critic, and so on. It is in this
sense, as in others, that Barthes can be seen to be
moving into Poststructuralism.
Metalanguage becomes a term used in
Semiotics in a shift similar to that employed by
Barthes. In semiotic theory, a metalanguage is itself
a sign system which refers to another sign system:
the technical term for this referential relationship is “denotation.” This is a development of
the structuralist use of metalanguage, with the
crucial distinction being that a metalanguage
itself constitutes a sign system. Thus critical
Discourse is metalinguistic in its relation to
literary texts, but the two constitute separate sign
systems. Moreover, it is the relation between the
two which produces the “meaning” of the text,
rather than some inherent qualities in the text
in and of itself. The use of a metalanguage by a
semiotician therefore opens a text up to elements
which structuralism would refuse to consider by
denoting them as being outside the text. The
implication of this theoretical position is that it
should be possible for critical metalanguage to
uncover the ways in which the text relates to other
sign systems. In this way semiotics attempts to deal
with topics such as context and the moments of
historical production and later reading, which
were very problematical for Structuralism.

Millett, Kate

Barcelona, Spain, 1929, reveals the simple elegance
(the “less is more”) of Mies’s architecture, which
is expressed also in Mies’s flawless “Barcelona”
chair that is integrated into the space of the
Pavilion like a fine piece of minimal sculpture.
In 1938, after realizing (perhaps belatedly)
that his apolitical attitude about architecture did
not fit into the politics of Nazi Germany, Mies
emigrated to the United States to become the
director, and architect of the new campus, of the
Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. In
the Farnsworth House, Plano, Illinois, 1946–50,
Mies made even more out of less, enriching and
condensing the enclosing space of this small
house into a refined rectangular temple reduced
to a pristine statement of floor plate, supporting
columns, roof plane, and glass curtain walls. Mies’s
Seagram building, New York, 1958, is the projected
Berlin glass skyscraper project of nearly three
decades earlier brought into existence, its crisp
and bold structure and surface now seeming
to symbolize corporate efficacy and authority.
Philip Johnson, who contributed to the design of
the Seagram building, is the most unabashed
admirer of Mies. Johnson’s own house, the
so-called Glass House, New Canaan, Connecticut,
1949, is a frank homage to the German Pavilion
and the Farnsworth House, and a glass display case
for enshrining Mies’s “Barcelona” furniture.
Johnson’s admiration for Mies’s work is offset
by Robert Venturi’s understanding of the Miesian
aesthetic – where Johnson sees the exquisite clarity of the architecture of Mies, Venturi finds
forced simplicity. For Venturi, the reductive and
exclusionary character of Mies’s work results in
an architecture which ignores the clutter that is
a necessary part of human experience. So while
the spaces made by Mies may be ideally proportioned, to Venturi they are unyielding and
unable to “survive the cigarette machine.” The
essence of Mies’s poetic vision of architecture is
expressed in his phrase “less is more”; Venturi’s
view of Mies, and his pragmatic approach to
architecture, is summarized in his comment that
“more is not less”; both are more or less correct.

`Millett, Kate (1934–) 
US feminist literary
critic. Kate Millett’s controversial study of literary misogyny, Sexual Politics (1970), earns her
a prominent place in the history of Feminist
criticism. Sexual Politics was the first major
American study of sexism in literature; it inaugurated that mode of inquiry that would later be
named “the feminist critique”: the identification
and analysis of derogatory and stereotyped representations of women in male-authored Texts,
and the scrutiny of those processes by which
sexist Hegemony is created in academia (notably,
the exclusion of female-authored texts from the
Canon of literary studies and the valorization of
sexist interpretative strategies). Although Toril
Moi has emphasized that Millett’s work is not
theoretically rigorous in any sense of the term
recognizable today, it does share several important assumptions with the new Cultural studies:
that a continuity exists between literary and
nonliterary texts (such as pornography and televised texts), and that literature is a crucial site
for the production of Ideology. Millett examined
the intimate relationships between “images of
women” in literature, ideologies of Gender, and
the real lives of women, particularly such phenomena as the daily rape, sexual harassment, and
abuse of women. Sexual Politics launched a
forceful denunciation of Freudian psychology as
it was then commonly applied to literature in the
United States. Although defenders of the status
quo used Millett’s bisexuality, bitter sarcasm,
and angry tone to discredit her, D.H. Lawrence,
Henry Miller, Norman Mailer, and Jean Genet will
never be read in quite the same way; indeed,
only Lawrence’s reputation as a “great” artist
has survived in the wake of Millett’s rereading.
Feminist critics can generally be faulted for
neglecting to preserve their own early history:
few appreciative recent critical studies of Sexual
Politics exist (notable exceptions are Humm and
Tong). A serious, collective reevaluation of the first
decade of feminist criticism, including Sexual
Politics, is long overdue.

`mirror-stage 
The theory of the mirror-stage was
the first major contribution to psychoanalytic
thought to be made by Jacques Lacan, and it
remains the cornerstone of his account of the construction of subjectivity, as well as his opposition
to ego psychology. The mirror-stage was originally described in a paper read to the Marienbad
Conference of the International Psychoanalytic
Association in 1936, but Lacan’s findings were not
published until after the 1939–45 war (Lacan, 1948
and 1949). Lacan’s description of the mirrorstage draws on two main sources: the psychological description of a child’s reactions when
faced with its reflection in a mirror, supplied
by Henri Wallon in his work on the origins of
character (see Wallon, 1984), and the contrasting
findings of primate ethology, which demonstrates
that young chimpanzees, unlike children, are
indifferent to the sight of their mirror-reflection.
This crucial stage in human development occurs
between the ages of 6 and 18 months. At this age,
the child is still virtually helpless and has yet to
coordinate its motor functions. Lacan attributes
this to the prematurity of birth in human beings.
The reflection seen in the mirror (or equivalent)
gives the child an image of the physical and motor
unity it will achieve, and is therefore greeted
with jubilation. The young child intellectually
anticipates and identifies with the image of what
it will become, and the basis is thus laid for
later identifications. Identification is to be understood in the psychoanalytic sense of the internal
transformation that occurs when the subject
assumes an image.
Although the mirror-stage is a crucial developmental stage, it also represents a profound
Alienation as the child identifies with something
that is, by definition, Imaginary and Other.
It thus implies a process of simultaneous recognition and misrecognition. From the outset, the
child identifies with an ideal image which provides
the matrix for the ego, viewed by Lacan as an
imaginary construct in which the Subject is
alienated. The ego is always an alter ego marked
by an aggressive relativity and therefore cannot
be equated with the subject. The mirror-stage is

responsible for the subsequent appearance of the
threatening and regressive fantasy of what Lacan
calls the “body-in-pieces,” in which anxiety about
fragmentation or disintegration comes to the fore.
The mirror-stage and its dialectic of recognition and misrecognition have specific effects at
the interpersonal level, which dominate the
child’s behavior in the presence of other children.
Lacan uses the term transitivism to describe the
characteristic combination of identification and
aggression. The child who strikes another claims
to have been struck; the child who sees another
fall bursts into tears. The foundations are thus
laid for the identification of slave with master, of
seducer with seduced.

`misreading 
A term in literary theory, used
especially by Harold Bloom to refer to the
primary object of reading, which is not a Text
but the relationship between texts. Because “the
interpretation of a poem necessarily is always
interpretation of that poem’s interpretation of
other poems” (Bloom, 1975, p. 75), one of the first
tasks of reading is to determine how the poem
being read responds to its precursor(s). If the poem
is itself the product of a strong reading, the poet
will have succeeded in managing the Anxiety
of influence produced by reading other strong
poets. In order to open imaginative free space for
themselves in which to make new poems, poets
deal with their precursors by acts of interpretative reduction, willful misprision, or productive
misreading. In Kabbalah and Criticism Bloom
acknowledges the precursor of his theory of
misreading, which is Gershom Scholem’s work on
Kabbalah, a gnostic tradition of reading that is now
belatedly recoverable only by antithetical criticism.
Misreading is not simply misunderstanding a
poem. It is rather the consequence of responding
fully to its intimidating power.

relations between generality and particularity; not
describing what a woman is, but how she comes

which oppress women.

`modernity 
The quality, experience, or period
of the “modern.” The idea of modernity highlights
the novelty of the present as a break or rupture
with the past, opening out into a rapidly approaching and uncertain future. In its broadest
sense, it is associated with the ideas of innovation,
progress, and fashion, and counterposed to the ideas
of antiquity, the classical, and tradition. As a way
of differentiating the most “up-to-date” elements of the present from those which establish
a continuity with the past, modernity has been
attributed as many properties over the years as
there have been competing definitions of the
historical present. In its most general form, it is
best understood as a structure of historical time
consciousness.
The term “modernity” (modernité) can be
traced back to Baudelaire’s essay on the French

painter Constantin Guys, “The painter of modern life” (Baudelaire, 1845). It was introduced there
to refer to “whatever contemporary fashion may
contain of poetry within history,” and defined as
“the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent,” a
“distillation of the eternal from the transitory.”
This nicely captures the Janus face of modernity
as a particular experience of change, the intensity
of which pushes it to the point of reversal. In
Walter Benjamin’s terms (Benjamin, 1938/9),
once it is abstracted from any particular content, “the new” is “always-ever-the-same.” As such,
modernity may be said to repress duration (the
experience of temporal continuity) in favor of
a series of more or less instantaneous “shocks,”
fragmenting subjectivity and producing a crisis in
narrative forms of representation.
“Modernity” is at base a category of
Aesthetics, in the most general sense of denoting a particular experience of time. Yet its historical dimension – the fact that this way of
experiencing time emerges only at a particular
historical moment, within particular kinds of
society – ties it closely to the sociological study
of cultural forms.
As a sociological concept, modernity is primarily associated with industrialization, secularization,
bureaucracy, and the City. Different theorists
offer competing interpretations of which social
processes are most important to the experience
of “the modern,” but as a discipline, sociology
is unified by the restriction of its subject matter
to what it defines as “modern” societies. (“Premodern” societies fall under the aegis of either
anthropology or history.)
For Durkheim it is the move from “mechanical” to “organic” forms of solidarity, consequent
upon the increasing division of labor, which is the
sociological key to modern life. In Tonnies this
is conceived as a move from the interpersonal
ties of community (Gemeinschaft) to the anonymous individuality of “society” (Gesellschaft).
In Max Weber it appears as a generalized process
of rationalization and disenchantment, whereas
in Simmel it is the objectified form of modern
Culture, exemplified by money, which lies at the
heart of the alienated subjectivity of modern life.
For Marx on the other hand, modernity, with its
constant renewal of the impulse toward change,
is an effect of the dynamics of capital accumulation. Marx distinguishes himself from the

To begin with, the Latin term modernus
(derived from modo, meaning recently) was
used to replace the cyclical opposition of
“old and new” characteristic of pagan antiquity
with a sense of the present as an irreversible
break with the past. It was this sense of the
present as “new” which was the basis for
the conflicts between ancients and moderns
which punctuated the Middle Ages from
the second half of the twelfth century to the
beginnings of the Renaissance.
The first major semantic shift took place with
the development of the consciousness of a new
age in Europe in the course of the fifteenth
century. This was initially registered by the
emergence of the terms “Renaissance” and
“Reformation” denoting the threshold of a
new (unnamed) period; by the designation of
the preceding epoch, now taken to be definitively over, as the “Middle Ages”; and by the
fixing of the term Antiquity to denote the
pagan culture of ancient Greece and Rome.
In the process, a new relationship between the
ancient and the modern was established
at the expense of the Middle Ages, since the
Renaissance gave precedence to the ancient over
all other cultures. At this stage the modern
was opposed to the medieval, rather than to
the ancient, and it had a right to preference
only in so far as it imitated the ancient.
In a third stage, running through the sixteenth
to the end of the seventeenth century, the
terms Renaissance and Reformation became
descriptive of now completed historical
periods. This called for a term denoting the
new period as a whole which followed the
Middle Ages. It was at this point that the connotation of novelty in the term modernus,

4.

meaning “of today” as opposed to “of yesterday” – what is over, finished, or historically
surpassed – was revived. The Renaissance
had attempted to replace the authority
of the Church with the authority of the
ancients. It was the ancients themselves who
now came under attack from the standpoint
of the present in the famous Quarrel of the
Ancients and the Moderns, or the “Battle of
the Books” as it came to be known.
It was during a fourth phase, the Enlightenment and its aftermath, that this sense of a
qualitative newness about the times, of their
being completely other and better than what
had gone before, was consolidated. Two things
made this possible: a reorientation towards
the future consequent upon Christian eschatology’s shedding of its expectation of the
imminent arrival of doomsday, and the opening up of new horizons of expectation by
the advance of the sciences, and the growing
consciousness of the “New World” and its
peoples. The abstract temporality of “the
new” took on an epochal significance, since
it could now be extrapolated into an otherwise empty future, without end, and hence
without limit. The distinctive structure of
modernity as a form of historical time consciousness may thus be seen to derive from
a combination of the Christian conception
of time as irreversible with criticism of its
corresponding concept of eternity.
These developments culminated at the end
of the eighteenth century, in the context of the
acceleration of historical experience precipitated
by the Industrial and French Revolutions, in
the transformation of a series of historical
terms. “Revolution,” “progress,” “development,” “crisis,” Zeitgeist, “epoch,” and “history”
itself all acquired new temporal determinations
at this time. As Koselleck (1979) puts it:
“Time is no longer the medium in which all
histories take place; it gains an historical
quality . . . history no longer occurs in, but
through, time. Time becomes a dynamic and
historical force in its own right.” It is because
of the qualitative transformation in the temporal matrix of historical terms which occurs
at this time that “modernity” in the full historical sense of the term is generally taken to
begin here. The modern is no longer simply

modernity

mainstream of academic sociology by periodizing
history according to “modes of production,”
rather than in terms of a simple modern/
premodern binary.
The difficulty with the “modern” as a category
of historical periodization is that its meaning
changes relative to the time (and place) of the
classification. We may distinguish five main
stages in the development of the idea since its
emergence within Western culture at around the
time of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the
fifth century ad.

opposed to either the ancient or the medieval
periods, but more generally to “tradition.”
It is this full sense of modernity, opening
up a new period by virtue of the quality
of its temporality, which is registered in
the mid-nineteenth century in Baudelaire’s
definition, cited above. The logic of the new,
fashion, and aesthetic modernism may thus
be understood as the result of an aestheticization of “modernity” as a form of historical
consciousness and its transformation into a
general model of social experience.
Finally, to take us up to the present, we must
add a fifth stage in which the peculiar and
paradoxical abstractness of the temporality
of modernity is at once problematized and
affirmed. This is the stage after the 1939–45
war, during which, as Raymond Williams
(1989) has put it, “ ‘modern’ shifts its reference
from ‘now’ to ‘just now’ or even ‘then,’ and
for some time has been a designation always
going into the past with which ‘contemporary’ may be contrasted for its presentness.”
“Modernity,” fixed now as a discrete historical period within its own temporal scheme,
hardens into a name and is left stranded in
the past. The Quarrel of the Ancients and the
Moderns is replaced with a Quarrel of the
Moderns and the Contemporaries. The Contemporaries become Postmoderns.

To become postmodern, however, in this
sense at least, is simply to remain modern, to keep
in step with the times. “What, then, is the postmodern?” Lyotard (1982) asks. “Undoubtedly
part of the modern. A work can [now] only be
modern if it is first postmodern. Postmodernism
. . . is not modernism at its end but in the
nascent state, and this state is constant.”
“Modernity” thus plays a dual role as a category of historical periodization: it designates
the contemporaneity of an epoch to the time
of its classification, but it registers this contemporaneity in terms of a qualitatively new,
self-transcending temporality which has the
simultaneous effect of distancing the present
from even that most recent past with which it
is thus identified. It is this paradoxical doubling
or inherently dialectical quality which makes
“modernity” both so irresistible and so problematic a category. It is achieved by the abstraction

of the logical structure of the process of change
from its concrete historical determinants.
The temporal matrix thus produced has three
main characteristics:
(i)

exclusive valorization of the historical
present over the past as its negation and
transcendence, and the standpoint from
which to periodize and understand history
as a whole;
(ii) openness toward an indeterminate future
characterized only by its prospective transcendence of the historical present and its
relegation of this present to a future past;
(iii) a tendential elimination of the historical
present itself as the vanishing point of a
perpetual transition between a constantly
changing past and an as yet indeterminate
future.
“Modernity,” then, has no fixed, objective
referent: “It has only a subject, of which it is full”
(Meschonnic, 1992). It is the product, in the
instance of each utterance, of an act of historical
self-definition through identification and projection which transcends the order of chronology
in the construction of a meaningful present. It is
this sense of modernity as a ceaselessly renewed
act of historical self-definition and projection
which underlies Habermas’s reformulation of
the idea of modernity as an “incomplete project”
(Habermas, 1980). However, whereas the content
of such acts of self-definition is always relative to
the historical location and projects of the actors
concerned, both Habermas and his “postmodern”
opponents tend to fix the meaning of “modernity”
through its historical association with the Enlightenment. For them, “modernity” is equivalent to
the incomplete project of enlightenment.
This has the merit of focusing debate onto a
specific social project, but it obscures the structure of the concept of modernity, repressing its
fluidity, formality, and paradoxical dynamics.
In this respect, it reflects the wider historical
process of colonialism during which a specific
(European) present was imposed as the measure
of social progress on a global scale. It is within
the framework of this kind of definition of the
“modern” that the term “modernization” came
to be used in the United States after the 1939–45
war to refer to a form of social and economic

`moral criticism 
The term “moral criticism”
has sometimes been applied to a tendency in
modern anglophone Literary criticism since
Arnold, and particularly to the positions of
such critics as F.R. Leavis and Lionel Trilling.
Distinguishing these critical positions from various kinds of Formalism, it indicates the prominence of moral and ethical vocabularies in
their terms of judgment: maturity, sincerity,
honesty, sensitivity, or courage become important
criteria in the valuation of literary and other
works. From a strict formalist standpoint, such
terminology betrays habits of reading that are
imperfectly emancipated from the Intentional
fallacy in their apparent confounding of textual with authorial characteristics. And although
moral criticism is rarely as theoretically naive
as its opponents claim, it encounters genuine
problems of this kind in its attempts to read
through the Text to the originating “quality of
mind” that has produced it.
Moral criticism should by no means by confused with a merely censorious or moralistic
attitude to Culture. A secularized puritanism is
seldom absent from its Discourse (notably in the
critical writings of Leavis and D.H. Lawrence), but
an important gulf lies between its judgments and
those, for example, of Plato in his proscription
of poets from the ideal republic, or of Victorian
reviewers who would condemn a novel for its
failure to mete out appropriate punishment to
an adulterous character. In fact the tradition of
moral criticism arises from various defensive
strategies designed to deflect or repel just such
attempted suppressions of artistic liberty: the
tradition of the “defense of poetry” is, at least in
its Romantic phase, one in which the author
claims a higher moral vision and thus the prophetic license to ignore the petty legalistic prohibitions of a transient moral code. Such claims
are implicit in Wordsworth’s 1800 and 1802 Prefaces to Lyrical Ballads, and explicit in Shelley’s
posthumously published A Defence of Poetry
(1840), in which the essentially beneficial moral
effect of poetry is discovered in its power to
awaken the imaginative sympathies of its readers.
In the later nineteenth century, Shelleyan
principles provided foundations for two lines of
moral criticism. In the first, Matthew Arnold
placed an enormous responsibility on poetry as
the replacement for failing religious creeds, and

moral criticism

“development” in Third World countries, modeled
on a particular version of the history of capitalism in the West. Similarly restricted definitions
of “modernity” can be seen at work in economic
debates about the future of Eastern Europe after
the fall of Communism, and in cultural debates
about religious “fundamentalism.”
What these debates illustrate is, first, that the
concept of modernity remains the privileged site
for the articulation of competing views about the
relationship of past, present, and future; and
second, that it is bound up, inextricably, with the
contradictory cultural legacy of European colonialism. For if modernity is primarily a temporal
concept, it none the less became possible in its
fully developed form only on the basis of certain
spatial preconditions: namely the unification of
the globe through colonial navigation (allowing
for the thought of “history” as a whole) and the
hierarchical distinction of European from nonEuropean cultures (in which a historical differential could be introduced within the present).
As the cultural constitution of Western societies
is transformed (especially by immigration) and
their economic Hegemony is challenged –
throwing the very concept of “the West” into
crisis – the prospect is opened up of new and
more “hybrid” definitions of modernity within
the terms of its Paradigmatic temporal form:
“postcolonial contra-modernities” (Bhabha, 1991)
and “countercultures of modernity” (Gilroy,
1993), bearing the promise of a new historicity.

moral criticism

460
accordingly demanded from it the qualities of
nobility, serenity, and “high seriousness.” In the
second, Shelley’s argument about the extension of
moral sympathies became an important resource
in the defense of the realistic novel – the form by
now central to debates about literature’s moral
influence. For George Eliot, W.D. Howells, and
others, the novel’s ability to develop our sympathies with other kinds of people made it a great
force for moral understanding and against bigotry.
This general plea had to be upheld against a
more narrowly moralistic disapproval of French
fiction, with its major theme of seduction and
adultery: for the mainly Protestant cultures of
Britain and the United States, the French novel
was dangerously sex-obsessed. The anglophone
tradition of moral criticism defined itself largely
within the context of a century-long contest
between sexual censorship and the novel (from
the Madame Bovary scandal of 1857 to the Lady
Chatterley trial of 1960), generally upholding the
moral value of imaginative sympathy in the sensitive realistic treatment of adult relationships,
while often repudiating the “excesses” of French
sensationalism. Along the way it evolved the
modern conception of the novel as an art, distinct
from the seedier realms of pornography or
journalism.
The compromise thus effected in this emergent
moral criticism between the prophetic privilege
of the writer and the guardians of public decency
was endangered by the simultaneous emergence
of a forthright aestheticism which flatly denied the
relevance of moral discourse to art. Most boldly
– and to moral critics, most unhelpfully, in the
light of his subsequent disgrace – Oscar Wilde
declared in his Preface to The Picture of Dorian
Gray (1891) that “There is no such thing as a moral
or an immoral book. Books are well written, or
badly written. That is all.” Twentieth-century
moral criticism had thus to fend off not only philistine meddling but also this kind of aestheticist
defiance, which in detaching art completely
from moral questions thereby destroyed its chief
claim to beneficial social influence. A revised
formula emerged, which still insisted on the crucial moral value of the literary work, but which
removed it from the discussion of overt ethical
lessons, placing it instead at the level of the
writer’s basic apprehension of the world – or the
quality of the artist’s “sensibility.” In these terms

Henry James, in his 1908 Preface to The Portrait
of a Lady, wrote of “the perfect dependence of the
‘moral’ sense of a work of art on the amount of
felt life concerned in producing it” (James, 1987,
p. 484). This formula, along with similar declarations by D.H. Lawrence in his scattered essays on
the life-enhancing capacities of the novel, provided
the basis for much of the moral criticism of
F.R. Leavis, notably in its identification of moral
value in literature with realistic perception of
“life.” Realism was to become an important
component of Trilling’s moral criticism, too: for
him the great value of the novel as an agent of
moral education lay in its exploration of reality
as more complex than our received notions of
righteousness.
The fortunes of moral criticism in this tradition
reached their height in the 1950s, in the influence enjoyed by Trilling’s The Liberal Imagination
(1950) and by Leavis’s The Great Tradition (1948).
For both critics, judgments about literature were
emphatically judgments about life and its relative
values. In Leavis’s case especially, the relentless
insistence on moral seriousness and maturity,
however, and the vitalistic vagueness of the muchinvoked “life,” provoked numerous objections
to the restrictive tendencies of this form of criticism. The rise of high theory in the 1970s all
but removed problems of literature’s moral status from the critical agenda, and the discourses
of “Postmodernism” scarcely deign even to
recognize them; but in more political forms
they resurface in both Feminist criticism and
the British Marxist tradition of Williams and
Eagleton.

`Mukarovsky, Jan (1891–1975) 
Czech philologist, literary critic, and theoretician of literature. In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s,
Mukarovsky was the leading representative of
the Prague Linguistic Circle and one of the
pioneers of Structuralism.
Mukarovsky’s early work bears an unmistakable influence of Russian formalism and at the
same time introduces elements of structuralism
into the analysis of Czech poetry and prose, further developing theory and Tynyanov’s concept
of System of systems. In particular, Mukarovsky
proposed the analysis of artistic work as a
dialectical unity formed by the work’s dynamic
structure. As is evident from his book Aesthetic
Function, Norm, and Value, the concept of the aesthetic function lies at the core of Mukarovsky’s
poetics. On the basis of the theory of an Austrian
psychologist K. Büller, who singled out three
basic elements of verbal communication – the
author, the addressee, and the subject of communication – the Czech scholar distinguishes
three main functions of language: expressive,
appellative, and communicative, which he calls

practical functions. To these three functions,
which are directed toward nonverbal goals lying
beyond the borders of a verbal Sign, Mukarovsky
adds an aesthetic function, which makes the
structure of the verbal sign the center of critical
investigation. In his essay “Two studies of poetic
designation,” Mukarovsky maintains that the
“orientation of the aesthetic function toward the
sign itself is the direct result of the autonomy
peculiar to aesthetic phenomena.” The focus for
Mukarovsky is on transmitting information.
The signs are used only as a means that can be
dismissed once the content of the information is
communicated. Language, “the most highly developed and complete system of signs,” is always
communicative in a wider sense, including its use
of aesthetic function. In this particular function
the focus shifts toward the construction of the
“sign made out of signs.” Mukarovsky admits
that the boundary separating the aesthetic function from practical functions is not always distinct
and that practical functions cannot be “entirely
suppressed in a purely autonomous artistic
expression; consequently, every poetic work is . . .
simultaneously a presentation, an expression,
and an appeal.” However, the aesthetic function
is present in every practical activity and dominates
the communicative function. Owing to its domination over the communicative function, the
aesthetic function changes the very nature of the
communication. Therefore Mukarovsky can say
that the aesthetic function “dialectically negates”
the information-transmitting orientation of the
communicative function of the signs without
denying either their communicative character or
their ability to transmit verbal messages.
Mukarovsky, together with other members of
the Prague Linguistic Circle, rejects both the
early Russian formalists’ view of literature as an
autonomous reality and the sociological approach
to literature characteristic of the socialist realist
critics. As Mukarovsky states in his Studies in
Aesthetics:
Without a semiological direction the theorist
will always tend to consider the work of art as a
purely formal construction, or as a direct reflection of the psychological or even physiological
disposition of the author, either in the distinct
reality expressed by the work, or in the ideological, economic, social or cultural situations of a

Mukarovsky, Jan

`Mudimbe, V.Y. (1941–) 
V.Y. Mudimbe’s
contribution as an intellectual, writer, anthropologist, philosopher, critic, and theologian has
been considerable. As part of the postcolonial
intelligentsia writing in both French and English,
Mudimbe’s works have raised some of the most
fundamental and difficult questions about the
nature of knowledge, the conditions of knowing,
the deeper problems inherent within the critical
and methodological tools available, and the limits
within which contemporary theories and philosophy both produce what has come to be known
as Africa and are produced by it. Mudimbe poses
Africa as a series of philosophical inquiries in
which he explores Discourses about, by, and on
Africa.

given environment. This will lead the theorist
to treat the developmental process of art as a
sequence of formal transformations or to ignore
the developmental process (as do some schools
of psychological aesthetics), or to conceive it as
a passive reflection of a process external to art.

Instead, Mukarovsky points out that poetry and
literature in general develop through a series
of structures (political, economic, ideological,
literary), which change in time, not separately from
one another but by forming a structure of higher
order, a structure of structures with its own
hierarchy based on its dominant elements. This
structure of structures differs from Tynyanov’s system of systems in that, by means of the general
theory of signs, Mukarovsky supplies an explanation of the mechanism that makes the interaction among different cultural systems possible. As
Jurij Striedter writes in his Literary Structure,
Evolution, and Value, Mukarovsky
offers a vision of a literary work not as a series
of linguistic signs fixed for the purpose of artistic communication but as a fabric of meanings
concretized by the receiver on the basis of this
artifact and with the aid of conventionalized
codes. Only this fabric of meanings is capable of
becoming the actual object of aesthetic contemplation and valuation (in Czech structuralist
terminology, the “aesthetic object”). (Striedter,
1989, p. 93)

As if anticipating future semiotic theories,
Mukarovsky offers a mechanism for the investigation of literary work: “Only the semiological
point of view will allow theoreticians to recognize
the autonomous existence and the essential
dynamism of the structure of art and to understand its evolution as an immanent movement,
but in a relationship in constant dialectic with
the evolution of other fields of culture.” The key
element of this mechanism is the notion of the
dynamic dominant presented in Mukarovsky’s
“Standard language and poetic language” (1932):
The dominant gives a poetic work its unity.
However, this is a kind of unity which has
been characterized in aesthetic as “unity in
diversity,” a dynamic unity in which one can sense
at the same time both harmony and lack of harmony, rather like convergence and divergence.

Convergence is determined by striving towards
the dominant, divergence by a resistance to the
striving which can be seen in the static background
of non-actualized components.

The discovery of the dominant enables a literary
critic to determine the value of a literary work.
Mukarovsky, unlike Marxist critics for whom the
value of a literary work consists of the ideologically correct representation of a social environment, saw the value of a literary work in its
ability, based on its innovative deviation from
literary tradition and convention, to challenge
the total view of society.

`multiculturalism 
A term, says Henry Louis
Gates, Jr (1993), whose “boundaries are not
easy to establish,” though it has pointed generally since the 1960s to “the messy affairs of
cultural variegation.” In that regard it connotes
either some mode of transnational interrelationships between the Cultures of two or more
countries, or it suggests in a more circumscribed
manner the broader dimensions of multiple
cultural identities within the boundaries of a
single nation.
Although the world can be viewed as “fissured
by nationality, ethnicity, race and Gender,” it is
none the less inherently “multicultural already”
as indicated by its easily discernible “mixing and

463
This international and inclusive effort has not
been without its detractors, however, in reacting
to what has been characterized as the demise of
the “traditional Western Canon of knowledge”
and values and hence the demise of the very raison d’être for Western nations and culture. Allan
Bloom has argued this case vigorously in The
Closing of the American Mind (1987) by observing
what he calls “the decomposition of the university” (a symbol for culture) due to the general
lack of “solidarity in defence of the pursuit of
truth” either in the natural sciences, the social
sciences, or the humanities: “gone is the time when
there was the expectation of a universal theory of
man that would unite the university and contribute
to progress, harnessing Europe’s intellectual depth
and heritage with our vitality.” What remains for
the students in the society, according to Bloom,
is a belief that all truth is relative, buttressed by
a feeling of allegiance to some vacuous concept
of equality; therefore higher education both
fails democracy and impoverishes the souls of
its citizens. In a somewhat less dogmatic view
Dinesh D’Souza in Illiberal Education (1992) does
not oppose outright the inclusion of the cultural
works of non-Western nations, but cautions
against the imposition of ideological tenets as
factors in the selection and study of such works,
as well as in the uncritical distortions of nonWestern cultures in the guise of prejudiced prescriptions. To counter the implications of such
views as illustrated in the reputed dictum of Saul
Bellow: “I will read the Zulus when they have produced a Tolstoy,” perhaps what is needed is the
attitude espoused by David Aronson in Teaching
Tolerance (1994) as “the central and defining
value” for social and cultural relations; for
if tolerance requires at a minimum that we
respect each other’s freedom, it also suggests a
substantive vision of the good life. A life of personal growth, wealth of experience, dedication
to the struggles of others, spontaneity, joy, and
wholehearted opposition to ignorance and fearmongering; this is what we wish for children
and for ourselves. We are here only once, and
it would be narrow and incurious not to look
around.

However cogent the foregoing meaning of the
term “multicultural” may appear, that definition
has been rivaled if not overshadowed by a second

multiculturalism

hybridity” (Gates). Thus the word “multiculturalism” can be seen as having referentiality, however ambitious or ambiguous, to transnational
associations between the cultures of two or more
nations. The use of the term in this sense has
focused usually, but not entirely, on the evidence of literary culture. Books such as Stuart
Hirschberg’s One World, Many Cultures (1992)
and Barbara Salomon’s Other Voices Other Vistas:
Short Stories from Africa, China, India, Japan
and Latin America (1992) clearly embody this
concept.
Within the twentieth-century context of the
evolution of world history as evidenced by the intercontinental exploding populations and the general public recognition of the increasing number
of nation-states, the underlying assumption of the
intrinsic superiority of “Western tradition” has
been necessarily called into question and revaluated in order to acknowledge and incorporate
“the heritage of a variety of peoples and cultures”
(Dasenbrock, 1992). Thus the foci of this newer
interest have been global, international, and
inclusive, thereby compelling a reconsideration of
intellectual, political, economic, and social perspectives so as to be aware of and to respect both
perceived differences and commonalities among
peoples and cultures. The principal Symbol on
the world stage for the cognizance of this new
reality in the half-century since the 1939–45 war
(1945–95) is preeminently the organization of
the United Nations in its General Assembly and
Security Council, and in the several structures
by which that institution manifests its global
presence and operations: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO); World Health Organization (WHO);
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and
others. The charter for the United Nations bears
witness to this latter-day phenomenon of global
pluralism in the stating of its purposes as the
maintenance of international peace and security,
the development of friendly relations among the
states, and the achievement of cooperation in
solving international economic, social, cultural,
and humanitarian problems. Other factors also
contribute to the impact of global pluralism, for
example, the burgeoning trend toward a global
economy as a powerful catalyst generating the need
for enlargement of perspective about the paradox
of a shrinking world geopolitically.

multiculturalism

464
principal focus of concern in the emerging
widespread recent usage of this term. Indeed
the term has been prominently used in the
United States with what appears to be a more
circumscribed significance that has evoked
intense controversy. In fact “multiculturalism” has
become what Carlos Cortes calls “the omnipresent, often-celebrated, often-excoriated ‘M’ word”
(1994). E.D. Hirsch’s book Cultural Literacy:
What Every American Needs to Know (1987) contained only a passing allusion to “multicultural
education” and no definition. Six years later
the second edition of the Dictionary of Cultural
Literacy (1994) explicitly defined the term “multicultural” as “the view that the various cultures
in a society merit equal respect and scholarly
interest” and specified its locus as the United
States in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Hence
the term’s second usage has been basically an
outgrowth of certain segments of American
academic and educational interests in order to
provide a kind of umbrella credibility for the
study of ethnic diversity and pluralism by such
varied groups as Afro-Americans, Chicanos and
Chicanas, Asian-Americans, Hispanics, Native
Americans, and gays and lesbians, and for the
expression of concern about the representation to
the majority society of the cultural identities of
race, gender, Ethnicity, and sex, both currently
and historically.
Taken seriously, the pursuit of this broader
knowledge within an increasingly culturally
diverse society results inevitably in a profound
reconsideration of the notion of an indispensable dominant cultural tradition existing in the
society and the means whereby that assumed
validity of dominance has been perpetuated by
history, education, language, politics, Class, and
values. Within American society a continuing
tacit assumption (with obvious resultant practices)
up to the 1939–45 war and just after centered
upon the idea that, although American culture
had been geographically and historically viewed
in relation to regions, nevertheless the most
important values and influences inherent in that
culture were generated from New England and
the upper Eastern seaboard, or as expressed by
Simonson and Walker (1988): “a particular white,
male, academic, eastern U.S., Eurocentric bias” was
present in the “concept of American culture.”
Just as the defining image of “the melting pot”

had been applied to the manner in which diverse
groups of immigrants were supposed to be assimilated into a new nation and to develop a new
identity of commonality, so also in culture, especially literary, a counterpart description became
evident in the use of the word “mainstream” –
an image which “has long haunted the study of
American culture,” says Paul Lauter in referring to “The literatures of America” (1990). The
image immediately signals the marginalizing
of individuals, groups, and works as stated in
phrases such as “writers of color,” “most women
writers,” and “regional or ethnic writers.” Indeed,
in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s a popular textbook used in colleges and universities for the
study of literary culture was Major American
Writers; 40 male authors and 2 female authors
were included in the 2,000 pages because “they
constitute the core of the national letters” or the
“mainstream.” This contrasts with an increasingly popular textbook of the 1990s, The Heath
Anthology of American Literature. It consists of two
volumes totaling 6,000 pages containing selections
from several hundred authors representing “as
fully as possible the varied culture of the United
States” from the earliest era to the most recent,
including “a large number of lost, forgotten or
suppressed literary texts,” and “works of literary
accomplishment” based on the principle of “how
a text engages concerns central to the period in
which it was written as well as the overall development of American culture.” The book illustrates
more recent images than “mainstream” as seen
in the use of “mosaic” and “quilt,” implying
both the reality of the specific parts as well as the
whole portrayal they constitute.
The intensity of the controversy elicited by
this second usage of the word “multiculturalism” is clearly evident in the extent to which the
newer emphasis has been attacked intellectually
as a dilution of core knowledge and values,
for example, by Arthur Schelesinger in The
Disuniting of America (1991). That usage is also
manifested in the practical steps that have been
taken officially to forestall the implications of
the concept, for example, by the Lake County,
Florida, school board which adopted in 1994 a policy requiring its public school teachers to “instill
in our students an appreciation of our American
heritage and culture such as our republican
form of government, capitalism, a free enterprise

`musicology and culture 
Musicology is dated
by the Oxford English Dictionary as a term first
recognized in 1919. The OED offers an etymology
from the French musicologie, but the concept
certainly derives from the German Musikwissenschaft, most notably from a widely influential
German journal article published by Guido Adler
in 1885, entitled (in translation) “The scope,
method and aim of musicology” (Bujić, 1988).
Adler laid down a distinction between historical
and systematic musicology, the one concerning
what might be called, for convenience, “facts”
(Adler calls this “history”), the other concerning
structures of music itself, aesthetic approaches,
pedagogy, and ethnographics (Adler wrote of
the “dominating principles in the individual
branches of music”). In defining the term, the OED
opts for exclusion: musicology is the study of music
“other than technique of performance or composition.” Most of those who are not musicians
will assume that technique of performance or
composition is the vital area of the study of
music, and that musicology must therefore be
peripheral and perhaps self-gratifying. On the
contrary, from Psychoanalysis to Gender

studies it has been almost a weather gauge of critical thought. Not without reason did Umberto
Eco observe in A Theory of Semiotics (1979) that
Semiotics, and, it might be added, Structuralism in general, pick up on ways of thinking and
theorizing that have been familiar in musicology
for centuries.
Obviously the twentieth century was a time of
acute personal introspection among intellectuals
in response to the fragmentation of Culture
against the persistent backdrop of our cultural
heritage. In musical styles these overlaps have
happened before. In the early seventeenth century there was bitter dispute between entrenched
traditionalism in musical composition and a
visionary modernism that failed to lay down the
sorts of precedent it foresaw. In the late eighteenth
century “enlightened” modernists (nowadays we
remember Haydn and Mozart above all others)
simply wrote Baroque practice, including Bach and
Handel, out of the script in the cultured public
mind, as the musicology of the time reflects.
By and large people lost interest in old music,
and the thirst for the new was at its height. The
twentieth century was different again. We have to
take stock of the fact that there were two cultures
in play for an astonishingly long time – those who
listened to Schoenberg, and those who listened to
Rachmaninov, to put it in an emblematic way,
almost as one might place abstract and representational visual art side by side. Yet that is to look
only at the musical “high art” of the century,
and only at the product. What we also have to
take stock of is the impact of technology, which
brings in the question of who “uses” the music
of which musicology is the study, and how it is
produced (by composers and performers) and
managed, which is surely also a part of modern
musicology, the OED notwithstanding.
Fools rush in to easy analogies between the
arts, but there is no harm in logging how closely
the trends of twentieth-century culture in general were reflected in and, it could be claimed,
sometimes driven by, the music of the age:
expressionism, futurism, dada, minimalism – these
and the similar great themes of early modern,
modern, and post-modern artistic expression
are concepts as familiar in musicology as in any
other field of cultural history. Indeed, one of the
fascinating aspects of the age of fragmentation,
founded on what Christopher Butler (1994) calls

musicology and culture

system, patriotism, strong family values, freedom of religion and other basic values that are
superior to other foreign or historic cultures”
(Jacobs, 1994). It is not surprising, then, as Gates
pointed out, that “multiculturalism” becomes
“a sweet or bitter mouthful, depending on your
sympathies.”

a “withdrawal from consensual languages,” is
how each new creative wave has swept as a unifying force through the different arts. Of course
some well-known, towering alliances of actual
people (Schoenberg/Kandinsky) or of influence
and adaptation (Joyce/Berio) are one clear sign
of this. To those interested in Cultural theory,
however, what is even more striking is the consensus of critical terminology and conceptual
aspirations. The modern musicologist can read the
history and theory of, say, postmodern architecture and have no difficulty in understanding the
general points at issue, the attitudes struck, the
underlying aspirations.
Before comment on the general trends of
musicology, three important subsidiary matters
need to be aired. First, musicology in the sense
of “pure” music history will figure here in contention rather than as a central consideration.
Musicology in this sense emerged from a fairly
amateurish obscurity in the English language into
a surge of music-historical inquiry, principally in
America, in the 1930s and 1940s, establishing a
tradition that continues to this day. Lang’s Music
in Western Civilization (1941), for example, was
a momentous step, and part of a community of
interest among such as Austin, Bukofzer, Grout,
Reese, Sachs, and Strunk. What these and other
scholars, including many of European extraction, took pride in was a scientific approach to
music-history writing, addressing basic topics –
origins, analogy, periodization, continuities, the
“great-man” theory (a gendered theory if ever
there was one), theories of progress, growth,
development, revolution, evolution (Allen, 1962).
The accumulation of what has become classic
historical musicology is immense. Witness the
progression from a small-format fifth edition of
Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians in
1954 to 1980 and the 20-volume, large-format
New Grove. Not only in music-history writing,
but also in the editing and publication of old
music from the medieval period onwards, has the
information explosion broken musicological
ground. This fine, progressive movement, the
modern musical mind rediscovering what have
become libraries full of compositions from earlier
ages, was taken for granted, by and large, until
voices of protest began to appear in the 1970s
and 1980s (Kerman, 1985). What is the point, it
was asked, of producing reams of printed music,

yielded by thousands of postgraduate and professional careers, that hardly anyone is likely
ever to sing, play, or hear? Music theorists, given
the premium they place upon the close (timeconsuming, and musically and intellectually
challenging) study of musical structure and effect,
and their natural tendency to be interested
mainly in recent and contemporary music, in
“living” art, naturally joined in the questioning
chorus. During this recent period “historical
musicologist” and “theorist” have become in some
quarters terms of mutual abuse, though nowadays,
as is observed below, new antinomies are emerging. It is fair to say that at least some of the
work of what may be called “pure” musicology
can be carried out by those who possess little
or no skill in actually composing, performing,
or contributing to the critical understanding of
music itself. Thus it is not a petty debate but an
artistic one, and it is not surprising that historical musicology in these aspects has been put on
the defensive.
Second, if introversively one may rehearse the
Schoenberg/Rachmaninov divide, extroversively
the real divide appeared in the 1960s (with its roots
after the 1914–18 war in the development of
musical recording and broadcasting) when popular music became a mass product and, as with
Film studies (see Kristeva), began to develop
its own canon of scholarship and critical thought.
From the Beatles to Madonna a new phenomenon swept the world, vastly exceeding the
impact of jazz, swing bands, crooners, Hollywood film music, and the other foretastes of a
music that is truly of the people. There were two
Western musics in the twentieth century, and
the terms popular and classical come so easily to
us that the revolution they represent is easily
missed; a few centuries ago, the (vague) equivalent would have been “secular” and “liturgical,”
terms for which a modern dictionary would
find essentially no current use. What the great
majority of people around the world think of as
“their” music is something for which musicology
finds little place, even if for the specialist there are
many fascinating crossovers.
Third, and following on from what I have
called the “real divide” within Western music, it
was in the late twentieth century that musicology
spread its net throughout non-Western cultures.
One has the impression from many sources that

467
of music and language – could be taken for distant relatives is no accident (see Jakobson).
On the other hand, new music in the twentieth
century created new challenges, which were met
conspicuously by Allen Forte, whose textbook
on pitch structure dominated the field from
1973 onwards. Forte developed procedures
called “pitch-class analysis” by adapting aspects
of set-theory mathematics to the problems
of understanding harmonic structure in early
twentieth-century “atonal” composition, and
indeed other repertories. Within musicology,
there is no denying the mighty conceptual gulf
between projects such as The New Grove and
Forte’s Yale project of the 1970s and 1980s in
building up a substantial body of research based
on set theory. They have one obvious feature in
common, however: without computers, neither
could have happened as they did.
These trends have engendered new movements, which present themselves as reactions,
indeed complaints, but which may turn out
to be developments, however subversively. First,
musicology remained until rather late in the day
what used to be thought of as a gender-free
zone, that is, male-dominated. Starting with the
impatience one expects from a theorist rather
than a historical musicologist, Susan McClary set
the whole issue ablaze:
Musicology fastidiously declares issues of
musical signification to be off-limits to those
engaged in legitimate scholarship. It has seized
disciplinary control over the study of music
and has prohibited the asking of even the most
fundamental questions concerning meaning . . .
It is finally feminism that has allowed me to
understand both why the discipline wishes these
to be nonissues, and also why they need to be
moved to the very center of inquiries about
music. (McClary, 1991)

This is noted not as a record of the ephemeral:
cultural historians of the future will surely know
about Feminine Endings as they wade through the
masses of citations, articles, and already books
devoted to McClary’s ideas, or arguments from the
same climate (Citron, 1993). Like most writers of
her generation and on her subject McClary is
overtly indebted to well-established, even oldfashioned feminist literary studies, rather than
to musicology (see Feminist criticism). This

musicology and culture

Ethnomusicology, part of “systematic musicology,” was virtually invented and remains
indebted to one man (Pete Seeger); yet in an era
of mass democratization, communication, travel,
and migration it was inevitable that anthropology would burgeon in the groves of academe, and
within anthropology, ethnomusicology. Here
too the predictable antinomy, rather like that
between historical musicology and theory, arose
between a contextual camp, more sociologically and methodologically orientated, and the
structurally orientated research of the music of
“other” cultures. The debate continues; and a
constant factor is intrusion. It is one thing to study
the influence of Balinese music on Debussy. It is
quite another (see Canon) to study, say, the
largely uncharted world of mid-century black
American revivalist musical preaching in the
1930s, where the white researcher, depending to
an exceptional extent on “oral history,” will find
most doors firmly closed.
Within musicology, it is particularly in music
theory that interdisciplinary impact has been
tested. Behaviorism brought, in 1956, its standard
textbook of the musicological appropriation of
information science (Meyer, 1956). Mentalism
(see Chomsky) inspired a new popularization of
the idea of music as a hierarchical “language”
(Bernstein, 1976); and the semiology of music (see
Semiotics) was developed throughout the 1970s
and 1980s into a global musicological theory,
based on Molino’s tripartitional sociological
model of a “poietic” pole (all facets of production),
an “esthesic” pole (all facets of reception), and
a “neutral” pole which provisionally inscribes
immanent structures (Nattiez, 1990). Without
doubt, however, the two dominating musicanalytical theories of recent times have been
manifestations of structuralism (Dunsby and
Whittall, 1988). On the one hand there is musicostructural analysis based on the theories and
techniques of Heinrich Schenker, whose ideas
were forged in the “Durkheim–Freud–
Saussure” ethos of the early twentieth century,
although it was to Goethe and post-Kantian
idealist philosophy that Schenker pointed for
authority. Schenkerian notation has become a
lingua franca of music-critical research. Looked
at through the wrong end of a telescope, it is
roughly analagous to a Chomskian tree structure,
and that the two – grammatico-semantic analogues

musicology and culture

468
musicological issue is not or is not only an issue
of exclusion, that women’s music has not been
played or studied, and that women scholars have
been inconspicuous (in the large publication
Companion to Contemporary Musical Thought
57 experts contributed learned articles, and it
appears that only four female experts were to be
found, or found suitable – see Paynter et al.,
1992). The nub of the argument, it seems, is that
were these imbalances rectified, and whatever
the means of rectification, the whole Paradigm
of musicology would alter, not necessarily for the
better, but for a different paradigm that would
represent justice and cultural richness. The New
Grove Dictionary of Women Composers is of
course a record of cultural failure that is not its
protagonists’ fault, which seems quite a pointless
enterprise; it is perhaps typical of modern
musicology of this kind, fortunately a minority
activity despite establishment hype, to have
serenely ignored the lessons of critical theory
that it appears never to have studied.
Second, as to new movements, this sociological debate is being conducted in a shifting
musicological environment that has led to the
appearance in recent literature of the term New
Musicology. The theory boom that began to
elbow the historical musicology establishment
into retreat between roughly 1960 and 1985,
and which, as has been indicated, was at root a
structuralist enterprise, was always a potential
victim of anti-formalism (see Formalism). Our
musical legacy, it would be claimed, needed to be
interpreted in context, not through the grid of
some cold, contemporaneous critical methodology, but as part of the cultural world in which it
arose (for example, Kramer, 1990). This ingredient, a call for “humanistic criticism” that one can
now see was a sustained and growing campaign

in the 1980s, mainly in America, has of course a
distinguished pedigree in cultural theory. Another
ingredient, the increasing interest in musical
“narrative,” may seem to be more in line with the
study of structure (see Narratology), but its
main manifestations so far, notably in the work
of Carolyn Abbate (1991), seem to authorize a
loose, impressionistic approach to criticism that
has been called “intoxicating” and “dazzling”
but lacking “rigor.” These ingredients may well
amount to a recipe for the renewal of modern
musicology, perhaps in the sense of a new “structuration” (see Giddens, 1973). In other words, the
Paradigm shift called for by McClary and Citron
is imbricated with one, more fundamental, that
has already been diagnosed (see Adorno) and is
being monitored, in which tradition figures large.

`name of the father 
In Lacanian psychoanalysis, the paternal metaphor which founds
the Symbolic, and the agency of the symbolic law.
The symbolic law is negative and privative, and
it is the invocation of the name of the father that
maintains the incest taboo and abolishes the
child’s primal and immediate relationship with
the mother through the agency of the Oedipus
complex. The foreclosure or suppression of this
basic signifier results in a gap in the symbolic
universe and is, in Lacan’s view, the factor that
triggers psychosis.

`narratology 
A theory of narrative based on
premises provided by Structuralism, especially
the work of the French structural anthropologist
Claude Lévi-Strauss on myth. For Lévi-Strauss
all myths are versions of basic themes, and the
narrative structures of individual myths relate
to a universal Structure which underpins all of
them. A myth is an instance of the operation of
this universal structure, a relationship which is
analogous to the distinction between Langue/
parole advanced by Ferdinand de Saussure. In

this scheme, a “mytheme” is an element of the
universal structure which can appear in different
mythic narratives. Lévi-Strauss reads myths in
reference to one another in order to uncover the
relations which structure their narrative. He
develops from this operation a theory of the
collective existence of certain elements, which he
then posits as being somehow prior to the mythic
narratives themselves, in a form of collective
consciousness.
Another fiqure crucial to the development of
narratology is Vladimir Propp, an exponent of
Russian formalism. He attempted to define
the narrative elements common to all folk tales
in a manner similar to that employed by LéviStrauss. Claude Bremond is a later narratologist
who most closely follows Propp, although he
attempts to account for moments of choice in
the narrative, moments which are structured by
a relation of difference to the discarded choices.
However, the search for a theory which has universal applications becomes most problematical
for those who follow Lévi-Strauss and Propp. A.J.
Greimas does attempt to achieve a universal
grammar of narrative by means of a type of
semantic analysis of sentence structure (see also
Actant). From this starting position, he produces
an analysis of characterization in the novel.
According to Greimas, characterization as a
whole is achieved by cumulative memorization.
The elements memorized are the various figurations attached to the name of the character at

narratology

N

narratology

different points in the Text. He attempts to
move from this psychological operation performed by the reader to an identification of the
discursive figurations which function to constitute the character. He therefore concentrates on
the production of an analysis of the text in which
the actant plays the role of the character. His
method is, essentially, to read character as the
product of a thematic relationship between the
grammatical subject position on the one hand, and
the thematic roles which qualify it on the other.
It is important to note that in his theory there is
a very specific relationship between the individual
occurrences of these thematic elements and the
discursive recognition of a character. Greimas
states that the movement from a narrative structure to a discursive structure takes place by means
of this very relationship. This happens when
actantial roles take control of thematic roles. His
introduction of the latter phrase has considerable
consequences for the development of narratology as a whole. It implies that there is not only a
multiplicity of levels in any given literary Text,
but that the relations between these levels are
subject to one set of binding rules. Discourse is,
for Greimas, the potentiality out of which certain
specific thematic roles are produced, and the
rules which govern this process are equivalent to
the relationship of langue/parole. His concept of
the textual actor functions to unite the specific
problematics of actant, actantial role, and thematic
role. This provides overall discursive recognitions such as the meanings associated with a
given character. The actor is a controlling nexus
because it functions in an actantial role and a
thematic role at the same time. By analyzing the
actor, the critic is therefore able to perform an
analysis of the relational structure which spans the
various textual levels. Greimas describes this
operation as a “transforming doing.” It provides
for the possibility of movement from one state,
or textual level, to another. This theory provides narratology with a concept for dealing with
the relations between narrative structure and
linguistic structure. Many further developments
in the field have taken place in terms of an
expansion of Greimas’s theory in this respect.
He has also had some effect on Semiotics, especially since his production of a science of narratology corresponds to the semiotic concept of
Metalanguage as constituting a Sign system in

itself. Nevertheless, one problem still exists for
this kind of theory, and that is the role played
by the reader. Greimas seems to assume that the
position of the reader is a simple unitary one,
but this problem becomes much more acute for
other narratologists.
In this way, for example, the Bulgarian theorist Tzvetan Todorov reads Les Liaisons dangereuses in accordance with the Greimas model by
utilizing the three sets of actants as the fundamental
relations between characters in any given narrative. Thus the combinations produced by desire,
communication, and participation determine the
“rules of action” used in the novel. For example,
if a person loves someone, then the interests
of the first person will be focused upon making
the second person return the love. But Todorov
is nevertheless aware of the problem of how to
guarantee objectivity in the production of such
a schematic. This results in a movement in his
later work away from this position, although his
intention is still the production of some sort of
universal grammar of narrative operations. He
attempts to produce a metalanguage which gives
objectively verifiable descriptions. This would
neatly sidestep the tendency of the critic to force
a text to produce the desired meanings, which
are then announced to have been present in
the text all the time. This metalanguage consists
of three “primary categories.” The first, “proper
names,” is comprised of grammatical subjects, but
without internal properties. The second, “adjectives,” is subdivided into states, properties, and
conditions. The last, “verbs,” is a category which
is capable of three actions: the modification of a
situation; the commitment of a crime; and the
punishing of a criminal. These three fundamental categories weave the text in and through a set
of five modes which are based upon the linguistic
classification of “mood.” The five modes are the
“indicative” (events or actions which actually
occurred); the “obligatory” (the legal obligations elaborated by society); the “optative” (the
character’s wishes); the “conditional” (if one
character performs a certain action, a second will
then perform another action); and the “predictive”
(at a certain moment in the narrative a specific
event shall occur). The meanings the reader
associates with certain characters are the result of
the syntactical conjunction of their grammatical
subject position with various predicates as the

471
meaning: the reader engages in a diacritical process with the literary. This leads to Barthes’s later
work, in which exactly what it is that constitutes
the literary itself is left undefined. For Barthes
there is no original idea, there is only intertextual
repetition. It is with regard to this most problematical area that Barthes’s contribution to
narratology is in fact only a stage in his own
development into a poststructuralist figure.
A further development in narrative theory
is the work of Fredric Jameson in The Political
Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act.
While not specifically a narratological work in that
it is more explicitly hostile to structuralism in general, it takes some of the theories of narratology
as its starting point. Greimas’s attempt to produce
a homogeneous theory of levels is one of the
main starting points of Jameson’s project, which
is no less than the construction of a Marxist
theory of narrative. Jameson focuses specifically
on Greimas’s concept of the semiotic rectangle,
reappropriating Greimas’s homological scheme
for his own purposes. In effect, he sees the static
nature of the concept, organized as it is around
Binary oppositions, as a very precise model for
the operation of ideological closure. He therefore
utilizes the semiotic rectangle in a critical practice
which analyzes the closure of meaning in the
literary text. Thus Jameson rejects the structuralist impulse toward the perception of objective
elements which is inherent in Greimas’s work.
Jameson states that this kind of theorizing of
closure permits an interrogation of the ideological system, one which will lay bare terms which
have been repressed by the closure performed
by the narrative. The reconstruction of these
repressed therms takes place in and through the
concept of the “political unconscious,” which
has the added advantage for Jameson of politicizing
psychoanalytical theories of the Unconscious.
Jameson criticizes Greimas’s theory for its inability to deal with the character, despite all of its
attempts to do so. He analyzes this inability as
an incapacity to theorize the Subject. He sees
Greimas’s problem in this respect as the result of
an ahistorical imposition of the bourgeois subject
upon narrative forms which predate the emergence
of the elements needed in the composition of this
subject: the Cartesian ego, the construction of a
differential relation between private and public,
the emergence of a canonical “literature,” and

narratology

text moves through the formulations posited by
Todorov. Thus the total effect of “character” is
gained by the associations produced by the relationship between the subject position associated
with a certain character on the one hand, and the
variations in the plot modes on the other. He constructs this entire metalanguage in the hope that
the insights gained by his theory of narrative
structure can be interrelated with an investigation of linguistic structure. The result should be
a complete understanding of the operation of
narration itself. As with many such basically
structuralist theories of narrative, however, no
attempt is made to theorize the relationship
between reader and text: Todorov’s theory simply assumes that the reader will be competent in
uncovering the structures.
Another theorist who attempts to develop a
science of narratology from the basic structuralist premise is Gérard Genette. He theorizes
narrative in terms of the relations between récit,
the order of events as they are represented in a
given narrative; histoire, the chronological order
in which the events occurred; and narration, the
narrative act itself. He pays minute attention to
categories of analysis such as the narrator and the
kind of voice or viewpoint he or she uses, and the
relationship of narrator to narratee. For Genette,
narrative is the result of the relations between these
various elements. He utilizes five basic areas
in which these elements interact: the narrative’s
ordering of time; the varying lengths of time
accorded to plot events by the narrative; the frequency with which an event is narrated as well
as the frequency with which it actually occurred;
the narrative techniques used and the viewpoint
of the narrative persona; and the act of narration
per se. Genette refers to the fact that other categories can exist, but his scheme at least enables
the essential difference between narration and
narrative to be grasped.
Narratology, however, is also an area of
structuralism which intersects most closely with
Poststructuralism. The works of Roland
Barthes examplify the way in which structuralism is problematized by what follows. In S/Z he
attempts a narratological analysis which does not
treat the literary text as the object of a disinterested scientific inquiry, thus marking a radical
break with the claims of structuralism. In this book
the function of the reader is the production of

nationalism, black

472
so on. Jameson utilizes Greimas’s theory at precisely the points at which it breaks down, that is,
when the narrative text deviates from Greimas’s
assumptions. This is especially important for
characters which are seen by Jameson to operate
as two actants. In this way he produces a rigorous methodology for the production of meanings
against the grain of ideological closure itself.
This operation of closure draws his attention to
the existence of the fundamental structuralist
concept of binary opposition as it is used by
Greimas. Jameson rereads binary opposition as the
very model of social contradiction, and it is this
which is managed by the literary text. Jameson
utilizes narratological theory in order to change it
into something else. His theory marks one point
at which narratology intersects with Marxism and
marxist criticism. Narratology must therefore
be seen in relation to developments in critical and
cultural theory other than structuralism.

`Native American studies 
The literatures of
American Indian peoples represent an integral
part of Native American studies. Creation and
emergence myths, etiological myths, ceremonial
chants and prayers, legends, and historical narratives embodied in various oral traditions have
provided traditional listeners with the collective
cultural wisdom that maintains order and con-

trol in the universe, and they afford the nonIndian listeners/readers insight into the respective
tribe’s world view. These oral Texts reveal the
people’s moral and aesthetic values, relation to
the natural world and spiritual powers, views of
the landscape as a numinous and living entity,
methods of controlling evil and disease, and,
perhaps most important, they provide the community with a sense of identity by making the
past a viable part of the present by affirming
the mythic and historic links to a sacred tribal
geography.
Oral literatures are not only an important
field of study in their own right, but essential for
the student of Native American literature written
in English. One of the many accomplishments of
contemporary Indian writers such as N. Scott
Momaday (Kiowa), Louise Erdrich (Ojibwa),
and Leslie Marmon Silko (Laguna Pueblo) is the
conscious continuation of the oral tradition in
their fictions. This requires readers to be not only
aware of the oral quality of their writings and the
sacred role of language in oral Cultures, but also
to employ a broadly interdisciplinary approach
to their texts by drawing on relevant materials
from anthropology, tribal mythology, religion,
and history. Reading Momaday’s House Made of
Dawn, for instance, requires an understanding of
the curative function of the Navajo Night Chant,
from which the novel takes its title, insight into
the Bear Maiden myth’s relation to the novel’s
plot, knowledge of the ritual function of Pueblo
ceremonial races, and careful, culture-specific
readings of such symbols as the moon and the dawn,
which are essential for an accurate interpretation
of the novel’s conclusion. If Momaday’s works
invite research into their Navajo, Kiowa, and
Jemez Pueblo backgrounds, the critics of Leslie
Silko’s writing must explore Navajo and Laguna
Pueblo cultures. To appreciate fully the complexity of Ceremony, one must delineate the parallels between the Laguna emergence story and the
protagonist’s mythic quest. Anthropological and
ethnographic studies help critics recognize the roles
of Spiderwoman and katchina figures in Laguna
mythology and the significance of directional
and color symbolism within the Laguna sacred
geography. Moreover, this novel is perhaps the
best example in contemporary Native American
literature of how the oral tradition provides a
mythical matrix which determines individual lives

473

Native American Indian literatures are unstudied
landscapes, wild and comic rather than tragic and
representational, storied with narrative wisps
and tribal discourse. Social science theories
constrain tribal landscapes to institutional values,
representationalism and the politics of academic
determination. The narrow teleologies deduced
from social science monologues and the ideologies that arise from structuralism have reduced
tribal literatures to an “objective” collection of
consumable artifacts. Postmodernism liberates
imagination and widens the audience for tribal
literatures; this new criticism rouses a comic
world view, narrative discourse and language
games on the past. (Vizenor, 1989)

Arnold Krupat, in his Preface to For Those
Who Come After: A Study of Native American
Autobiography, faults postmodern critics for concentrating on established canonical texts, “thus
miss[ing] out on some extraordinary opportunities to test and apply their ideas” to Native
American literatures (1985). He is more blunt in
his judgment of conventional critics, or “literary

pragmatists,” as he calls them, whom he accuses
of allowing themselves “to carry on at some
virtually pretechnological level of critical naiveté;
the amount of unself-conscious twaddle about
plots and characters and the poetry of place that
goes on at the literary end of Native American
studies would never be tolerated in the study
of, say, Faulkner or William Carlos Williams, of
Emily Dickinson or Thoreau” (1985). Despite
such harsh words, Krupat’s purpose is finally to
encourage Native Americanists and theorists to
join forces.
Krupat’s own study of Native American
autobiography, For Those Who Come After, is an
excellent example of how modern theory can
enhance our understanding of Native American
writing. His opening chapter, “An approach to
Native American texts,” is indispensable reading.
However, his “The dialogic of Silko’s storyteller,”
which is included in Gerald Vizenor’s Narrative
Chance: Postmodern Discourse on Native American Indian Literatures (1989), reveals some of
the problems of privileging theory at the expense
of close textual analysis. In this article, Arnold
Krupat offers a Bakhtinian reading of Silko’s
text which he treats as autobiographical writing.
While Bakhtin’s views of language as “heteroglossic” and “polyvocal” are helpful in describing
Silko’s use of multiple voices and story variants,
the fluidity of the storytelling, and the dialogic
character of her discourse, one may ask whether
the application of Bakhtinian theory truly reveals
anything that Silko, who carefully instructs the
reader in the nature of oral Discourse, does not
already convey without the ballast of technical
jargon, and whether this kind of reading does
not overburden the primary text unnecessarily.
Perhaps Krupat’s own comment that Native
American literatures offer postmodern critics
opportunities “to test and apply their ideas”
(1985) is a hint that his approach remains focused
primarily on the theory itself, rather than on the
illumination of the primary text by the application of theory.
Krupat’s treatment of Silko’s title story, “Storyteller,” is a useful example of how a careful
structuralist analysis can render the theoretical
approach more fruitful. Even if Krupat considered an exhaustive reading beyond the scope
of the article, the story’s centrality, not only to
Storyteller as a whole but also to his Bakhtinian

Native American studies

and events across generations. In Tracks, Louise
Erdrich draws heavily on Ojibwa myth in her portrayal of Nanapush as the modern incarnation of
the traditional trickster figure, as well as in her
linkage of the lake monster, the Misshepeshu, to
Fleur’s, the female protagonist’s, supernatural
powers. These examples illustrate that readers
of Native American literatures must accept the
challenge of crossing cultural boundaries and
immerse themselves in the study of culturespecific background materials. This will lead not
only to insights into other cultures’ modes of
knowledge, but also create a fruitful distance
from which one’s own cultural assumptions can
be critically reevaluated.
It must be noted, however, that the approach
to Native American texts outlined above has
come under attack by postmodern critics, most
notably by Gerald Vizenor and Arnold Krupat.
Vizenor, a widely published Ojibwa novelist and
critic, contends that critics in the past have relied
too heavily on Structuralism and other social
science theories in their interpretations of Native
American literary Texts (Vizenor, 1989). In the
following statement he articulates his objections
to these critical strategies and calls for new
approaches to American Indian texts:

naturalization (vraisemblance)

perspective, surely would have warranted more
than the brief observation that “The storyteller of
the title is the protagonist’s grandfather, a rather
less benign figure than the old storyteller of
Silko’s biographical experience; nonetheless, the
stories he tells are of the traditional, mythic type”
(Krupat, 1989). Indeed, “Storyteller” offers an
opportunity to integrate theory and “pragmatic,”
in this case mythic and Symbolic analysis.
As I noted in “What other story?: mythic
subtexts in Leslie Silko’s ‘Storyteller,’” the old
man (Krupat mistakenly assumes he is the young
woman’s grandfather) is by no means the only
storyteller – the grandmother, the female protagonist, and the omniscient narrative voice that
has mysteriously survived the story’s final glacial
cataclysm are others – nor is his bear narrative
the dominating discourse in the story. Silko
explicitly contrasts the old man’s storytelling
with another story with which the female protagonist must acquaint herself to understand her
role fully. These features of the story fit precisely
Bakhtin’s notion of the heteroglossic and polyvocal nature of language as well as his idea that
“All there is to know about the world is not
exhausted by a particular discourse about it”
(quoted in Krupat, 1989). In fact, at the heart of
“Storyteller” are the conflicting claims of the old
man’s story, which anticipates the final winter for
the white exploiters only, and those of the mythic
subtexts, which foretell the end of humankind as
punishment for the global destruction they have
wrought.
The analysis of the story’s references to
traditional Eskimo doomsday myths and a close
reading of its apocalyptic symbolism reveal that
the overt theme of Culture clash is secondary
to Silko’s ecological concerns, lending support
to Krupat’s claim that one of Native American
literature’s central premises is “that a global,
ecosystemic perspective is the necessary condition
of human survival and that such a perspective
prohibits anthropocentrism” (1985).
The many fine contributions to Gerald
Vizenor’s Narrative Chance offer ample evidence
that modern critical approaches have already
shed new light on Native American literature.
However, as my brief discussion of “Storyteller”
shows, theory is no substitute for close textual analysis, nor is it helpful to assert the supremacy of
advanced literary theory over more traditional

approaches if Krupat’s goal of a “rapprochement
between the two separate camps of theorists and
Native Americanists” (1985), with all its potential for the future study of Native American literature, is to be realized.

`naturalization (vraisemblance) 
A method
of interpretation by which the work is related to
the cultural order as a whole: a term utilized
often in Structuralism. With regard to the literary Text, this operation can be viewed
as the domestication of a potentially disruptive
text by a dominant literary order, or as the process of assimilation by which the great literary
tradition renews itself. When the process is
compete, the text seems “naturally” to display
meanings which accord with the tradition as a
whole. Structuralist critics tend to see the process
of naturalization as an inherent operation of the
human mind.

of those researchers, Lu Gui-zhen, became his lifelong companion (within the bounds of an “open
marriage” with his wife Dorothy Moyle – herself
a biochemist admitted to the Royal Society),
language teacher, intellectual collaborator, and,
after the death of Moyle in 1987, his second wife.
A vociferous and vocal critic of the Japanese
incursion in China, Needham was appointed in
1942 as director of the newly established SinoBritish Co-operation Office based in the provisional capital, Chongqing. During the next four
years, Needham and his travel companion and later
collaborator, the historian Wang Ling, embarked
upon a series of remarkable journeys through
western, northwestern, and southern China with
the ostensible objective of providing encouragement and, when possible, supplies and instrumentation to scientific researchers at universities
struggling under a nationalist government in
contention with both Japanese invaders/occupiers
and a growing communist insurgency.
Having already conceived of his project of
documenting China’s long history of scientific
and technical innovation, Needham took full
advantage of his diplomatic status and mission to
pursue and collect during his four years in China
the vast quantities of primary materials and
texts upon which his future work would depend.
Narrowly escaping capture by the Japanese,
Needham (still broadly known in China today
by his Chinese name Li Yue-se) made lifelong
friendships with a wide spectrum of Chinese
scientists, intellectuals and politicians in both
the nationalist and communist camps (the latter
of whose political values and objectives he privately endorsed), including Mao Ze-dong and, in
particular, Zhou En-lai.
Upon return to Britain in 1946, Needham was
recruited by his Cambridge colleague, the biologist Julian Huxley, to lead the Natural Sciences
Division of the newly established United Nations
Educational and Cultural Organization, which – as
a result of Needham’s intense lobbying – became
UNESCO, with the addition of “scientific” to its
name.
After completing his tenure at UNESCO in
1948, Needham returned to Cambridge and his
teaching post, at which time he secured partial
funding for the Science and Civilisation in China
series from Cambridge University Press, which
doggedly supported the massive, ever-expanding

Needham, Joseph

`Needham, Joseph (1900–96) 
Author and
editor of the massive encyclopedic historical survey of scientific innovation in China, Science and
Civilisation in China, Joseph Needham, already
an accomplished biochemist before beginning
the project in the early 1950s, became a central
figure in introducing Western audiences to the
breadth and scope of the scientific and material
cultural production of China.
Originally conceived as a single volume
examination of “why modern science originated
in Europe and not in China,” by the time of its
completion (eight years after Needham’s death)
the work had expanded to a twenty-volume,
seemingly comprehensive, compendium of existing knowledge of virtually all aspects of scientific
innovation in China. Published over a fifty-year
period, the work was completed by collaborators
recruited by Needham, working under the direction of the Needham Institute at Cambridge
University.
Born in London in 1900, Needham was the
only child of a Scottish physician whose strong
Fabian socialist views, in combination with a
singular emphasis on instilling in his son the
importance of embracing an unrelenting pursuit
of the acquisition of knowledge, formed the
basis for what was to become Needham’s lifelong
indefatigable work ethic, broad intellectual curiosity, and radical leftist political beliefs.
Needham turned away from a planned career
as a surgeon – which he considered too intellectually limiting – and graduated from Cambridge
with a doctorate in biochemistry in 1925. Recruited to work in F.G. Hopkin’s laboratory
at Caius College, his research on embryology
and morphogenesis rapidly established him as a
leading figure in biochemistry, resulting in two
seminal works within the field, Chemical Embryology and A History of Embryology, and election to
the Royal Society in 1941.
Needham was an individual of intense and
eclectic enthusiasms (which included rural English
Morris folk dancing, nudism, and a form of radical Christian socialism – all three of which he was
willing to demonstrate if mildly prompted), and
a turning point in his life occurred in the 1930s
when three Chinese researchers were recruited to
work in his lab, initiating what was to be a lifelong passion for the study of the Chinese language,
and subsequently, Chinese history and culture. One

Needham, Joseph

project for the next half-century. During this
initial period of writing (the first volume, coauthored with Wang Ling, appeared in 1954),
Needham was recruited by Zhou En-lai to head
a commission to investigate charges of American
use of biological weapons in Korea. Needham,
who naively endorsed what proved to be spurious
claims by the Chinese, suffered greatly at the
time from extremely negative reaction in Britain
and the USA (to which he could not travel for
an extended period) to his role in the affair – a
reaction he lived with until his “rehabilitation” at
Cambridge in the 1960s.
Over the course of five decades of creation,
Needham remained faithful to the early organizational aspirations he established for Science
and Civilisation in China. The work comprises
seven volumes, the last four of which are divided
into “parts” that, in the aggregate, account for
the series’ twenty individual works. The first
two volumes (completed with the acknowledged
“collaboration” or “research assistance” of Wang
Ling), provide a contextual introduction to the
history of scientific inquiry in general, and China
in particular.
As Needham and his colleagues began the
laborious task of examining and evaluating the
immense collection of materials (now housed at
the Needham Institute) he had accumulated in
his rooms at Gaius College, the scope of the work
continued to balloon. Thus, the introductory
volumes were followed by subject-specific works
on mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, nautics [sic], and a massive examination of
chemistry and chemical technology inclusive of
twelve separate “parts” spanning subjects from
paper and printing through alchemy, military
technology, metallurgy, textiles, ceramics, and
mining.
As the magnitude of the work grew, so did
Needham’s need of assistance – the initial collaboration of Wang Ling and Lu Gui-zhen
expanded to include a diverse range of academics
specializing in specific subject areas contributing to or authoring “parts” of volumes that
were often published as they were completed, as
opposed to the original sequence of the master
organization.
Critical reaction to the initial volumes could
only be characterized as extremely positive, if
not ecstatic, both within the academy as well as

in the popular press – in many ways retrieving a
reputation in both venues damaged by Needham’s
unfortunate Korean “biological warfare” episode.
The remaining volumes include the subject areas
of biology, botany, agriculture, forestry, food
science, and medicine, with the “final” (it is not
clear whether or not the Needham Institute plans
future additions) work, which appeared in 2004,
focusing on language, logic, and “general conclusions and reflections.”
Needham’s method of discovery and documentation was, in a sense, similar to the Oxford
English Dictionary’s utilization of chronological
citations from primary texts to provide, in effect,
an evocative and accurate aggregated definition
of a term or subject. It is of interest to note, as
reported in Simon Winchester’s biography (2008)
of Needham, that a major source of material
for the work was the unanticipated gift of the
massive Qing dynasty imperial encyclopedia The
Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of
Ancient and Modern Times (Gujin tushu jicheng).
In light of this information, one might ask to what
degree did Needham’s belief that a universally
comprehensive historical survey could actually
be produced (an impulse surely shared by the Ming
and Qing dynasty chroniclers he seemed to rely
upon) dictate that his work be overly dependent
upon putatively inclusive and credible Chinese
compilations and redactions that have proven to
be of ambivalent value as historically accurate texts?
Critics of Science and Civilisation in China
more often cite what seems to be the inherently
deterministic quality of the work, the fact that
Needham’s inquiry became less one of revealing
innovation when it was reliably encountered in
the historical record than one of having sought
out – in an exhaustive (some would say obsessive)
and possibly uncritical manner – any evidence of
chronological precedence of scientific and technological discovery in comparison with advancements in the West. Similar observations have been
made challenging the intrinsic value, or at least the
fundamental relevance or utility, of Needham’s
foundational question of why Chinese scientific
advancement was eclipsed by the scientific and
technical “revolutions” of the West.
Those critical caveats notwithstanding, most
are confident that Needham’s protean work will
endure as a singular achievement of intellectual
inquiry – a revealing, reliable, expansive, and

discuss both the narrow and broad usages, since
both are necessary for a complete understanding
of the concept.

`negative dialectics 
A phrase popularized by
Adorno (1966), referring to a contradictory process of reflection between thought and its object
which is never finally resolved into the identity
of a true knowledge. It was originally used to
describe the structure of Plato’s early “Socratic”
dialogs. These function to draw attention to the
ignorance of all the participants, rather than to
show the superiority of any particular point of
view. Adorno uses it to describe a materialist
version of Kant’s dialectic, in which it is the
limits to knowledge which are at issue, rather
than a Socratic skepticism about knowledge as
such.

`neo-Darwinism 
A term narrowly understood
as the synthesis of Mendelian genetics and
Darwinian theory and broadly understood as the
current paradigm of evolutionary theory.
As this brief definition suggests, neo-Darwinism
is a somewhat imprecise concept. It is difficult to
provide a single definition since neo-Darwinism
can be understood in a variety of ways, given
its narrow and broad construals. In the narrow
conception, neo-Darwinism is simply the combination or reconciliation of Darwin’s theory of
natural selection with Mendel’s theory of genetics. Under the broad conception, on the other
hand, neo-Darwinism is an umbrella term for work
done in contemporary evolutionary theory, i.e.
how the various fields of biology, from genetics

Narrow Usage Prior to the popularization of
genetics as outlined by Gregor Mendel, it was
thought that traits were “blended,” like colors of
paint. This theory, however, is incompatible with
Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection.
Darwin provided three conditions for evolution
by natural selection: (1) heredity, (2) variation,
and (3) differential reproduction (the ability for
organisms to reproduce at different rates, hence
some flourish more than others). A theory of
blending traits, however, reduces variation over
time; or, to render it in terms of the metaphor,
particular traits or “colors” blend until they produce a gray amalgam. This clearly violates
Darwin’s second condition, and poses a serious
problem for Darwin’s overall theory, because
without variation, natural selection has nothing
to act upon. Therefore, Darwin understood that
there must be particular traits that are inherited
from one generation to the next, allowing for variation in traits to persist. However, Darwin failed
to produce a viable alternative to the blending
theory that would explain the continued variation
observed in nature.
Although Mendel provided an alternative to the
blending theory while Darwin was still alive (and
sent him a copy), much to history’s dismay,
Darwin never read it. Mendel’s alternative to the
“blending” theory is specified by his two laws: the
Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent
Assortment. The first law states that an individual possesses two copies of one gene: one
maternal and one paternal. So, for instance, if my
father has brown eyes, he might have two dominant copies of brown, and if my mother has blue
eyes, then she must have two recessive copies
of blue. I, however, would not have a blend of
brown and blue eyes; I would simply have brown
eyes because brown is a dominant and particulate trait. The second law states that the two gene
copies (alleles) separate independently during
gamete formation. Or, rather, if my mother has
blue eyes and brown hair and my father has
brown eyes and blond hair, just because I have
brown eyes does not necessarily mean I will have

blond hair as well. Mendel’s claim is that traits
are inherited independently of one another, as
particulate traits.
Surprisingly, during Darwin’s time, and for
some time thereafter, Mendel’s theory of inheritance was understood as an alternative to
Darwinian theory. Darwin’s theory focused on the
changing probabilities of traits in a population,
via natural selection, from one generation to the
next, while Mendel’s theory seemed to focus on
traits remaining static over time (brown eyes will
always be inherited as brown eyes). Overlooked
was Mendel’s idea of mutation, which caused variation; however, he did not integrate that with
Darwin’s theory of natural selection. Darwin, conversely, had no working theory of inheritance
or explanation of the variation he saw in nature
to supplement his theory of natural selection.
Although Darwin’s theory of natural selection
doesn’t require a specific mechanism (just a
mechanism) of inheritance, Darwin still proposed
“pangenesis” (1868), an error-ridden theory,
which held that each and every cell contributed
“gemmules” to the reproductive organs in order
for traits to be passed on. This theory, however,
allowed for heritability of acquired characteristics
(as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck argued), and is one of
the reasons it is discounted today.
The term “neo-Darwinism” was coined in 1895
by Georg Romanes, specifically to oppose the idea
of the heritability of acquired characteristics. For
Romanes, neo-Darwinism referred to Weismann’s
theory of germ plasms (or gametes), which are the
essential parts of germ cells. Germ cells are distinct from body cells, because they are inherited.
Since only germ cells can contribute to the next
generation, acquired characteristics cannot be
selected for. Weismann’s explanation of inheritance without acquired characteristics is compatible with Darwin’s theory of natural selection,
and was necessary for Mendel’s theory to be
revisited at the end of the nineteenth century.
It was at that point that the theories of Mendel
and Darwin were integrated. Mendel’s theory
solved Darwin’s problem of where much of the
variation in nature comes from, by means of
genetic mutations, and Darwin’s theory explained
directed change in nature as adaptations. Current
science now regards Mendel’s theory as a precursor
to modern genetics, and recognizes that natural
selection acts on variation at the genetic level.

Broad Usage Neo-Darwinism can also refer to our
current paradigm of evolutionary theory, which
stemmed in large part from the modern synthesis. The “modern synthesis” is a term coined
by Julian Huxley (1942), and refers to a time in
science from the mid-1930s to the mid-1940s.
Some of the more important contributors include
J.B.S. Haldane, Sewell Wright, R.A. Fisher,
Gaylord Simpson, Ernst Mayr, T. Dobzhansky, and
G. Ledyard Stebbins. It was during the modern
synthesis that the field of population genetics
developed, which took ideas at the genetic level
and fused them with the idea of evolution
observed at the population level, driven by natural selection. Before the modern synthesis, it
was hard to reconcile genetics with real world
examples of natural selection.
An example of this synthesis can be seen
in J.B.S. Haldane’s general selection model, a
mathematical analysis of how certain genotypes
change from one generation to the next based
on natural selection. His mathematical analysis
explains the underlying genetics behind real
world examples. For instance, there is the famous
example of peppered (melanic) moths that is
taught in most population biology classes today.
In a normal forest near London around 1848, lightcolored moths flourished because they blended
in with the light-colored environment. Predators
were more likely to eat darker-colored moths
that stood out, and therefore the light-colored
moth genotype was passed on. However, by 1895,
there was an increase in the frequency of darkcolored moths because of pollution from the
Industrial Revolution. The dark-colored moth
genotype became more prevalent because they
camouflaged with the darker trees and predators
ate the light moths that now stood out. Haldane
calculated an increase of dark-colored moths,
from 2 to 95 percent of the population over the
47 years. This change was so fast, he concluded,
that only natural selection could have caused it.
This case is wonderful because it shows an easily
understood example of adaptation at the population level as well as the underlying genes of the
dark- and light-colored moths that were inherited
from one generation to the next. Both the theory
of natural selection at the population level and
the theory of natural selection at the genetic level
are consistent. Neo-Darwinism, then, can refer to
science after the modern synthesis – we are able

479

Criticisms of the Term Neo-Darwinism Ernst
Mayr, one of the founders of the modern synthesis,
writes that, “the term neo-Darwinism for the
[modern] synthetic theory is wrong, because the
term neo-Darwinism was coined by Romanes
in 1895 as a designation of Weismann’s theory”
(Mayr, 1984, p. 146). This view, advanced by Mayr,
restricts the usage of the term “neo-Darwinism” to
its narrow sense, as Romanes originally intended
it. However, despite such opposition, the broad
construal of neo-Darwinism has seen widespread
acceptance and use, especially in popular writings.
For example, the New York Times journalist and
evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson recently
wrote that terms such as “neo-Darwinism,” or even
simply “Darwinism” are misleading for biology.
If biologists are working under a neo-Darwinian
paradigm, then it can be said of physicists, for
example, that they are doing “neo-Einsteinism.”
Obviously she understands neo-Darwinism to
refer to our current paradigm of evolutionary
science – otherwise there would not be the distaste. Like Mayr, Judson might agree with calling
the modern synthesis just that, and our current
paradigm simply “evolutionary biology.” NeoDarwinism, then, would be relegated to its historical usage, a word that reminds us of a period
during which Mendel and Darwin’s theories
were at odds.

`neo-Kantianism 
This was the dominant current in German philosophy at the turn of the
twentieth century and was influential across the
humanities and social sciences. It originated in a
“return to Kant” in the mid-nineteenth century,
following a period of Hegelian and neo-Fichtean
Hegemony over the intellectual direction and
institutions of German philosophy. The neoKantians may be divided into the “Marburg” and
“Heidelberg schools,” each of which pursued a
distinct interpretation of Kant. The Marburg
school represented by Hermann Cohen emphasized the theme of validity, what it was that made
judgments valid, while the Heidelberg school
represented by Rickert and Lask focused upon the
creation of value: the former may be described
as an “objective,” the latter as a “subjective”
idealism.
The main impact of neo-Kantianism on
Cultural theory was in the areas of the sociology, the history of Art, and the history of
ideas. The sociologists of art influenced by this
current of thought were Georg Simmel, Max
Weber, and Georg Lukács. They all inclined
toward the subjective idealism of the Heidelberg
school, although Weber combined aspects of
both traditions. Simmel’s work in the sociology
of art included studies of Rembrandt, Rodin,
and other contemporary artists, and emphasized the tension between the active creation of
meaning or “life” and its presentation in “form.”
Weber’s study of the sociology of music is
ostensibly less indebted to the metaphysical side
of neo-Kantianism, and was dedicated to tracing
the impact of the rationalization of the form
and content of social life on the organization
and technology of music. Lukács’s pre-Marxist
neo-Kantian period prior to the 1914–18 war
was represented in his Heidelberg Aesthetics. This
attempted to answer the pseudo-Kantian question,
“We have works of art, how are they possible?” by
reference to a “pure doctrine of validity” which
was neither “metaphysical” nor “psychologistic,”
but which pointed toward a sociology of art.
Most of the neo-Kantian-inspired sociology
of art from the early twentieth century is now
largely of antiquarian or specialist interest, in
contrast to the continuing significance of the
debates it inspired in art history. The Heidelberg
school was represented in art history by the
work of Wilhelm Worringer in Abstraction and

neo-Kantianism

to apply genetics to natural populations, whether
those populations are communities, species, or
clades. In this respect most current research in
biology hinges on evolutionary theory in some way,
and falls under the term neo-Darwinism.

The New Criterion

480
Empathy (1907) and Form in Gothic (1912),
works influenced above all by Georg Simmel.
Worringer presented the theoretical bases of his
historical analysis in strictly neo-Kantian terms,
considering “form” as the synthetic construction
of a subjective “artistic will” striving to express
itself. As opposed to the subjective idealism of the
Heidelberg school manifest in Worringer, the
emphasis of the Marburg school on objective
idealism, or the validity of form beyond the accidents of history and culture, is embodied in the
work of Heinrich Wölfflin. Wölfflin’s art history
concentrated on the formal similarities manifest
in a genre or the work of an artist, for example,
in his study The Art of Albrecht Dürer (1905)
which rests on the general “Kantian” claim that
each artist possesses a particular categorical structure of perception, and the more specific claim
that the structure of perception possessed by
Dürer consisted of the transposition of natural
phenomena into line. The study traces this
transposition, or act of formal synthesis, through
selected works of the artist. This formalist
approach to art history, shorn of any explicit
reference to its philosophical basis in neoKantianism, continues to exert a significant
influence on the discipline.
One of the most enduringly influential
examples of Marburg neo-Kantianism is in the
approach to the history of ideas developed by Ernst
Cassirer. His works on the Renaissance and the
Enlightenment have had considerable influence
on the emergence of the discipline of the history
of ideas in the United States. His writings evince
a fascinating tension between the neo-Kantian
formalist impulse and the necessary confusion of
historical source materials. When successful, the
result is an extremely stimulating and coherent
presentation of historical evidence; but when
unsuccessful, the presentation becomes formally
schematic and the citation of historical evidence
somewhat aimless.
The main contribution of neo-Kantianism
lies less in its own logical and metaphysical
investigations of validity and values than in the
influence it exerted upon surrounding disciplines.
Its analysis of form provided an important principle for the construction of historical narratives
in sociology, art history, and the history of ideas.
However, the use of this formal principle for the
organization of historical materials brought with

it the threat of a reversion to its neo-Kantian
origins as a subjective or objective idealism. For
this reason a great deal of recent work in
Cultural Studies has self-consciously distanced
itself from “Formalism” and “idealism” without,
however, engaging theoretically with their shared
neo-Kantian origins.

`The New Criterion
 Made distraught by the
state of intellectual discourse, a group of neoconservatives established The New Criterion in
1982. In their opening pages the editors set the
pace for what continues today to be a dissenting
voice in Literary and art criticism; they painted
a dismal picture of the academic world, accusing
journals and institutions of deliberately failing to
uphold certain standards of quality in academic
and critical work and of being influenced by prevailing left-wing political attitudes. They wrote:
“Today, more often than not, the prevailing
modes of criticism have not only failed to come
to grips with such tasks, they have actually come
to constitute an obstacle to their pursuit.” The
founding editors saw it as their task to challenge
the “sheer trendiness” of radical theorists, and so
in September 1982 they established a journal “to
apply a new criterion to the discussion of our our
cultural life – a criterion of truth.”
The journal espouses a conservative, traditional outlook on art and literature; the articles
which appear monthly in The New Criterion typically challenge what the editors see as a dangerous
“new wave of thought,” sometimes with hostile
attacks on other journals. The 1982 opening
remarks touched on the editors’ criticism of Art
History for being “programmatic”; even later,
Roger Kimball, who joined the editorial board as
managing editor in November 1989, lambasted
October, a journal founded in 1976 on the belief
that economic and social concerns set the context
for art and criticism, for “combining fashionable
academic jargon with radical political ideology.”

`New Criticism 
An American critical movement. Originating in the 1920s in the early work
of T.S. Eliot, I.A. Richards, and John Crowe
Ransom, New Criticism became a self-conscious
campaign at the end of the 1930s, and the dominant form of American academic criticism in the
1940s and 1950s. It is a notoriously slippery and
contested term, but there is general agreement
that Ransom, Allen Tate, and Cleanth Brooks
(see individual entries) were its leading figures and
that New Criticism’s distinguishing feature was a
style of close verbal analysis in which each Text
was treated as a self-contained or “autotelic”
structure. The New Critics called this “intrinsic”
analysis, and it turned out to be extremely
problematic, even self-contradictory, both as a
concept and in their practice and influence. A
truly “intrinsic” criticism would be an extreme
Formalism and, although that was what it
degenerated into when New Criticism became an
institutionalized orthodoxy, its founding fathers
were anything but formalists. They were motivated
by a deep concern with the world beyond the text,
passionate Arnoldian crusaders for Culture
against anarchy. Hence the paradox that their
adversaries have attacked them both for teaching
students artificially to isolate texts from history
and, simultaneously, for preaching a pessimistic
and nostalgic vision of history to those same
students. Both charges have some validity. The
New Critics could never decide whether they

wanted literature to be a sanctuary from history,
a closed model of order, or combatively engagé.
The roots of this paradox lie in the movement’s own history. Like several other influential
critical schools, notably that of F.R. Leavis in
England, New Criticism’s story is that of a failed
political movement which, checked in its wider
ambitions, retreated to the academy and textual
analysis. The founding fathers were part of the
“Southern Renaissance” and had been members first of the Fugitives and then of the
Southern Agrarians, promoting an idealized
vision of the rural Old South as an alternative
to the industrial North and all the forces of
dehumanizing modern science and technology
which it represented. When their “back to the
land” campaign was unsuccessful, they returned
to their literature departments and transformed
their cultural politics into Literary criticism.
Ransom, the New Critics’ chief guru, was perfectly
explicit about this. In launching their campaign,
he told Allen Tate, “our cue would be to stick to
literature entirely. There’s no consistent, decent
group writing in politics . . . in the severe field
of letters there is vocation enough for us.” The
only way of returning to the order of the past
was now “formally,” through art and literature,
and after the “red fury” of agrarianism had died
away, he and his comrades in arms retreated for
this purpose to a “minority pocket of the culture,”
that is, to “educational institutions, with pockets
of ‘humanities,’ whose interest has identified
itself increasingly with ours.” This was not a
retreat to the individual contemplative life and the
monastic cell, however. One form of organized
propaganda campaign was simply exchanged for
another. In his influential essay “Criticism, Inc.,”
Ransom called belligerently for “a new order
of studies: the speculative or critical ones” as
opposed to the ruling orthodoxy of historical
scholarship: “now it is the Age of Criticism.” As
with the Leavisites in England, this was to be a
war of the critics against the scholars, and it was
fought with great determination and institutional
effectiveness, starting with Ransom’s founding
of The Kenyon Review in 1939 (soon followed
by the revamped Southern Review, The Sewanee
Review, and The Hudson Review), and backed
up with numerous undergraduate workbooks
(Brooks’s Understanding Poetry has probably been
the best-selling critical work of the century),

New Criticism

Other New Criterion articles have presented
critical examinations of aspects of the art world,
art movements, and museums. In 1984 an entire
issue of the journal was devoted to the reopening of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
The journal also prints articles on literary and
cultural criticism; Kimball, a prolific contributor,
has submitted articles ranging from a discussion
of Terry Eagleton to one entitled “Debating the
humanities at Yale.” In September 1989, the editors added a section called “Notes & Comments.”
In each issue, they present in this section a short
discussion of current issues. The topic of the
first “Notes & Comments” was Mapplethorpe
and the NEA; they argued for “re-thinking of the
proper purposes of federal support for culture and
the proper mission of the NEA.”

revisionist histories such as Brooks’s Modern
Poetry and the Tradition, the Kenyon Review Fellowships and especially with the Kenyon School
of English and the Gauss Seminars at Princeton,
summer schools whose purpose was to train the
new critical cadres to throw into the frontline
against the scholars. The aim was to take over
English studies in America and they were brilliantly
successful.
The aesthetic effects of this history were
marked. Just as F.R. Leavis explicitly offered his
style of criticism as a substitute for a vanished
“organic community,” so Ransom argued, “The
little world [poetry] sets up is a little version
of our natural world in its original dignity, not
the laborious world of affairs. Indeed, the little
world is the imitation of our ancient Paradise,
when we inhabited it in innocence,” and on this
logic it followed inevitably that criticism too
should be postlapsarian and backward-looking,
offering the poem as a microcosm of and a compensation for a lost Edenic order.
The agrarians’ political terminology had to be
aestheticized in the process, but that was not
difficult to achieve: organicist metaphors could be
easily shifted from the Old South to lyric poems
if you did not think too hard about them or the
category confusions that were likely to result,
and in any case they did not have to invent a new
vocabulary. One was already to hand in the work
not only of Ransom himself but also in that of
T.S. Eliot and I.A. Richards, the patron saints
of the movement. Eliot in particular had already
prepared the way in his early essays, which slid
continually between close textual criticism and
grand synoptic historical generalizations, and
many of the New Critics’ central statements were
reworkings of the most notorious instance of
this elision, Eliot’s theory of the Dissociation
of sensibility, in which he extrapolated from
close verbal analysis of Donne’s poetry to a generalization about “something that happened to
the mind of England” in the seventeenth century,
when, under the pressure of the new science
and religious skepticism, the unified medieval
culture was finally lost. The New Critics seized
eagerly on the analogy between Eliot’s imaginary
Renaissance moment and their own. Allen Tate
suggested that the Southern Renaissance was
like, “on an infinitesimal scale, the outburst of
poetic genius at the end of the sixteenth century,

when commercial England had begun to crush
feudal England.” The two Fall myths could be
amalgamated.
I.A. Richards’ influence reinforced Eliot’s. In his
work the New Critics found another meditation
on order and its loss, another attempt to counter
the “chaos” of the modern world with literary
models of equilibrium and unified sensibility,
and they appropriated many of his terms.
Richards had, for instance, offered Irony as one
of the highest forms of harmonious integration
and proposed that it “might provide a kind of test
of the value of poetry,” while Ransom went even
further to define irony as “the ultimate mode
of the great minds . . . the rarest of the states of
mind, because it is the most inclusive,” and the
term became a New Critical keyword. Richards
had praised the harmonious interactions of
multiple levels of meaning in the best poetry; his
insights were developed in his pupil William
Empson’s concept of Ambiguity, and this too
became a sine qua non of the best poetry. One
student trained at the Kenyon School of English
recalled, “Vigorously, we ‘explicated’ in and out
of class . . . and where we couldn’t find an ambiguity we made one.” A whole lexicon of cognate
terms, such as Brooks’s “Paradox” and Tate’s
“Tension,” followed.
The typical New Critical “intrinsic reading”
thus made no pretense to be value-free, a kind
of neutral empirical technique. It was highly
a-prioristic. It attempted to demonstrate the
qualities of ironic or paradoxical “wit” in the
poetry it admired (and it found these mainly
in poetry; it was notably unsuccessful in dealing
with drama or prose fiction) and to deplore their
absence from those it did not. On the basis of these
value judgments, a complete and highly distinctive history of English literature was then constructed, the story of the “tradition of wit,” how
this tradition came to be broken in the seventeenth
century, how it persisted intermittently or in
underground forms in apparently unwitty poets
like Wordsworth; how it was reborn in T.S. Eliot
and Anglo-American modernism.
The main reason for New Criticism’s puzzling
insistence on treating each poem as a closed
and autonomous object is thus clear. Since the
poem was the vestige of and the surrogate for the
irretrievably lost “old society – the directed and
hierarchical one” (Ransom) – and since it was thus

483
practiced by their opponents, and their arguments
were often confused as a result. A prime example is Wimsatt and Beardsley’s “The intentional
fallacy,” perhaps the most influential of all New
Critical manifestos or fallacy denunciations.
What Wimsatt and Beardsley set out to argue
was the unexceptionable case that the success of
a poem should not be judged solely in terms of
its author’s intentions. But their rambling and
defensive polemic rapidly slid, once again, into
assertions of the superiority of “internal” to
“external” analysis, a peculiar dismissal of “background” information about Donne’s knowledge
of astronomy as irrelevant to the interpretation
of his poetry, and generalized ridiculing of “the
historical approach.” The effect of the piece was
that generations of students were taught that
externally derived information about an author’s
intentions (and by extension all other forms of
“extrinsic” information about a text’s historical
context) was somehow inadmissible evidence,
not only a distraction from but also an actual threat
to the internally ordered meaning system that was
the poem itself.
In retrospect it is now clear that, on this central issue of how to use external evidence in
interpretation, New Criticism simply became
muddled by its own partisan and overpolarized
terminology. Cleanth Brooks, also out to extirpate
intentionalist heretics, wrote, for example, “even
where we know a great deal about the author’s
personality and ideas, we rarely know as much
as the poem itself can tell us about itself.” This
is to face the interpreter with an unnecessary
either/or choice between biography and criticism,
but the main objection to it lies in the naivety of
Brooks’s concept of “the poem itself.” That was
the keystone of the whole New Critical enterprise
and unhappily it was a non-existent object.
However unintended their anti-historical bias
was, however understandable in the heat of the
moment and in the midst of the institutional
polemics of the 1940s, the result was that the New
Critics simply did not much interest themselves
in either historical issues or the general problems of historical interpretation, and this had a
damaging long-term effect on criticism which is
only now, in a more recent “turn to history,”
beginning to be overcome.
What had started off as a liberating new
emphasis on close rigorous reading, a welcome

New Criticism

simultaneously the pattern for an ideal form of
knowledge, an anti-scientific knowledge which
“treats an order of existence, a grade of objectivity,
which cannot be treated in scientific discourse”
(Ransom), it had to be inviolable. Anything like
the current postmodernist picture of texts (as in
the deliberately anti-New Critical version known
as New Historicism) as unstable force fields,
fractured and breached by all the shockwaves
of history, would destroy the whole enterprise.
The New Critics needed an ideal text like Keats’s
Grecian Urn (an image they frequently invoked),
a still unravish’d bride of quietness.
Yet New Criticism’s one-sided fixation on the
virtues of “intrinsic” reading and the illegitimacy
of various extrinsic “heresies” (as they insisted on
calling them) nevertheless still seems excessive.
Why should critics with so strong a sense of the
pressure of history repeatedly have dismissed
historical readings as “extrinsic?” The answer is
to be found in the second, postagrarian phase of
the movement’s own history, the war of the critics
against the scholars. The traditional literary historians counterattacked very strongly; indeed the
upstarts who, according to the Modern Language
Association’s 1948 presidential address, did
nothing but fetishize complexity and ambiguity,
were undermining 2,500 years of the humanist
tradition. “History” therefore became the enemy,
the epitome (along with Marxist criticism, the
New Critics’ other main bête noire) of reductive
“extrinsic” readings. Understandably, since they
themselves were often caricatured, the New Critics
used caricature as their chief weapon against the
scholar foe. “Almost every English professor is
diligently devoting himself to discovering ‘what
porridge had John Keats,’ ” according to Cleanth
Brooks. “This is our typical research: the backgrounds of English literature. And we hopefully
fill our survey textbooks with biographical notes.”
If this were true, resistance was clearly needed,
but this is a trivial notion of what the historical
approach might be, and too much energy was
expended in knocking the stuffing out of straw
men instead of looking for better ways of marrying historical research and close reading. Even
the best of the New Critics, let alone the many
simplistic imitators of their “intrinsic” method,
did not seem able to make a distinction between
the historical approach per se and the particular
reductive notions of history as “background”

New Historicism

corrective to both vaguely impressionistic criticism
and the more stultified and pedantic forms of
historical scholarship, itself became narrow and
stultified. It polemicized itself into an impossible
corner, both philosophically (for no text is an
island) and pedagogically (for students often do
want to know about history), and expired there.

`New Historicism 
A form of textual analysis
which developed in the United States during the
1980s and has now become firmly established
in many English literature departments there
and in journals such as Representations, New
Literary History, English Literary History, and
English Literary Renaissance. It cannot, however,
be described as a unified approach or position,
more a cluster of concerns which have been
developed and elaborated in diverse ways –
indeed the reluctance to adopt an overarching
narrative of its own methodology has become
one of its features. Like Cultural materialism
(which is often described as its “British” counterpart) New Historicism sees itself as a radical
approach, growing out of critical engagement
with both Marxism and Poststructuralism.
Like cultural materialism too, it has been particularly elaborated in work on the Renaissance,
especially that of Stephen Greenblatt, Jonathan

Goldberg, Jean E. Howard, Karen Newman, and
Louis Montrose, although it has also permeated
work in other periods: Catherine Gallagher, Nancy
Armstrong, and D.A. Miller’s work are examples
of New Historicist analysis of nineteenth-century
Culture. However, the claims of the newness of
this “turn to history” (which seems strange to
British readers) needs to be situated itself within
the context of American academic institutions and
traditions.
New Historicism was first clearly defined as a
critical tendency by Stephen Greenblatt in 1982
in his introduction to the collection of essays
The Forms of Power and The Power of Forms in
the English Renaissance. Here he contrasted the
approaches expanded in these essays with the
hitherto dominant procedures in American
critical practice: “traditional literary history” and
New Criticism. The former approach, Greenblatt
maintained, exemplified in the writing of J. Dover
Wilson, sought to impose an artificial unity on
Renaissance Texts, making them internally
coherent and reflective of an equally organic
world view, both of which tended to legitimize
dominant modes of power. The latter focused
exclusively on a dehistoricized text, repressing its
political meanings. The new method, he argued,
emphasized the contradictions within the cultural
formation of each historical moment, indeed
made these contradictions their subject. Following Raymond Williams, this New Historicism
eschewed distinctions between literature and the
cultural and social context within which it was
produced, instead seeing modes of representation
as constituting rather than simply reflecting
social reality. New Historicism aimed to produce a “poetics of culture”; reading Canonical
texts within, and as part of, multiple forms of
Writing, cutting across the distinction between
fiction and nonfiction in exploring the formation
of specific Discourses and institutions.
New Historicism, then, represents a turn to
history, but is often coy about what implied
notion of historical change and social process is
being invoked. Its theoretical reference points are
diverse, and include Raymond Williams, Clifford
Geertz, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser,
Mikhail Bakhtin, and Michel de Certeau. In
some respects it places itself in a skeptical relationship to a historical materialist tradition,
invoking a set of social relations and productive

485
– how to acknowledge one’s own situatedness, yet
make the conceptual leap necessary to apprehend
the radical difference of the past. As modern
readers we continually run the danger of reading
texts anachronistically, seeing them as mirrors
or projections of our own concerns rather than
attempting to excavate the complex meanings
they may have had when they were written.
The emphasis on the “textuality of history”
draws on both Foucault and de Certeau’s writing
in seeing history itself as a set of archaeological
traces and as narratives whose meaning is compounded by the narrative of history writing itself.
To some extent these approaches could be seen
as epochal rather than historical, marginalizing
issues of social change and determination by
concentrating on particular historical moments
as Epistemes – self-contained structures of knowledge which do not necessarily tally with our
own. Another starting point which shares this
“flattening” perspective is Cultural anthropology, particularly the writings of Clifford
Geertz. Geertz’s work on cultures radically different
from his own entailed reading the symbolic
structures of these societies as stories which their
inhabitants tell about themselves. “The culture
of a people is an ensemble of texts,” he wrote,
“themselves ensembles which the anthropologist
strains to read over the shoulders of those to
whom they properly belong” (“Deep play: note
on the Balinese cock fight” in Myth, Symbol
and Culture, 1974, p. 29). Much new historicist
work too wishes to “read over the shoulder” of
moments in the past, aiming at “thick description”
of the processes at work within them by close
reading of specific works.
For all the stress on decentering the text, however, much New Historicist work still privileges
literary over other forms of discourse, though it
might expand its definition. In the first place,
as many of its critics have pointed out, it does
often seem to return to canonical writing and
to extrapolate an entire social dynamic from the
close reading of a specific work or Trope.
Second, literary, and specifically dramatic forms
of playing and performance are seen as key
metaphors for the society as a whole. For example,
Greenblatt’s Shakespearian Negotiations (1988)
reads the Elizabethan stage as a central economic,
political, and psychic institution. Elizabethan
society was organized around theatricality, he

New Historicism

forces within which texts are embedded, while
being critical of the hierarchical division between
a determining base and a determined superstructure. Taking this point further and drawing
on Foucault’s work, New Historicism shares with
poststructuralism a distrust of totalizing social
theories and “grand narratives,” continually problematizing the standpoint from which specific
perceptions and theories are formed, though
often in the process reinforcing the secure institutional base from which such deconstructing
assertions are made.
New Historicism stresses the interdependent
nature of cultural forms and institutions, and
reads all traces of the past as texts, narratives to
be interpreted. In refusing to give precedence to
any particular story, it runs the risk of falling into
complete relativism, in which history becomes an
infinitely repetitive and regressing set of reflections. Stephen Greenblatt’s work in particular is
sensitive to these problems. In Marvellous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World (1991) for
example, he argues that his emphasis on anecdote
rather than totalizing explanatory stories mirrors
the perceptions of the European encounter with
America which he is analyzing. Nevertheless,
he also points out that purely local knowledge
is simply the underside of the totalization of
which he is critical. He acknowledges that in
foregrounding some of these anecdotes as representative stories, as somehow metaphoric, he is
pointing to more generalized structures of power,
though these often remain implied. In doing so,
however, he runs the risk of reproducing the
kind of “world view” that New Historicism claims
to avoid.
Thus new historicist criticism, as Louis
Montrose claims, emphasizes the “historicity of
texts and the textuality of history.” But these two
projects may entail distinct, even contradictory
methodologies and notions of history itself. The
“Historicity of texts” suggests that writings
are produced within specific social, cultural, and
economic conditions, and that at some level they
are determined by those conditions, even as they
contribute to their formation. The “textuality
of history” emphasizes that history itself can be
apprehended only as a collection of representations, open to multiple mediations, renarrations,
and interpretations. However, both approaches
recognize the problem of how to read historically

New Left

486
argued; the notion of performance was central
to both the shaping of individual subjectivity
and the power relationships permeating society
as a whole, manifested by pageant, public ceremony, and display. Renaissance drama does not
simply reflect this theatricality – it produces,
reproduces, and negotiates it in a much more
complicated way, and thus it is impossible to
draw a distinction between aesthetic and other
kinds of social energy and discourse.
This stress on negotiation and renegotiation, in
which dramatic forms actively shape the power
relationships of their society, continually subverting yet also ultimately contained by dominant
forms of state ideological power, has led some
critics of New Historicism to argue that it has
become mesmerized by the notion of “ideological
entrapment,” on which it relies. Alan Sinfield, for
example, argues in Faultlines: Cultural Materialism and the Politics of Dissident Reading (1992) that
the approach does not realize its own political
potential, too easily falling into the relativism
and Formalism of post-structuralist rhetoric,
and failing to consider how dissident reading
strategies might be developed. Some feminists
have also argued that New Historicism runs the
risk of reinforcing the marginality of oppressed
groups, though others have developed its methods to focus on the power play of Gender. It has,
some claim, simply become another professional
approach, quickly engulfed and incorporated by
an insatiable American literary institution.

`New Left 
In general, left, often with an initial
capital, refers to Liberal or radical views in
politics that evolved during the 1950s, 1960s,
and 1970s. Ideologically and globally, according
to Cranston (1971), the New Left may be partly
defined (for there are national differences) in
contrast to the Old Left by their relationship to
Karl Marx. The Old Left made capitalism and
the rights of labor its central concerns, adhered
to party lines, and envisaged the industrial working classes becoming the universal revolutionary
class. In contrast, representatives of the New Left
are independent and individualistic, emphasizing not the economist Marx of Capital (1954), but
the sociologist and humanist of The Economic
and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (1959),
and look to the proletariat of the impoverished
peasants of the Third World, the blacks in the
ghettoes, and alienated bourgeoisie and intellectuals for change.
Nigel Young identifies a “core identity” for
the NL, composed at first (late 1950s and early
1960s) of nonviolent direct action, civil disobedience, anti-militarism, utopian pacifism, and
decentralized participatory democracy to create an
alternative community opposed to the established
injustice and insanity of racism and nuclear war.
These beliefs were expressed, for example, by
the anti-nuclear Committee of 100/Aldermaston
marches and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in England, the Southern US
Montgomery bus boycott (1955) that brought
Martin Luther King, Jr, to prominence, the sit-ins,
and the Mississippi Freedom Summers of the
broadening Civil Rights Moment, the Berkeley Free
Speech Movement of 1964 (and similar activities
at Columbia University, Berlin, Nanterre, the
London School of Economics). The nuclear
peace movement added a transnational element

demonstrations continue. The women’s movement, though it rejected the male-dominated NL,
was a product of it.

`New Left Review 
Journal of the British New
Left, founded in 1960, initially edited by Stuart
Hall, and including among its contributors
E.P. Thompson and Raymond Williams. From
1962 NLR came under the iconoclastic direction of a younger cohort, which reoriented it
towards the traditions of Western Marxism (for
example, Gramsci and Althusser) and then,
after 1968, revolutionary socialism (Leninism
and Trotskyism). Under the editorship of Perry
Anderson, NLR and its publishing imprint,
New Left Books/Verso, exercised a decisive, controversial influence upon the growth of anglophone Marxist culture in the 1960s and 1970s. By
adopting a more ecumenical editorial policy, NLR
has survived the contemporary crisis of socialism
and remains a major international journal of
socialist theory.

(the CND’s positive neutralism, A.J. Muste’s
Third Camp ideas) that linked NL movements
internationally. During the late 1960s the NL
became more violent in tactics and attitude –
in the United States the increasing influence of
Black Power and Progressive Labor at home and
advocacy of anti-imperialist, military liberation
abroad; in Europe the the Red Brigades in Italy,
the Red Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof) in
Germany, the Angry Brigade in Britain, Action
Directe in France. Nonviolent influence waned
under police violence and violent response, the
deaths of Muste, King, and Paul Goodman in the
United States, and other pressures.
The year 1968 was the climax of the NL’s
struggle for a reconstituted world (Caute, 1988).
Rebellions swept the industrial West, composed
of the offspring, especially students, of the more
privileged citizens. Only in America did blacks
provide an element of both the alienated and
exploited. The moral protest against media
manipulation, consumerism, racism, and imperialism found common focus, particularly in
the Vietnam War. In the United States President
Johnson abandoned a run for a second term;
King was murdered; draft evasion was widespread;
the Democratic National Convention was a battleground; Columbia University, San Francisco
State College, and other colleges experienced
insurrection; in Europe, Germany’s most influential student leader was shot and rioting
spread across the country; France was temporarily paralyzed by its worst revolt since 1871;
Czechoslovakia witnessed its brief Prague Spring
of parliamentary liberalization (until the Soviet
invasion and repression in August); student
demonstrations were met with army bullets in
Mexico City; students went on the rampage in
Madrid; massive student protests struck universities in Japan.
Although by the 1970s the Western democracies had returned to business as usual, there were
achievements. In the United States the South
was substantially desegregated, the rule of the
Ku Klux Klan generally broken, the electoral
situation transformed, a war challenged though
not ended. Globally a vision of a world undivided
by rulers and ruled, rich and poor, race, Class,
or Gender, has been sustained, at least on
local levels. Although Third World idealism has

practices, and institutions. By then various forms
of state intervention adopted since the 1930s in
the name of economic growth, social justice,
and political stability had become associated
with persistent inflation, economic stagnation,
and the corrosion of government authority. In this
context a revival of interest in both economic
Liberalism and the conditions for social order
and government authority was translated into
at least the rhetoric – and to some extent the
practice – of British and American government
in the 1980s.
Monetary stability, according to economic liberals such as Milton Friedman, could be achieved
by strict government control of the quantity of
money in circulation, while economic efficiency
and growth could be obtained by disengaging the
state from economic activity – on the assumption
that individuals responding to price signals in
markets provide the best mechanism to achieve
these goals. Interventionist government, in this
view, distorts the price mechanism and spawns
coercion, bureaucracy, uniformity, and the dominance of producers’ interests rather than those
of the consumer. Friedrich von Hayek’s social
epistemology was influential in supporting these
contentions with the argument that only decentralized markets could sift the complex, dispersed
knowledge of human needs which collectivist
politics is condemned to guess. Nevertheless,
agreement about the superiority of markets and
of the need for sound money has not prevented
considerable disagreement among economic liberals over means and policy priorities. In rejecting the moral case for income redistribution,
for example, some have gone so far as to classify
all forms of taxation as illegitimate infringements of individual rights and thus argued for the
privatization of all state responsibilities – even
the military. The minimal state, as preferred by
libertarians such as Robert Nozick, is thus in
some ways close to anarchism.
This points to an even bigger Tension between
the liberal and conservative components of the
New Right. Though their opposition to “big
government” and mutual regard for private
property provide obvious points of overlap, the
conservative preoccupation with order, hierarchy,
and government authority – not to mention the
idea that society can be likened to an organism
with “personality and will” – is at odds with the

liberal contention that a society is nothing more
than the collection of individuals who comprise it.
As Scruton has shown, the value of individual
liberty is, for a conservative, “subject to another
and higher value, the authority of established
government” and this can be menaced as much
“by mercantile enthusiasm,” the language of
individual rights, and the “disease” of democracy as by the socialist quest for social justice
and egalitarianism. The institutions that sustain
economic competition and enterprise are, in
this conservative view, only a component of the
desirable social order, not synonymous with it. This
explains why such people have shown much
more concern than the economic liberals with
the many and diverse threats to social cohesion
which they perceive in social change and reform
– whether these forces are thought to undermine
family, educational standards, national identity,
the established church, public order, monarchy,
or individual morality. Here, then, is a big program for strong, obtrusive government. But again
– as with the economic liberals – a range of
emphases and policy prescriptions can be derived
from this conservative defense of the “organic,”
hierarchic social order including, to take just one
instance, a broadly based battle for the defense
of “national culture” which at one extreme
becomes the overt racism of an Alain de Benoist
in France.

`Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm (1844–1900)
Born in Röcken, Germany, Nietzsche studied
classical philology at the Universities of Bonn
and Leipzig (1864–5). He became professor of
classical philology at the University of Basel,
Switzerland in 1869 at the age of 24, but resigned
from this post ten years later owing to ill health,
having been granted a pension. Nietzsche’s creative life spanned from the publication of The Birth
of Tragedy in 1872 to the production of Twilight
of the Idols and The Antichrist (a vehemently

489
“Dionysian” as a means of decoding the meaning
of Greek tragedy. The Apollinian represents the
formal constraints and structures necessary for
artistic expression: “the form-giving force, which
reached its consummation in Greek culture”
(Kaufmann, 1974, p. 128). The Dionysian, on the
other hand, embodies violent and chaotic forces
of becoming. These forces, Nietzsche argues,
were harnessed and sublimated by the Apollinian
element to make possible the production of the
classical Greek cultural legacy. Wagner’s music is
presented in The Birth of Tragedy as a means for
attaining a rejuvenated contemporary German
national culture akin to that achieved by the
Greeks. By the time he wrote Human, All Too
Human (1878), however, Nietzsche had turned
away from Wagner, seeing him not so much as
a source of hope for the future of culture as
a symptom of contemporary decline. Likewise,
Nietzsche came to view Schopenhauer’s pessimistic philosophy in a more critical light, while
his attitude toward nationalism steadily hardened
(a tendency already hinted at in the first Untimely
Meditation, devoted to attacking the “cultural
philistinism” exemplified by David Strauss’s The
Old and the New Faith).
Nietzsche’s books spanning 1878–82 mark
what some scholars have termed his “positivistic” period (Habermas, 1981). Whether or not
such a term can adequately serve to define the
approaches Nietzsche experimented with in
Human, All Too Human, Daybreak (1881), and The
Gay Science (published in 1882, with Book V
added in 1885), many of the themes and concerns
which are taken up in his later works receive
their preliminary airings in these books – for
example, an increasing epistemological skepticism,
a growing interest in psychology and physiology,
the development of a power theory, the famous
announcement of the “death of God,” and the
recasting of ethical issues in terms of these ideas.
Equally, Human, All Too Human marks a turn to
the aphoristic style of expression which Nietzsche
was to adopt in most of his later works.
The production of Thus Spoke Zarathustra
(parts I and II, 1883; part III, 1884; and part IV
1885) marks the beginning of Nietzsche’s most
productive period. An often rhapsodic text,
Zarathustra takes the form of a philosophically
oriented biblical parody. Most significantly, it announces the need for the “overman” (Übermensch)

Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm

polemical attack on Christian belief ) in late 1888.
In January 1889 Nietzsche suffered a mental
collapse from which he never recovered. He was
cared for by his mother, and subsequently by his
sister, until his death in 1900. The apparent ease
with which it is possible to read Nietzsche’s
books is deceptive. Stylistically, he is one of
the most approachable of philosophers, but the
complexity of his ideas and their development
defies simple exegesis. What follows merely
selects some of the more influential aspects of
his thought and places them in the context of
their effect upon recent philosophy and Critical
theory.
Nietzsche’s writings have had a significant
impact on philosophy, literature, critical theory,
and even theology. Figures as diverse as Sigmund
Freud, Martin Heidegger (who views Nietzsche
primarily in the context of his own critique of western metaphysical thought), Jean-Paul Sartre,
D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, Georg Lukács,
Theodor Adorno, Jacques Derrida, and JeanFrançois Lyotard have all been subject in one
way or another to his influence. In the twentieth
century Nietzsche’s name has had a chequered
history: it has been associated by various critics
of the times with the German militarism of the
1914–18 war and the Nazism of the 1939–45
war – an association primarily caused in the latter
case by the unscrupulous exegetical attitudes
of Nazi “intellectuals,” and by his sister’s own
Nazi sympathies. In the English-speaking world
Nietzsche’s postwar rehabilitation was in large part
due to Walter Kaufmann’s classic study, Nietzsche:
Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (1950; fourth
revised edition 1974) which challenged many
widely held misconceptions about his philosophy.
Nietzsche was initially influenced by the
thought of Schopenhauer, and also by his association with the composer Richard Wagner, and
his early writings (principally The Birth of Tragedy
(1872) and two of the four Untimely Meditations, “Schopenhauer as Educator” and “Richard
Wagner in Bayreuth,” published in 1874 and
1876 respectively) pay homage to these figures.
The Birth of Tragedy is a remarkable text which
attempts to reinterpret the significance of Greek
tragedy by understanding it as a sublimated
expression of the inherent violence of ancient
Greek Culture. Nietzsche’s analysis introduces the aesthetic categories “Apollinian” and

Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm

490
as the supreme goal of human activity. The
overman represents for Nietzsche the highest
expression of human potential, a creative being
able to give meaning to a universe which can
no longer be adequately explained in terms of the
outmoded metaphysical postulates and religious
beliefs of Christian ontology.
In his mature thought Nietzsche developed a
holistic view of the cosmos in which all identities
are the product of relations of force (The Will
to Power, 1968, section 1067). This notion forms
the basis for his contention that life itself can
be comprehended in terms of an interplay of
power relations: “power” as such does not exist,
but “power-relationships between two or more
forces” do (ibid., 631). All living beings are an
expression of this network of contending forces.
All life, Nietzsche holds, seeks to enhance its
own feeling of power, which is none other than
an expression of its “will to power.” The pursuit
of power can have many forms of expression,
ranging from the tyrannical desire to control
others to the ascetic’s will to self-denial and selfdiscipline, which enhances his or her feeling of
power by subjugating the demands of the body.
The emphasis on power in Nietzsche’s thinking
forms the basis for his critique of conventionally accepted moral codes, and forms the core of
On the Genealogy of Morals (1887; 1968). Ethical
systems, according to Nietzsche, can be divided
into two different camps representing contending
interests, “master morality” and “slave morality.”
Master morality evaluates the world from the
perspective of attained domination and power.
In consequence, Nietzsche argues, master morality is primarily affirmative in character since it
emanates from the standpoint of a dominant
social grouping which first affirms itself as “good,”
and only after that conceptualizes those of a
lower rank as “bad.” Slave morality, on the other
hand, is generated from the perspective of the
oppressed. The slave feels him- or herself to be
the helpless victim of a superior force and, unable
to take practical action to rectify the situation,
labels that force “evil.” The slave’s conception
of “good” is a secondary, “reactive” (Deleuze,
1983) consequence of this negative judgment. In
Nietzsche’s terms, Christian culture is a prime
example of slave morality, while ancient Roman
culture exemplifies master morality. Modernity
finds itself caught between the two ethical forms:

“today there is perhaps no more decisive mark of
a ‘higher nature’ . . . than that of being a genuine
battleground of these opposed values” (Nietzsche,
1968, part I, p. 16). Nietzsche’s concern with
modernity, that is, with what he came to see as
the nihilistic heritage of a Christian tradition
which had reached the point of self-destruction,
marks him out in the eyes of many critics as the
progenitor of Postmodernism. According to
Gianni Vattimo, for example, “It could be legitimately argued that philosophical post-modernity
is born with Nietzsche’s work” (Vattimo, 1988,
p. 164).
During the postwar period Nietzsche’s thought
exerted a marked influence upon philosophers
and theorists in a variety of ways. Within the
Frankfurt school, the neo-Marxist tendencies which epitomize the approaches of Max
Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, and Walter Benjamin are frequently tempered by elements of Nietzschean skepticism.
For example, the force of Nietzsche’s critique
of rationalist principles contributes a significant
element to Adorno and Horkheimer’s Dialectic of
Enlightenment (1944), which charts the development of the enlightenment in terms of a struggle
for power which, in its attempt to banish prescientific mythologies, recoils into creating a
new mythological structure of rationalist tenets
to replace them. Adorno’s later development –
especially in Minima Moralia (1951), which uses
the aphoristic style favoured by Nietzsche, and
Against Epistemology (1956) – frequently exhibits
a Nietzschean turn of thought, whereby the
foundational principles of critical reason are
consistently revealed as having an all too human,
and hence questionable, basis.
Among those thinkers within the structuralist and poststructuralist traditions, Nietzsche’s
impact is most obviously evident in the work of
Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Paul De Man,
Jacques Derrida, and Jean-François Lyotard.
Foucault’s attempt at elucidating a “genealogical”
model of history self-consciously draws upon
Nietzsche’s analysis of power and his critique
of the “subject” in a way which seeks to overturn
both liberal and Marxist presuppositions about
knowledge and politics. For Foucault, as for
Nietzsche, knowledge is not composed of an
autonomous body of abstract theorems that exist
independently of prevailing social forces. On the

`nineteen sixty-eight 
1968 was an eventful
year. That twelve-month period witnessed the
Tet Offensive in Vietnam, the Prague spring and
its suppression by Soviet troops, student protests
in Poland, large-scale French revolts in May and
June, the assassinations of Martin Luther King,
Jr and Robert Kennedy, the removal of António
de Oliveira Salazar from power in Portugal, the

contrary, the striving for knowledge is in fact a
striving for mastery over reality; hence “knowledge” is in fact a term which can be thought of
as being synonymous with “power.”
For Gilles Deleuze, Nietzsche is a thinker
worthy of close and careful interpretation (see
Deleuze’s Nietzsche and Philosophy, first published
in 1962) and the source of a number of key terms
in his own philosophical vocabulary. Deleuze sees
Nietzsche as a “nomadic” thinker who spurns the
dualistic institutional and state structures which
dominate modern life in favour of a monistic
and yet polymorphous philosophy of becoming. Perhaps the most interesting example of
Nietzsche’s influence on Deleuze is to be found
in A Thousand Plateaus (Deleuze and Guatarri,
1980), which draws upon Nietzsche’s psychological and physiological accounts of power relations in its formulation of a highly problematic
critique of authoritarian discourse, replete with
an essentialism consisting of “nomadic essences.”
Nietzsche also casts his distinctive shadow
over the deconstructive work of both Paul de
Man and Jacques Derrida. For de Man (1979),
Nietzsche’s texts are Paradigm cases of selfdeconstructing arguments which destabilize their
own structure. Derrida too sees Nietzsche as a
precursor of the deconstructive techniques which
he himself has used to criticize the “logocentric”
tendencies of the Western tradition. However,
Nietzsche is also a much more problematic
figure for Derrida than he is for Deleuze. For
example, Derrida’s analysis of the “left” and
“right” tendencies of Nietzschean Discourse
in The Ear of the Other (1982) demonstrates a
critical concern with the “destinational” structures
of justification supplied by Nietzsche’s own
writings, and their subsequent appropriation
by seemingly opposed positions. Jean-François
Lyotard’s postmodern discourse is marked by a
cross-fertilization of Nietzschean and Kantian
influences in its advocacy of both an agonistic
view of human relations and the role of an
aesthetically oriented Avant-garde (see The
Postmodern Condition, 1979). Lyotard’s position,
however, has been modified by his reading of
philosophers from the analytic tradition (principally Kripke and Wittgen-stein). In The Differend (1983) he constructs a formalistic philosophy
of language in which the term postmodern is
rendered a potentially problematic manifestation

nineteen sixty-eight

and the massacre of student demonstrators in
Mexico City on the eve of the Olympic Games,
where Americans Tommie Smith and John
Carlos commemorated their awards ceremony
with black power salutes. There were also major
protests and agitation in Brazil, Egypt, England,
Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Senegal, Serbia, Spain,
Turkey, and West Germany, among other places.
Also in 1968 the Chinese Cultural Revolution
was reaching its climax; the German student
leader Rudi Dutschke survived an assassination
attempt; police killed three African-American
student protesters in Orangeburg, South Carolina,
in Oakland, California, police held a deadly
shootout with Black Panthers, and in Atlantic City,
New Jersey, feminists picketed the Miss America
Pageant. As these examples suggest, many signature events of 1968 were associated with political
radicalism and social unrest. The crowded explosiveness of that year has given rise to the view
that 1968 emblematized “the long sixties”
(c.1956–77) as a whole (Marwick, 1998; Klimke
and Scharloth, 2008). This synecdochic relation
of ’68 to a broader milieu, whereby part of the
sixties stands for the whole, has placed a considerable representational burden on that year: it
denotes a sustained international counterculture;
postcolonial, peace, anti-totalitarian, and revolutionary movements; and student, racial, ethnic,
gender, and sexual radical militancy. The label
“1968” furthermore evokes events that were
indirectly related to radical politics, such as the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the legalization
of abortion in the United Kingdom, Pope Paul VI’s
encyclical Humanae Vitae, and the My Lai massacre by American troops in Vietnam (the news
of which broke the following year). The death of
Marcel Duchamp and the attempted murder of
Andy Warhol by Valerie Solanad were, given
these two artists, aesthetically fitting. Historically
significant events that do not directly relate to
radicalism and unrest (the invention of hypertext,
the decoupling of the American dollar from the
gold standard) are often overlooked. Of course,
for much of the world “1968” does not necessarily
have any distinctive or compelling meaning.
For cultural and critical theory, however, that
year has a considerable legacy. In ways similar
to its synecdochic relationship to the sixties as a
whole, 1968 gathers and allegorizes a variety of
intellectual developments. Decades later it remains

a potent symbol. Especially in the wake of this
annus mirabilis, critical theory, Poststructuralism, and Cultural studies developed in
unprecedented ways, were widely disseminated,
and gradually institutionalized in the West. Building on traditions rooted in the “hermeneutics of
suspicion,” pioneered by Karl Marx, Friedrich
Nietzsche, and Sigmund Freud (Ricoeur, 1965),
theoretical innovations of the late twentieth
century increasingly followed international and
interdisciplinary lines of exchange. Such was
the case with the parallel and eventually crossfertilizing trajectories of the Frankfurt school,
whose earlier contributions to cultural critique
were rediscovered by a new generation, and the
disparate thinkers associated with French theory first grouped under the catch-all label of
Structuralism. The latter were assigned programmatic coherence when influential books by
Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Jacques
Lacan appeared in 1966–7, and their spectacular global circulation was inaugurated at a
1966 conference at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, Maryland (Dosse, 1997a, b; Cusset,
2008). Cultural studies received tremendous
stimulation from the ’68-era New Social Movements, discussed below. In brief, 1968 is often
considered a birthdate, shorthand, or tag line
for the startling fecundity of critical intellectual
life since the 1960s. Familiar concepts in the
constellation of post-1968 theory include language, power, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality,
desire, decentered subjectivity, resistance, particularity, alterity, difference, anti-humanism, the
critique of representation, and eventfulness.
The flourishing of post-1968 theory was related
to the fate of the New Left, for which 1968 was
the figurative apogee. The gradual disintegration
and dispersion of sixties-era radical politics in the
1970s, notably through a decisive reconsideration of Marxist philosophies of history, was a
crucial impetus for new forms of cultural and
critical theory. Growing out of the anti-nuclear,
anti-colonial, and American Civil Rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s, the New Left had
embodied a shifting coalition of radicals criticizing forms of alienation and engaging social
actors previously neglected by Old Left politics
centered on economic class. The demographically significant postwar baby boom generation,
especially its educated middle classes in North

493
New Left, for which the French Marxist Louis
Althusser’s earlier concept of “theoretical
practice” could serve as a slogan (Althusser,
1965, pp. 167ff ). The university had been one of
the most crucial centers of New Left agitation, and
it was fitting that post-1968 cultural and critical
theory took root and blossomed in the academy.
Cultural studies, in its literary/semiotic and
multicultural/gender expressions, owed much to
this transfer of social movements to burgeoning
fields of critical scholarship. In the United States,
the first African-American, Chicano, and women’s
studies programs were established between 1968
and 1970. But theoretical elaboration could also
be interpreted as a defensive move, a displacement of the energies, projects, and possibilities of
embodied, mass politics to more rarefied interpretive contestation. Thus, a degree of mourning
or nostalgia could be seen to weigh on some
post-1968 cultural and critical theory.
In some countries the post-1968 disaggregation
of the New Left was catalyzed by violence. In
the United States, police violence marred 1968
protests at Columbia University and then the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In
1969 the Weathermen faction took over Students for a Democratic Society, and in 1970 the
National Guard shot to death four students at Kent
State University in Ohio. These events marked
the beginning of an overall decline in American
student radicalism, even though opposition to the
Vietnam War increased in the short term. The year
1970 also saw the formation of the clandestine
Red Army Faction in West Germany and the
Red Brigades in Italy. Although radical politics
in both countries amounted to more than these
groups’ embrace of bombings, assassinations, and
kidnappings in the name of revolution (worker
strikes in Italy in the name of autonomism
(operaismo) increased), extremist violence and
state violence fed on one another, escalated,
and intensified. Indirectly, an overall climate of
violence contributed to an intellectualization of
radical politics. If paying new attention to forms
of embodiment related, for instance, to sexuality,
gender, and performativity, post-1968 cultural
and critical theory often did not attend to other
dilemmas of praxis, such as violent direct action.
Such intellectualism was apparent in the United
Kingdom, where the New Left, already thriving
since the early 1960s, entered a new phase of

nineteen sixty-eight

America and Western Europe, served as a seedbed
for New Left politics.
Intellectual resources for youth radicalization
included the “young” Hegelian-inflected Marx
and older Western Marxists such as Jean-Paul
Sartre, Psychoanalysis, historians such as
E.P. Thompson, sociologists such as C. Wright
Mills, and publications such as New Left
Review, Dissent, and Les Temps modernes. In the
years before and after 1968, Herbert Marcuse
and Wilhelm Reich were especially influential
for their blend of psychosexual and sociohistorical analyses, bringing together countercultural
revolt and political radicalism in the various
expressions of the sexual revolution. The radical
politics of the New Left often expressed themselves,
however imperfectly, along direct democratic
lines and in substantial international opposition
to the Vietnam War, in Third Worldism and
the lionization of revolutionaries such as Mao
Zedong, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh,
and black nationalists in the United States. The
internationalism of “the Movement” was both
real and imagined: some Western young radicals
communicated across national borders and
sometimes with Third World revolutionaries,
but there was also considerable fantasy about
the presumed coherence of uncoordinated circumstances. For leaders throughout the world,
however, youth militancy posed analogous problems that surpassed rigid Cold War geopolitics
(Suri, 2003).
Though the fate of the New Left after 1968
varied from place to place, one can point to an
overall process of creative destruction whereby
“the Movement” splintered into diverse camps
and paths inassimilable to synthetic historical
visions. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, for
instance, political radicalism and the counterculture increasingly parted company, and a
profusion of New Social Movements formed
around specific identities and themes: gender,
sexuality, age, ethnicity, immigration, the environment, anti-psychiatry, and able-bodiedness
(Touraine, 1978). To some extent, this productive disintegration was a natural consequence of
the democratic ethos of the New Left itself, for
which diversity, autonomy, and self-management
were principal values. For some, this process
involved continuing by new, often intellectually
intensive means the liberational ambitions of the

nineteen sixty-eight

494
theoretical effervescence in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, sometimes with misgivings about
student activism (Chun, 1993, pp. 94ff).
To be sure, many of the elements associated with
1968 in the United States, West Germany, Italy,
and the United Kingdom were already firmly in
place before that year, with significant protests in
1967 especially. In France agitation before 1968
was relatively minor, and there were few anticipatory signs of the explosive events of May and
June of that year. Even against the backdrop
of the worldwide upheaval of ’68, those events
were noteworthy. Nowhere else did matters go
so far, and perhaps in no other country did 1968
carry as much import for late twentieth-century
cultural and critical theory. Most influential
French thinkers associated with poststructuralism
and postmodernism were profoundly affected by
“the events” (les événements), which continued
to reverberate strongly in France for at least a
decade afterwards and, via the export of French
thought, for much longer throughout the rest of
the world. If in other parts of the West 1968
marked the apogee of the New Left, May 1968 was
considered “the beginning of a long struggle,” a
moment of possibility that led to a marked rise
in social activism into the mid-1970s.
The immediate precipitating circumstances of
the May events involved protests at the Nanterre
campus of the University of Paris, where the
March 22 Movement had formed in the spring
of 1968 to support students arrested protesting the
Vietnam War. When demonstrations, including
violent confrontations with right-wing students,
escalated, the campus was closed on Thursday May
2 and leaders of the March 22 Movement were
ordered to appear at a disciplinary hearing the
following Monday. The next day, however, in
response to a student protest held in solidarity at
the Sorbonne in Paris, the rector overreacted,
closed the university, and called in the police. As
vans filled with newly arrested students began
to pull away, other students blocked them and
began throwing paving stones. The violence
spread throughout the student Latin Quarter and
into the night, leading to the arrest of some
600 students. Over the next week, disturbances
spread to high schools and other universities,
and the largest national student union and the
junior faculty union went on strike, demanding
the release of arrested students, the reopening

of the university, and the withdrawal of police
from the student district. The rejection of these
demands led to the Night of the Barricades (May
10–11), during which the ferocity of the police
garnered public sympathy for the students. When
Prime Minister Georges Pompidou returned
from an overseas trip, he reversed the government position and conceded to several demands.
The emboldened students then called for a
one-day general strike on Monday May 13. That
day, a march of 800,000 wound its way through
Paris, and that night the students occupied
the Sorbonne, initiating the famous commune,
known by its graffiti and poster art, that would
remain in place for the next month. After the
general strike, workers increasingly threw their lot
in with the students, and ten days later some six
to seven million workers were on strike or had
occupied their factories. In late May the largest
general strike in Europe during the twentieth
century took hold of the country. Events reached
a crescendo as the student and labor movements
pushed the government into political crisis; on
Wednesday May 29, President Charles de Gaulle
mysteriously left the country for a French military base in Germany, creating an apparent power
vacuum. Half a million people took to the streets
to cheer a post-Gaullist transition. However, de
Gaulle returned the next day and in a dramatic
radio address refused to back down, denounced
the entire movement as a communist plot, dissolved the legislature, and called for new elections.
The moment was a turning point: within a few
days, the strikes began to break and the government reclaimed strategic positions; the Sorbonne
was cleared on June 16. National elections at the
end of June gave the Right more power than it
had had before the May events.
The French events of 1968 were distinctive for
their amplitude, their having opened a period
of heightened radicalism in France, and their
worldwide reverberations. They served a role for
some critical thinkers in the late twentieth century analogous to that played by the 1871 Paris
Commune for anarchists and some socialists
before the First World War: a memorable
occasion of unrealized possibility. Many of the
themes of French theory, such as difference, particularity, desire, resistance, decentered subjectivity,
and the problematization and politicization of
representation, have ever since been associated with

large. Transfiguring debate over Marxism was
facilitated in France by the arrival of exiled Eastern
bloc dissidents and by squabbles between the
Communist and Socialist Parties, and in the
United Kingdom by the growing emphasis on
culture and media (for example, Stuart Hall), and
after 1979 by Thatcherism. The self-corrective
movement of Eurocommunism failed in its
ambition to convincingly adapt Communism to
post-1968 realities.
Not surprisingly 1968 has been subjected to
endless interpretation over the past forty years. To
take the French case as an example once again,
the May events have been variously treated as a
non-event that led to no consequential changes
(Seidman, 2004), a failed revolution whose
defeat inspired the theoretical innovations of the
1970s (Starr, 1995), and a genuine revolution
later betrayed by some of its former protagonists
(Ross, 2002). More generally, since the 1970s,
1968 has been charged with ironically facilitating developments opposite to the aspirations
of many young radicals at the time: less the
destruction and overcoming of capitalism than
the expansion and more efficient integration of
market systems (Debray, 1978; Boltanski and
Chiapello, 2006). Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that in the wake of 1968 new fields
of critical thought, notably second and third
wave feminism and postcolonial studies, have
emerged, and existing academic disciplines have
experienced fundamental realignments (Lemert,
1981; Hays, 1998). The fortieth anniversary of 1968
witnessed polemics over its enduring legacy,
especially in the 2007–8 French and American
presidential elections, but also greater attention
to its global dimensions and a relativizing critique
of the persistent tendency to treat it as a sui
generis year.

May 1968. Such association is both warranted and
not. For instance, Lacan was deeply suspicious
about 1968, and some interpreters have gone
too far in assigning French theoreticians (for
instance, Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, and Pierre
Bourdieu) a causal role in the events they never
had (Ferry and Renault, 1990). Student leaders
such as Daniel Cohn-Bendit noted at the time that
the only thinker who had exercised real influence
on the March 22 Movement had been the aging
Sartre (Bourges, 1968, p. 78). On the other hand,
to take one thematic example, the category of
event itself received substantial attention among
French thinkers in 1968 (Roland Barthes, Michel
de Certeau, Henri Lefebvre, Claude Lefort),
efforts followed by Foucault, Gilles Deleuze,
and Jean-François Lyotard throughout their
post-1968 careers, and then by Alain Badiou in
the 1980s (Lefort, 1968; Lefebvre, 1969; Lyotard,
1971; Foucault, 1977; Barthes, 1986; Deleuze,
1990; de Certeau, 1997; Badiou, 2006). In the
most general terms, then, it is fair to say that the
direct democratic “spirit of ’68” did work its
way into many influential theoretical projects
in the 1970s, as a continuation of activism by
other means, or as a primal scene that modeled,
condensed, and symbolized the critique of late
industrial society, critique involving both refusal
and the assertion of transformative possibility. 1968
has been a standard of reference and a standard
reference for contemporary cultural and critical
theory.
One of the most significant developments of the
1970s involved a pivotal reconsideration of the
Marxist heritage, especially its orienting philosophy of history, a development experienced in
East and West alike. The Soviet repression of the
1968 Prague Spring brought to a close hopes
among non-conformist intellectuals in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union that Communism
could be reformed in the direction of “socialism
with a human face.” Henceforth, dissidence
served as a model for political resistance, leading
to the formation of civil-social movements such
as Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia (1977) and nonCommunist trade unionism such as Solidarity
in Poland (1980). The phenomenon of dissidence appealed to Western intellectuals in part
because it resonated with the shift both towards
specificity, marginality, and oppositional politics,
and towards human rights and liberalism writ

the ludic writing of Derrida and other theorists
has invited a misreading of their work, he has nevertheless strongly emphasized the importance of
truth claims and the search for a philosophical
grounding of ethical and political responsibility
in the discourses of contemporary literary and
critical theory. When he finds an abandonment of
these Enlightenment commitments – as in the
writings of Lyotard, Baudrillard, Fish, and
Rorty, for example – his criticism can be scathing
(see Norris, 1990; 1991; 1992; 1993). The range and
depth of his reading and the power of his critique,
which continues to be inspired by the thought of
William Empson, have earned him a unique credibility that enables him to instruct both literary
theorists on their often shallow knowledge of
philosophy and traditional philosophers on the
superficiality of their dismissals of literary theory.

A focus of intense though
rather short-lived interest among (mainly) deconstructionist literary critics during the early to
mid-1980s. The most influential source text was
Jacques Derrida’s essay “No apocalypse, not now
(seven missiles, seven missives),” first delivered
at a Cornell University conference in 1984 and then
published – along with other contributions – in
a special number of the journal Diacritics. This
debate examined further a number of themes
that were already prominent in the discourse of
Avant-garde literary theory. It coincided with

497

(i)

What authority do its practitioners possess
vis-à-vis those other, more established disciplines or fields of specialized knowledge
(scientific, technological, diplomatic, militarostrategic, etc.), whose competence in such
matters is standardly taken for granted?
(ii) What can this presumptive “competence”
amount to when the stakes are so unthinkably high – and the issues so far beyond
“rational” comprehension – as to offer no
hold for anything that resembles those
familiar (expertly accredited) forms of
knowledge? For is it not the case
(iii) that in this domain there exist no reliable
protocols, no criteria of adequate method
or valid inference, no appeal to patterns of
predictive reasoning, of well-founded conjecture by analogy with past experience,
and so forth, that would serve to determine
the truth or falsehood of any given claim?
For, as Derrida writes, “[a]ll of them [the
putative ‘experts’] are in the position of
inventing, inaugurating, improvising procedures and giving orders where no model
. . . can help them at all” (Derrida, 1984,
p. 22). On which grounds
(iv) might it not be argued that “competence” in
this matter belongs just as much to those

(v)

– literary critics, rhetoricians, deconstructionists, speech-act theorists, and others
– whose concern is precisely with interpretative issues that exceed the parameters
of logical discourse or rational decidability?
“We can therefore consider ourselves
competent,” Derrida suggests, “because
the sophistication of the nuclear strategy
can never do without a sophistry of belief
and the rhetorical simulation of a text”
(p. 26). Whence the further question
as to the status of the so-called nuclear
referent, that to which all these discourses
(supposedly) allude in their various modes
of description, analysis, strategic calculation,
threat and counterthreat, simulated (war
game) scenarios, and so forth. This referent
cannot be equated with the weapons
themselves – with their number, accuracy,
degree of technological advancement, speed,
range, “first-strike” capacity, or whatever
– since these factors only count in so far as
they partake of an escalating rhetoric (that
of nuclear “deterrence”) whose stakes are
defined entirely in performative as opposed
to constative or factual-descriptive terms.

Thus: “If there are wars and a nuclear threat,
it is because ‘deterrence’ has neither ‘original
meaning’ nor measure. Its ‘logic’ is the logic of
deviation and transgression, it is rhetoricalstrategic escalation or nothing at all” (Derrida,
1984, p. 29). Then again, one might construe the
nuclear “referent” as that of global war or the
“unthinkable” happening – the end game catastrophe – toward which all these discourses gesture.
Such debate is presumably conducted either
with the purpose of preventing its occurrence (as
in the case of “classical” deterrence theory), or with
a view to planning the event and securing the
best possible chance of victory and survival for
one side only should war eventually break out.
The latter was the line of argument adopted by
those soidisant new “realists” of the early 1980s
– Weinberger among them – who envisaged the
United States “prevailing” in a limited (tactical)
nuclear exchange. In their view hostilities would
somehow stop short of wholesale destruction by
allowing the belligerents time to pull back and
avoid firing their entire arsenal of intercontinental
ballistic missiles.

nuclear criticism

a tense period in US–Soviet relations when the
right-wing Reagan administration seemed about
to abandon the hitherto prevailing doctrine of
Mutual Assured Destruction, that is, the so-called
“balance of terror” which (according to nuclear
strategists) had so far prevented the outbreak of
global war. Thus Reagan took to speaking casually of the Soviet Union as the “evil empire,”
while hawkish policy makers such as Caspar
Weinberger discussed the prospect of a “limited”
(tactical) nuclear exchange which could somehow
be contained short of an all-out, annihilating
confrontation. In this context it appeared to
many that the choice was between two competing forms of lunacy, the one caught up in
an escalating “logic” of bluff and counterbluff
whose outcome was beyond rational calculation,
while the other – in the name of a “new realism”
– looked set to provoke nuclear catastrophe by
adopting a yet more aggressive rhetorical stance.
Thus Derrida raises the following questions
with regard to “nuclear criticism”:

nuclear criticism

498
Of course (as its critics were quick to point out),
this doctrine introduced a new and dangerous
destabilizing element into a field – that of
US–Soviet nuclear diplomacy – whose precarious
balance depended on the threat of precisely such
an all-out war of mutual annihilation. It was
thus likely to provoke the Soviets into an early use
of their own first-strike capacity, since after all
they would have nothing to lose thereby if the
US strategists were thinking in similar terms. It
also ignored what they (the Soviets) had adopted
as a matter of “realist” policy, that is, the
assumption – hitherto shared with their US
counterparts in the deterrence theory camp –
that a nuclear exchange could not in fact be
confined to the deployment of “limited” (tactical
or battlefield) weapons, but would rapidly and
inevitably escalate to the catastrophic point of no
return. In this case (again) the strategic imperative on both sides would be to launch as many
as possible of one’s own warheads at the first
opportunity and thus save them from preemptive
destruction by the first wave of incoming enemy
missiles.
Such are the Aporias of nuclear discourse,
deterrence doctrine, and its various supposed
alternatives. Their effect – as Derrida sees it – is to
delegitimize any form of knowledge which stakes
its authority on the existence of a given nuclear
“referent,” or on the presupposed capacity of
human reason to figure out ways and means of
coping with the nuclear threat. In this field “there
is a multiplicity of dissociated, heterogeneous
competencies,” such that “any knowledge is
neither coherent nor totalizable” (Derrida, 1984,
p. 22). And again:
The dividing line between doxa and episteme
[i.e. between “mere opinion” and “knowledge”]
begins to blur as soon as there is no longer any
such thing as an absolutely legitimizable competence for a phenonomenon which is no longer
strictly techno-scientific but techno-militaropolitico-diplomatic through and through, and
which brings into play the doxa or incompetence
even in its calculations. (p. 24)

This is the weak or negative justification for
nuclear criticism. Since the self-appointed
“experts” are so manifestly out of their depth in
confronting such a range of intractable problems,

aporias, or wholly unforeseeable turns of event,
therefore (so it is argued) the field is wide
open for others, literary theorists among them,
to discuss these issues with an equal claim to
competence. More specifically, they – and
deconstructionists in particular – may well have
something useful to contribute on this question
of undecidability, or the way in which nuclear
discourse problematizes the relation between
truth and falsehood, fact and fiction, constative
and performative speech-act genres, or reality
and its various orders of textual or rhetorical
simulation.
However, there is a further intriguing suggestion in Derrida’s essay – the “strong” thesis, as it
might be called – which became the main focus
for subsequent debate on the topic of nuclear criticism. This is the claim that Deconstruction has
a special affinity with the discourse on nuclear war
since it belongs to an epoch that has confronted
the prospect of an absolute, remainderless
catastrophe, one that would leave no trace of a
civilization – or a written archive – by which to
assess, represent, or commemorate the strictly
unthinkable event. Derrida broaches this theme
with a series of cryptic allusions to Mallarmé,
Kafka, Beckett, and others, whose Texts may be
read as gesturing toward that silence on the far
side of everything that has comprised our history
and cultural tradition to date. It is a topos that
has also been taken up – for the most part by
literary theorists – with reference to the Kantian
sublime. For here also there is the obscure
intimation of a thinking that would somehow
transcend the limits of everyday phenomenal
cognition, that mode of understanding which (as
Kant describes it) brings sensuous intuitions
under adequate concepts, and thereby affords us
veridical knowledge of the world. This discourse
on the sublime is analogous with nuclear criticism
in so far as they both have to proceed in the
absence of any known or (indeed) any knowable referent; that is to say, in so far as they both
take rise from a moment of anticipatory trauma
which lacks an adequate (commensurable) object
in the domain of past or present experience.
Such is at any rate the best, most intelligible
construction that I am able to place upon these
often obscure and riddling statements with regard
to the nuclear sublime.
Thus, in Derrida’s words:

499

The reference here is to Edmund Husserl and
the project of transcendental Phenomenology,
a topic to which Derrida devoted two early
books and whose formative influence on his own
thinking – however critical his treatment of it –
is everywhere manifest in his later work. Thus
“nuclear criticism” is somehow to be thought
of as a radicalization – a pressing to the limit – of
those issues posed by a deconstructive reading of
the Western “logo-centric” tradition of thought
in which Husserl stands (in Derrida’s view) as the
last and most rigorous exponent. In that case –
the strong thesis again – deconstruction would
inhabit that critical zone where thought comes
up against the absolute limits of truth, knowledge,
reason, logic, or adequate representation. This is
on account of its peculiar expertise (or “competence”) in a range of strictly undecidable issues,
among them “the relations between knowing
and acting, between constative and performative
speech-acts, between the invention that finds
what was already there and the one that produces
new mechanisms or new spaces” (Derrida, 1984,
p. 23).
One could venture various explanations for
the fact that nuclear criticism enjoyed only a
brief period of high visibility in the pages of
Diacritics and other such organs of advanced Cultural and literary theory. One is the lessening
of tension that has occurred with the breakup
of the Soviet empire, the decommissioning of
(at least some) nuclear weapons, and the advent
– supposedly – of a “new world order” in which
there no longer appears to be any imminent
threat of global catastrophe. Nevertheless, these
are scarcely reasons for unqualified optimism, as
Ken Ruthven reminds us in his sombre epilogue
to the only book-length study to date on the
topic of nuclear criticism. After all, there remain
vast stockpiles of warheads and delivery systems,
some of them now unaccounted for and most

likely under the control – such as it is – of forces
in the warring ex-Soviet republics and other violently unstable regions. From this point of view
the situation is perhaps more dangerous (or less
amenable to “expert” forms of strategic thinking,
rational calculation, crisis management, etc.) than
at the time when Derrida delivered his lecture at
Cornell. What has changed is that highly specific
conjuncture – of rhetorical “escalation” to the
point of aporia or absolute “undecidability” – from
which this movement first took rise and in
which it discovered a short-lived pretext for
some fairly arcane and wire-drawn argumentation.
At its best nuclear criticism offered a focus
(albeit, at times, an oddly angled one) for exposing the sheer illogicality of deterrence theory and
alternative strategic doctrines. To this extent it
made common cause with other approaches – for
instance, by philosophers in the broadly analytic
(or Anglo-American) camp – which addressed
similar issues in a different, less apocalyptic
style. (See, for example, Blake and Pole, 1983
and 1984.) Even so, the suspicion still hangs over
many of these texts – Derrida’s included – that
by thus raising the rhetorical stakes they are
indulging a form of runaway doomsday paranoia
which itself partakes of that same pseudo-logic,
that escalating language of crisis and terminal
catastrophe whose effects they purport to analyze.
In this context more than most, it is important
that certain distinctions should not be blurred.
These include the boundaries between fact and
fiction, reason and unreason, or reality and its
various counterfeit guises – wargame scenarios
etc. – where any such confusion is likely to generate real-world crises and catastrophes of the
kind so vividly prefigured in the 1960s film Dr
Strangelove. Which is also to say, pace Derrida, that
theorists should not make light of the distinction
between constative and performative speech-act
genres, whatever their seeming “undecidability”
when encountered in certain (surely aberrant)
forms of nuclear strategic discourse. Nor should
they devise sophistical pretexts for distracting
attention from the nuclear “referent,” whether this
be construed in terms of an all too real nuclear
arsenal or in cognizance of the all too present and
future possibility that those weapons will actually
be used. What is required is a level-headed analysis which underestimates neither the capacities
of critical reason nor the forces ranged against it

nuclear criticism

the historicity of literature is contemporaneous
through and through, or rather structurally
indissociable, from something like a nuclear
epoch (by nuclear “epoch”, I mean also the
BpochB; suspending judgment before the ultimate decision). The nuclear age is not an epoch,
it is the absolute BpochB; it is not absolute
knowledge and the end of history, it is the
BpochB of absolute knowledge. (p. 30)

in the name of “deterrence,” “realism,” “containment,” “first-strike potential,” “damagelimitation,” etc. Otherwise – to adapt Karl
Krauss’s famous remark about psychoanalysis –
there is a risk that nuclear criticism will become
just one more symptom of the selfsame disease
for which it purports to offer a cure.

`Nussbaum, Martha (1947–) 
American philosopher and classicist. Nussbaum’s first book
was a critical edition of, and set of commentaries
on, Aristotle’s De Motu Animalium, at the time
a rather neglected part of his corpus. Nussbaum
then branched out from these Aristotelian origins
to offer reflections on Greek and Hellenistic
thought, Ethics, rhetoric, the nature of human
action, and the connections between philosophy
and literature. In the past fifteen years or so,
roughly beginning with the publication of Poetic
Justice (Nussbaum, 1995), she has published
on a wide variety of issues in ethical, social and
political, and legal theory and practice.
Part of the inspiration for the basic idea of The
Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek
Tragedy and Philosophy (Nussbaum, 1986) comes
from Bernard Williams’s work on “moral
luck.” Nussbaum tests Williams’s skepticism
about the existence of a moral value immune to
luck by working through the embodiment of this
claim in certain ancient Greek texts, as well as
the way these texts construct and consider an
ethics of rational self-sufficiency that would be
immune to luck. Thus readings of parts of
tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides

show an acknowledgment of the role luck plays
in our moral lives, and the perils of the attempt
to make oneself rationally self-sufficient. Plato’s
works, on the other hand – at least parts of the
Protagoras, Phaedo, Republic, and Symposium – are
read as an attempt to escape the realm of luck.
The Platonic philosopher strives to make values
commensurable, thereby attempting to avoid
conflicts of value, and to limit exposure to those
things which might make value vulnerable, such
as the effects of the passions and strong, enduring commitments to others. Parts of Aristotle’s
corpus, finally, offer a complex account of human
being that acknowledges the roles contingency
and the body must play in the lives we actually
lead. Both Aristotle’s method of “saving the
appearances” and his accounts of the relations
between reason and desire, for example, complement tragedy’s insight into the limitations of
human self-sufficiency.
The basic themes of this work are also gathered
together in Love’s Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature (Nussbaum, 1990), which
offers reflections on novels by James, Dickens,
Proust, and others, as well as further thoughts on
Plato and Aristotle. For Nussbaum, the novels in
question deserve philosophical attention in part
because they offer answers to the question “How
should one live?” – answers that are based on four
claims: (1) the incommensurability of values;
(2) the priority of the particular and hence of perception, rather than Kantian or Platonic reason;
(3) the ethical value of emotions; (4) the ethical
value of “uncontrolled happenings” (Nussbaum,
1990, chapter 1, section E). These essentially
Aristotelian answers are communicated in a form
that matches this content perfectly, as the novels
both embody these claims and call for their
reader to respond in terms of them (Nussbaum,
1990, chapter 1, section A).
Not surprisingly, some of Nussbaum’s readings
of the works of tragedians, novelists, and philosophers have been called into question. One
example is her treatment of Plato: his works, when
read as dialogues rather than as proto-treatises,
embody many of the features Nussbaum most
admires in philosophical literature, while challenging some of her most prized substantive philosophical theses. Her tradition-bound readings of
Plato’s texts seem to keep her from confronting
both an embodiment of some of her formal

501
the cases she is trying to make? A very plausible possibility (Terlazzo, forthcoming) is that
Nussbaum’s practical goals outweigh, for her, the
desire to achieve merely theoretical consistency.
This becomes a particularly compelling thought
as one reflects on Nussbaum’s occasional use
of the term “quietism” as a tool for criticizing
others in political contexts: see, for example, her
criticism of Judith Butler (Nussbaum, 1999a).

claims and a challenge to her substantive claims
about incommensurability, particularity, and luck
– and thus perhaps also from confronting a
challenge to her views about the interpenetration
of form and content.
In her more recent work, Nussbaum exhibits
an impassioned commitment to the liberal tradition regarding a broad range of ethical, social
and political, and legal issues: for example, the
importance of literature for understanding law
(Nussbaum, 1995); the priority of cosmopolitanism over patriotism (Nussbaum, 1996) and
the importance of the values of liberal education
for achieving such cosmopolitanism (Nussbaum,
1997); the need for an internationalist, liberalist version of feminism (Nussbaum, 1999b)
centering on human “capabilities” (Nussbaum,
2000); the centrality of emotions to human
understanding (Nussbaum, 2001) and the importance, nonetheless, of offering a critique of
some uses of the emotions of disgust and shame
(Nussbaum, 2004); the ways in which the capabilities approach broadens our notions of the
scope of justice (Nussbaum, 2007); and the crucial roles religious equality plays in America’s
political life.
In some ways the lessons Nussbaum articulates
have a cumulative effect. The importance she
sees in the narrative imagination, for example,
becomes more fully articulated and so deepens
as the story continues. The breadth of the concerns expressed in Nussbaum’s prolific career
can, however, lead one to wonder about issues of
overall coherence. Is her treatment of Socrates,
for example, consistent, or does she present one
face when interpreting his appearances in Plato’s
texts and quite another when using him as the
paradigm of the life of rational argumentation,
for the sake of criticizing others? (Does she
need to be consistent here? If so, why?) Are her
evident political commitments coherent, or do
they sometimes conflict in a way that undermines

Conservative political philosopher. He argued (1962) that
“almost all politics today have become Rationalist or near-Rationalist” in the sense that improvement, even perfection, is promised from
the application of abstract ideas. Claimed that
the conservative disposition – skeptical, averse to
change, and valuing highly “every appearance

government is “merely to rule” on the basis of
contingency and experience, not to impose other

proper role of government is thus that of the

as the crow flies.” Conservatives are unable to agree
whether the Thatcher governments of the 1980s
embodied the Rationalism Oakeshott opposed
or merely worked for the elimination of its past
accretions – a controversy symptomatic of the
confused identity of the New right itself.

`object-relations 
A widely used term in
Psychoanalysis, originally referring to the

Subject’s mode of relating to the world. More
specifically, it designates that branch of postFreudian psychoanalysis which concentrates
upon the early relationship between mother and
child. Heavily influenced by Klein and further
elaborated by authors like Fairbairn (1952) and
Winnicott, object-relations theory represents
a major current in British psychoanalysis. The
concentration on the mother–child relationship
implies a move away from the more patriarchal
theories of Freud.
The term “object” is used by Freud in his
discussion of the psychology of drives (Freud,
1905a). He distinguishes between the drive’s
source, object, and aim (the act toward which
the drive tends), using “object” in the sense
in which one speaks of “the object of one’s
affections.” It is on this basis that Klein constructs her theory of the good and bad object,
the prototype being the breast, alternatively
seen as a source of nourishment and a persecuting object, as the child projects on to the mother
its ambivalent love and hate, themselves the
outcome of the duality between life and death
instincts.

`Oedipus complex
 An essential concept in
Psychoanalysis, which helps to explain the
young child’s incestuous desire for the parent of
the opposite sex and jealousy of the parent of the
same sex. The concept derives from the Greek
myth of Oedipus, who murdered his father
and married his mother. In structural terms, the
Oedipus complex describes the child’s difficult
transition from the dual mother–child relationship to a triangular situation in which the role
and authority of the father can be recognized.
Failure to negotiate that transition is the primary
psychoanalytic explanation for the existence of
psychopathological conditions. Freudians usually date the Oedipus complex to the ages 3 to
5 years; followers of Melanie Klein claim that it
develops much earlier.
In his early correspondence with Fliess, Freud
(1985, p. 272) refers to his own experience of
“being in love with my mother and jealous of
my father” and to his conviction that this is “a
universal event in early childhood.” It is not,
however, until 1910 that he employs the canonical expression “the Oedipus complex” (1910,
p. 171). References to Oedipus Rex, often associated with Hamlet, occur throughout Freud, but
no one Text is devoted to a detailed account of
the Oedipus complex itself.
Initially, the notion of an Oedipus complex
is outlined in terms which directly recall the
original myth; the child perceives his mother as
an object of sexual desire, and his father as the
rival who prevents him fom realizing that desire
(Freud, 1910). It is significant that at this stage
Freud’s “child” is a boy. The full elaboration
of the Oedipus complex and its extension to
include girls requires the incorporation of the
castration complex and the phallic stage into
Freud’s theory. The phallic stage of development
is found in both sexes and is characterized by the
“childhood theory of sexuality” which explains
sexual difference by assuming that all human
beings were originally endowed with a penis and

Oedipus complex

`October 
Inspired by Russian constructivism
and by the belief that economic and social concerns set the context for Art and criticism,
three art critics – Rosalind Krauss, Annette
Michelson, and Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe – founded
October in the spring of 1976. The quarterly
journal, as they presented it in their opening
editorial, was to stand apart from other “overspecialized reviews” such as Artforum and Film
Culture, and to provide a forum for intertextual
critical dialogue. The founding editors identified the need for a journal which could support
an intense examination of structural and social
influences on art. “Art begins and ends with a
recognition of its conventions,” they wrote.
The aim of October is to publish theoretical and
critical essays on visual arts, film, performance,
and music; the editors, according to their manifesto, will publish pieces on literature which bear
a significant relation to these first four categories. All of the articles published in October are
grounded in Materialism or idealism. Since
its origin, October has placed a strong emphasis
on contemporary art practices, and many of
the articles contained in its pages explore the
influence of past artists on current work. As the
title suggests, the founding editors were inspired
by the 1917 revolution in Russia and by the film
October which Sergei Eisenstein was commissioned to produce in 1927. The second issue
of October includes a translation of notes by
Eisenstein on his film Capital. October has also
produced a succession of articles written by
important theorists, beginning with Michel
Foucault, who wrote the lead article, an essay
on Magritte’s “Ceci n’est pas une pipe,” for
October’s first issue.
October has never been without enemies. Its
opponents, especially the neo-conservatives
who comprise the editorial board of The New
Criterion, a right-wing journal founded in 1982,
envisage it as the epitome of a degenerate academic
world and condemn it for its highly intellectual,
exclusive tone. “The entire (dare I say it?) superstructure of ‘scholarship’ erected in these essays
is intended not to further knowledge but to
dazzle the reader,” Roger Kimball wrote in The
New Criterion. The journal, he claims, is “often
opaque and unintellectual.” Such criticism, while
not surprising for a radical publication, contrasts
with the intent of October’s founders, who, in fact,

ontological relativity

that anatomical difference is only the result of castration (Freud, 1908). At this stage, only maleness
exists for the child; femaleness does not exist and
the alternative is between having a male genital
and being castrated (Freud, 1923). The Oedipal
boy typically sees castration as a punishment
inflicted by the jealous father; in the case of the
girl matters are less clear, as she may feel that
she has been deprived of a male genital by her
mother. The Oedipus complex is described as
being gradually “dissolved” for the boy by the
threat of castration. Its dissolution inaugurates
a latency period characterized by a desexualization which will last until the onset of puberty.
For the girl, the dissolution of the Oedipus complex implies the adoption of a feminine attitude
towards her father and the use of a “symbolic
equation” to displace her wish for a penis onto a
desire for a baby (Freud, 1924).

`ontological relativity 
A doctrine associated
chiefly with the American philosopher W.V.O.
Quine, and subject to intensive discussion since
the 1950s. The argument may be summarized
briefly as follows.
(i)

(ii)

There is no single “ontological scheme” –
no ultimate framework for dividing up the
world into objects, processes, events, or
the causal relations between them – that
could claim to correspond uniquely to the
way things stand “in reality.”
On the contrary, there is a vast (perhaps
infinite) number of possible alternative
schemes, each with its own ontological
commitments, its preferred range of constituent objects or physical realia.

(iii) What we take as facts or truths – items of
veridical belief – are always, in principle,
subject to revision under pressure from
conflicting (or “recalcitrant”) evidence.
This argument applies even to our firmest,
most deeply entrenched habits of belief. That is
to say, its scope extends from empirical observations (which in Quine’s view are always to some
extent “theory laden”) to the so-called logical
laws of thought – like the laws of excluded
middle or noncontradiction – which we tend to
regard as fixed and immutable. Here also their
truth is not a matter of strict, a priori validity
but the result of their having worked quite well
so far and their still hanging together with the
rest of what we take as factual, self-evident, or
rational belief.
Hence Quine’s well-known metaphor of the
entirety of our beliefs at any given time as comprising an overall “fabric” or “web,” with empirical truths-of-observation occupying a region
near the periphery, and at the center those (for
us) indubitable truths of logic that appear selfevident to reason. According to him there is no
such absolute distinction to be drawn between
“synthetic” and “analytic” propositions, between
factual and logical truth claims, or other variants
on this binary model proposed by philosophers
from Leibniz through Kant to Frege. It is
always possible that some new development in
the physical sciences – such as relativity theory or
quantum mechanics – may force all manner of
drastic revisions, not only at the periphery but also
at the heart of our existing ontological scheme.
Thus in certain instances it may turn out, contrary to usual expectations, that the most economical (least disruptive) way of maintaining
overall coherence is to make some adjustment
to the logical ground rules rather than strive to
interpret new data in accordance with hitherto
“unassailable” laws such as noncontradiction or
excluded middle. What this means – simply put
– is a kind of pragmatic tradeoff, a redistribution of truth predicates over the total system of
beliefs, so as to maximize consistency and minimize conflicts at every point.
From all of this it follows that there is ultimately no deciding the issue between rival ontological schemes, differing ideas of what should
count as real-world, physically existent objects and

505
technology for determining their physical outcome. (See bibliographical entries for Brown,
1991; Fine, 1986; and Gibbins, 1987, below.) But
they were none the less taken as offering strong
evidence for or against the various conjectures
advanced in the course of that debate. That is, both
parties were agreed upon this much at least: that
what held as a matter of proven necessity in
the speculative (thought experimental) domain
must also hold for any physical situation – any
real-world context or achieved laboratory setup
– wherein that experiment might actually be
carried out. Otherwise there could be no point
in advancing such hypotheses and counterhypotheses with a view to testing their validity
claims under specified (albeit as yet physically
unrealizable) conditions. To this extent quantum theory – on whatever construal – presupposed
both a degree of realist commitment and the
application of certain logical criteria (including the
principle of noncontradiction) in order to
decide what followed from the thought experiment
in question.
This squared well enough with Einstein’s conviction that there were indeed objective truths to
be known, even as regards quantum phenomena,
and hence that any uncertainties had to do with
the limits of present-day knowledge, the inadequacy of existing measurement techniques, or
the incompleteness of the theory itself. Thus
there might turn out to be “hidden variables”
so far unaccounted for – perhaps a wide range of
yet more elementary particles – whose discovery
would resolve these problems and avoid such a
highly unsatisfactory state of affairs. In Bohr’s view,
conversely, quantum phenomena could never in
principle be fully described, let alone explained,
in a language (that of classical physics) which
inevitably imposed its own framework of causal,
logical, and spatiotemporal categories. On the
other hand physicists had no alternative but to
conceive their experiments and formulate the
results in a language comprehensible to themselves
and others. John Honner puts the case as follows
in his fine recent study of Bohr and the philosophical implications of quantum theory.
Unambiguous reports on atomic observations
require the use of ordinary everyday concepts,
drawn from a Newtonian world of space–time
and causality, a world of discrete, identifiable

ontological relativity

the “laws of nature” (or causal relations) that
constitute an adequate descriptive or explanatory framework. Every scheme will have its own
strictly immanent, framework-relative criteria for
deciding where exactly – or where roughly – the
line should be drawn between real and other
(for example, fictive, imaginary, hypothetical,
or mythic) entities. Thus “[p]hysical objects
are conceptually imported into the situation as
convenient intermediaries – not by definition
in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, with
Homer’s gods.” Not that Quine is in the least disposed to give up his trust in the natural sciences
as our best current source of knowledge and
advocate a return to belief in Homer’s gods or
suchlike (to us) improbable fictions. “The myth
of physical objects is epistemologically superior
to most in that it has proved more efficacious than
other myths as a device for working a manageable structure into the flux of experience.” Still
there is no reason, as Quine sees it, to consider
this anything more than just a product of our own
(scientifically informed) world view, our current
idea of what should properly count as an item of
veridical belief. “In point of epistemological
footing the physical objects and the gods differ only
in degree and not in kind.”
Quine’s example of quantum mechanics
has been taken up by others – Hilary Putnam
among them – as a test case for the claim that
discoveries in science may force us to abandon
(or radically revise) the most “elementary” precepts of logical thought. In Putnam’s view the
problems of interpretation encountered in the
microphysical domain are such as to require
the development of a “quantum logic” whose
principles would admit – that is to say, would
not exclude a priori – the various paradoxical
results reached by scientific experiment. These
include the uncertainty principle, complementarity, the wave/particle dualism, the impossibility
of assigning precise (simultaneous) values to a
particle’s location and momentum, and the socalled collapse of the wave packet – that is,
into wave or particle form – at the moment of
attempted measurement. Until recently most
of these findings belonged to the realm of hypothetical thought experiment, conducted – like
Einstein’s famous series of debates with Niels
Bohr – in the absence of equipment or available

ontological relativity

506
objects. Hence we are caught in the position
of having to use terms from one view of nature
to report on a quite contrary vision, in which
sharp subject–object separation and continuity of
observation are no longer tenable. What is
observed as a wave is also observed as a particle,
and the application of mutually exclusive concepts
is justified once the framework of complementarity is substituted for that of continuity and
univocity.

Honner thinks that these paradoxes are best
understood, if not resolved, by interpreting Bohr
as a Transcendental realist in something like
the Kantian sense of these terms. That is, we can
have no direct knowledge of quantum mechanical events, as distinct from our representations
of them as given in the language of “classical”
physics. Such knowledge is strictly impossible, as
Kant argued, since it claims access to a noumenal realm – a realm of things-in-themselves – and
ignores the a priori constitutive role of human
perceptions, concepts, categories, and forms of
representation. However, this is no reason for
adopting an attitude of outright epistemological
skepticism. In Kant’s view – and likewise in
Bohr’s, as Honner interprets it – we can still
offer arguments in the transcendental (“conditions
of possibility”) mode for supposing both that
those conditions apply to all possible forms of
human experience and knowledge, and, moreover,
that they cannot be drastically at variance with
the way things stand in reality. Thus, according
to Honner, “Bohr’s position is not a subjectivist
one, in which it might be claimed that reality does
not exist unless the observer is engaged with it.”
On the contrary, “his entire argument is aimed
at providing a framework for applying our
limited observation-language to real events lying
at the boundary of the univocal application of such
concepts.”
Still it may be argued – as by more critical
commentators, Karl Popper among them – that
Bohr’s interpretation of quantum phenomena
was anti-realist (and indeed subjectivist) in so far
as it placed an unbridgeable gulf between those
“real events” and the “observation language” perforce used to describe them. This “great quantum
muddle” was compounded, Popper thinks, by
a habit of projecting interpretative problems
into the notional object domain. Hence the idea

that any anomalies encountered in the act of
observation or measurement must somehow pertain to the object itself – to the quantal system and
its (supposed) indeterminate properties – rather
than figuring in a statistical or probabilistic
account of how that object might be expected to
behave. Only then will it appear an inescapable
conclusion that quantum phenomena have no
“objective” reality since their showing up in
whatever form – as waves, particles, or (hypothetically) as “wave packets” – is always the result
of some observer intervention which decisively
affects the given outcome. Popper sees this as an
error much akin to that of interpreting demographic statistics – the distribution figures for age,
income, voting behavior, the incidence of certain
work-related illnesses, etc. – as if they pertained
to some particular individual whose attributes
could therefore be assigned only a certain probability value. “Unfortunately,” Popper writes,
many people, including physicists, talk as if
the distribution function (or its mathematical
form) were a property of the elements of the
population under consideration. They do not
discriminate between utterly different categories
or types of things, and rely on the very unsafe
assumption that “my” probability of living in
the South of England is, like “my” age, one of
“my” properties – perhaps one of my physical
properties. (1982)

It is a version of this same category mistake,
according to Popper, which has led theoretical
physicists and philosophers of science to speak
of “a duality of particle and wave” or of “wavicles.” It has also given rise – quite against Bohr’s
intent – to the idea that “objective reality has
evaporated,” and that uncertainty prevails in
the macrophysical as well as the microphysical
domain. This is to mistake the whole point of
Bohr’s argument for the complementarity principle, that is, his argument that, when thinking
about quantum mechanical phenomena, we may
often be required to make use of multiple (sometimes “logically” conflicting) viewpoints, languages, conceptual schemes, ontological frameworks,
etc. Such phenomena cannot be described in the
language of “classical” physics precisely because that
language offers, at least for most practical purposes,
an adequate account of conditions obtaining at

507
point where they best fit in with the currently
prevailing state of consensus belief. These arguments have received an unqualified endorsement
from, among others, neopragmatist thinkers
such as Richard Rorty and Stanley Fish, who
regard them as signaling a welcome end to the
grandiose delusions of mainstream (for example,
Kantian or modern analytical) philosophy. They
have also struck a responsive chord with postmodernists like Lyotard and, more directly, with
skeptical philosophers and historiographers of
science (for example, Thomas Kuhn and Paul
Feyerabend), whose work draws heavily on
Quine’s doctrines of meaning holism and ontological relativity. Nor has it been lost upon
disciples of Michel Foucault how close is the
resemblance between Quine’s metaphor of the total
“web” or “fabric” of belief and Foucault’s idea of
discursive formations as determining the limits
of authorized (veridical or “scientific”) utterance from one such Discourse, Paradigm, or
Episteme to the next. In each case it follows – or
is taken to follow – that there exist no criteria for
comparing, contrasting, or translating between
such paradigms since any attempt to do so
would de facto ignore their strictly incommensurable character. More-over, it would always
end by imposing its own (paradigm-specific)
criteria for what should count as an adequate,
logical, or consistent set of standards for judging
between them.
However, such contentions are open to
criticism on a number of grounds. One, as we have
seen, is the fact that quantum physics – a favored
example of ontological relativity for Quine
and other commentators – neither entails nor
(arguably) offers strong support for that doctrine
in its wholesale form. Popper again puts this
case most forcefully: “the denial that we can
understand quantum theory has had the most
appalling repercussions, both on the teaching
and on the real understanding of the theory.”
It may be that Popper has misinterpreted Bohr
and that Honner is justified in his counterclaim
to the effect that Bohr was both a “moderate
realist” – at least with regard to objects and events
in the macrophysical domain – and a thinker
who deployed transcendental (conditions-ofpossibility) arguments for establishing the truth
of quantum theoretical conjectures. If so, then
Quine is demonstrably wide of the mark when he

ontological relativity

the macrophysical (Newtonian as well as “everyday” or “commonsense”) level.
So there is clearly no warrant for the kinds
of abusive extrapolation, or loosely analogical
thinking, which appeal to quantum physics
(along with chaos theory, Gödel’s incompleteness
theorem, and other such currently fashionable
topoi) as notional support for the idea that
science has moved into a “postmodern” phase
where values such as truth, logic, and reason have
become pretty much obsolete. (See the entry on
Jean-François Lyotard for a fairly representative
example.) However, this is not so much a downright caricature of Bohr’s position as a selective
emphasis on those anti-realist (or ontologicalrelativist) aspects of it which Popper singles out
for criticism. That is to say, Bohr’s argument does
quite explicitly drive a wedge between quantum
physical “reality” and whatever can be known,
observed, or said about it in any language (any
logico-semantic framework or system of representation) available to the natural sciences. And
there is a deep problem here, as noted above,
if one considers the extent to which thought
experiments – even those purporting to exceed
the very limits of “classical” explanation – still
require some recourse (whether overt or tacit) to
those same values of truth, logic, and objective
reality. In other words the thesis of ontological
relativity cannot be propounded, or cannot
advance any arguments in its own support, without at some point calling that thesis into question, or adducing evidence at odds with its own
more extreme formulations.
We can now perhaps return to Quine’s
“Two dogmas” essay with a better understanding of the issues it raises, for that essay has been
influential across a range of disciplines, from
philosophy of Science to epistemology, sociology, cultural criticism, Hermeneutics, and
literary theory. Very often it is espoused as a fait
accompli – scarcely in need of further argument
– that realist ontologies have now been discredited (or relativized to some local and contingent belief system taken as a whole); that there
is no longer any workable distinction between
matters of fact (or empirical evidence) and matters of logical necessity; that all truth claims, the
latter sort included, are in principle subject to
revision; and therefore that logic and epistemology should henceforth be “naturalized” to the

ontological relativity

508
invokes quantum theory as bearing out his case
for an across-the-board doctrine of ontological
relativity which would treat the “myth” of physical objects as ultimately “on a footing” with the
myth of Homer’s gods, centaurs, and suchlike
imaginary referents. This amounts to a manifest
confusion of realms between the micro (subatomic) order of events, where such a doctrine
may, at least conceivably, be justified, and the
macro realm of “physical objects” (like Quine’s
“brick houses on Elm Street”), where its adoption
leads to all manner of palpable absurdities.
This is not just a question of interpretative
dispute about what Bohr may have meant by
certain – often obscure and cryptic – passages in
his writing. Nor is it confined to what philosophers, literary theorists, and others have made
of these analogies with quantum theory at its
present (more developed but still highly speculative) stage of advancement. Rather, it has to do
with with some far-reaching issues about the
nature, capacities, and limits of human understanding, issues that have come very much to the
fore in recent philosophic debate. One influential line of argument against the more extreme
varieties of ontological-relativist doctrine is that
put forward by Donald Davidson in his muchdiscussed essay “On the very idea of a conceptual
scheme.” Davidson sets out to refute the whole
cluster of theories – summarized above – which
assert some version of the argument for radical
meaning variance across and between language
games, paradigms, discourses, interpretative
frameworks, etc. The effect of such theories is
to foster an attitude of deep-laid cognitive or
epistemological skepticism, one that in principle
puts up barriers to the prospect of interlinguistic or transcultural understanding. His response
takes the form (once again) of a transcendental
argument from the conditions of possibility for
language and communicative utterance in general.
That is to say, these conditions are necessarily
presupposed by anyone, including the selfprofessed skeptic, who expects that her or his views
on the subject will at least make sense (if not be
endorsed) according to certain shared criteria.
Davidson’s recommendation, in brief, is that we
stop thinking of “truth” as relative to (or “constructed in”) this or that language, ontology,
conceptual scheme, structure of semantic representations, or whatever. This is to move the

matter backward, according to Davidson. Rather,
it is the notion of truth – or the attitude of
holding true – that must be taken as basic to all
language and therefore provides at least a minimal starting point for figuring out what speakers
mean in otherwise (to us) quite opaque contexts
of utterance. Davidson’s chief target here is the
Quinean idea of “radical translation,” that is, the
famous thought experiment in which an anthropologist attempts to compile a translation manual
for some remote (hitherto “undiscovered”) language and culture. Quine’s point is that, even
with the best-willed “native informant” – and even
where the context seemed wholly unambiguous,
as, for instance, if he or she gestured toward a
rabbit and produced the utterance “gavagai!” – still
the anthropologist could not be sure that
“gavagai = rabbit” as a matter of straightforward
definitional equivalence. They might have been
saying a whole range of other, less directly informative things, such as “nice fluffy creature,”
“good to eat,” “saw one like it yesterday,” or
(Quine’s own exotic instance to emphasize his
point about ontological relativity) “undetached
rabbit-part.” In other words – a point also made
by Wittgenstein – there is no a priori reason to
suppose that the act of ostensive definition (that
is, pointing at an object and uttering its name)
either functions in the same way from one culture to the next or provides any sure criterion for
picking out intended objects of reference.
Davidson’s response to all this is quite simple.
In order to find such possible breakdowns in
communication we have to start out from the basic
assumption that the native informant must at
least hold certain things true. From this it follows
that his or her language must possess the means
of distinguishing valid from invalid modes of
reference, predication, logical inference, evidential warrant, and so forth. That is why syntax,
in Davidson’s laconic phrase, is so much more
“sociable” than semantics. It is a shared feature
of various present-day relativist doctrines –
whether Quinean, Kuhnian, Foucauldian, poststructuralist, or derived from the ethno-liguistic
speculations of a thinker like Benjamin Lee
Whorf – that they all move straight from a
semantics-based conception of language to a
doctrine of full-scale meaning holism which is
taken to exclude (or radically to problematize)
the possibility of translating with any degree of

509
question of what follows from this argument
as stated in the formal or transcendental mode.
Thus Davidson appears to vacillate between the
claim that it does have substantive (nontrivial)
implications and the claim that it offers a generalized theory – an abstract (since universally
applicable) account of truth – which must therefore be neutral as between differing epistemological
viewpoints. (See Postanalytic philosophy for
further discussion of this issue.) However, we are
not obliged to accept either Davidson’s scaleddown version of the argument or the conclusion drawn by neo-pragmatist commentators
like Richard Rorty, that is, that his (Davidson’s)
failure to resolve the issue either way is itself
presumptive evidence that no stronger theory is
viable. For there is still the possibility of combining that argument with other, more developed
or substantive accounts of meaning, reference,
and truth. Among the most promising resources
here are those offered by recent work in philosophy of science and by the causal-realist theory
of naming and necessity advanced by philosophers like Saul Kripke. What they share with
Davidson’s approach is a rejection of the descriptivist idea (dominant in analytical philosophy
since Frege and Russell) that the act of reference
– of picking out an object – is a matter of applying the appropriate criteria as given by some
current conceptual scheme or system of intralinguistic representation. On this account we are
able to perform or interpret such acts only in virtue
of our first having grasped the sense of the referring expression, that is, the various descriptions,
properties, or identifying attributes standardly
imputed to the referent in question. As applied
by Frege and Russell, this doctrine was taken to
be fully compatible with a realist epistemology and
a strong commitment to truth values reached by
the logical analysis of language in its various
(referential and other) uses. However, it left a way
open for more skeptical ideas of the relation
between language and truth – products of the
postanalytic, neopragmatist, or linguistic “turn”
– which rejected that prescriptive order of priority and saw no reason to privilege any one such
(culture-specific) ontological scheme.
So it was that the descriptivist theory gave
rise to a chapter of developments increasingly
at odds with its own original program. Kripke’s
proposal is to halt that drift by treating reference

ontological relativity

assurance between one and another language,
discourse, paradigm, conceptual scheme, or
whatever. But the picture changes quite decisively, so Davidson would urge, when we switch
attention to the “syntax” – to the logical connectives, quantifiers, relative pronouns, predicative functions, devices for cross-reference,
etc. – in the absence of which no language could
communicate adequately. What then becomes
clear is that skeptics or relativists like Quine,
Foucault, Whorf, and company are tacitly relying on those same interlingual resources even as
they seek to conjure up the specter of “radical
translation” as a strictly impossible enterprise.
Thus Whorf, while arguing that Hopi Indian
and English cannot be “calibrated,” still purports
to offer an English translation of sample Hopi
sentences and – what is more – to describe some
of the salient differences between their mental
universe (ontology or world view) and our own.
There is a similar problem with Kuhnian talk about
the radical “incommensurability” of scientific
paradigms. In fact Kuhn manages to explain
quite convincingly – even with respect to “revolutionary” periods of crisis and paradigm change
– how these shifts came about and what effect
they had on the operative meaning of terms
like “mass,” “gravity,” “light,” or “combustion.”
In Quine’s case likewise, it is hard to reconcile his
express doctrines of wholesale meaning variance
and ontological relativity with his forthright commitment to various theses regarding the scope
and limits of knowledge in general. Such, briefly
stated, is Davidson’s argument for rejecting any
form of meaning holism that relativizes “truth”
to some particular language game, paradigm,
ontology, semantic framework, or conceptual
scheme. Thus philosophers are wrong – “get the
matter backward,” once again – if they regard
convention (defined in these various ways) as
the precondition for language, and language in
turn as the precondition for whatever counts as
“true” by the lights of some particular (linguistic, cultural, or Interpretive) Community.
On the contrary, Davidson asserts, truth (or the
attitude of holding true) is a logically primitive
notion, one that is presupposed in every act of
understanding, whether within or between such
communities.
There is much disagreement and uncertainty,
not least in Davidson’s own later writings, on the

ontological relativity

(not sense) as the primary term and thereby
securing a stable – or at any rate logically
accountable – order of relationship between
word and object. In this view the paradigm case
of linguistic meaning is one in which a name (a
“proper name” in Kripke’s technical, nonstandard
usage of that term) becomes firmly attached to
an object or through an act of stipulative reference. Thereafter the sense may undergo various
refinements, for instance when “gold” – originally
identified as a yellow, ductile metal with the
property of dissolving in aqua regia – is subject
to further scientific scrutiny and defined in terms
of (say) its atomic valence or microphysical
structure. Nevertheless, these later specifications
still refer to gold as the primary designatum, that
to which the subsequent “chain” of senses leads
back as its originating source and anchor point.
It is only with reference to that first act of
naming – what Kripke calls the initial “baptism”
– that we are able to pick out the substance in
question and trace the process whereby it
acquired a more complex, detailed, or adequate
range of descriptive criteria.
Here again, as with quantum physics, the
point is often argued through thought experiments
devised, in this case, to establish the priority
of reference over sense and the paradoxes (or
counter-intuitive results) that result from working
on the opposite assumption. Kripke’s examples
are mostly concerned with modal or “possible
worlds” logic, that is, they entail asking what
would be the case if the senses, meanings, or
attributes that we standardly take as attaching
to certain natural kinds or proper names (for
example, “gold,” “water,” “Aristotle,” “Julius
Caesar”) turned out to be false or misapplied.
Thus, for instance, what if there existed another
“possible world” in which gold and water had
different molecular constitutions? And again,
what if it transpired that Aristotle had not been
the pupil of Plato, tutor of Alexander, “last great
philosopher of antiquity,” author of the Poetics,
Posterior Analytics (etc., etc.)? Or that Caesar had
never in fact crossed the Rubicon but decided
to turn back at the last moment? Clearly, Kripke
argues, we should not then be driven to conclude
– on pain of manifest absurdity – that “gold”
was not gold, “water” not water, “Aristotle” not
Aristotle, and “Caesar” not Caesar. Rather, we
should say (in the case of “gold” or “water”) that

these terms still denoted the identical substances
for the necessary reason that “we as part of a community of speakers had a certain connection
between ourselves and a certain kind of thing.”
In the case of Aristotle or Caesar we should likewise want to say that these names still referred to
the same two persons – that is, their real-world
historical bearers – despite our having been
mistaken up to now as regards their descriptive
(or identifying) criteria.
Such is Kripke’s idea of proper names or
natural kind terms as “rigid designators,” that is,
expressions whose referent is fixed across all
“possible worlds.” Only thus, he argues, can we
avoid those patent absurdities – like holding that
Shakespeare was not in fact Shakespeare if he
should turn out eventually not to have written the
plays – which result from a purely descriptivist
theory of sense and reference. No matter what
the details of their subsequent career or life
history, these persons – Aristotle, Caesar, and
Shakespeare – are picked out uniquely as the
once-living individuals who bore those names
and whose identity was fixed (so Kripke maintains)
at the moment of conception. The argument
also has far-reaching implications for issues in epistemology, ontology, and philosophy of science.
It has led to a widespread revival of interest in the
topic of natural kinds, one which figured centrally
in discussion of these matters from Aristotle
down, but which fell into disrepute – for reasons
we have seen – with the advent of the modern
(analytical-descriptivist) approach. Connected
with this is Kripke’s argument for the existence
of a posteriori necessary truths. Such truths are
on the one hand a result of empirical inquiry, of
attaining knowledge from scientific experiment
or from the acquisition of better, more advanced
or adequate observational techniques. They are
also – once arrived at – necessarily a part of our
informed knowledge of the world. Thus they
are neither analytic (self-evident to reason and
hence incapable of conveying any newly discovered truths about the world) nor a priori in
the purebred rationalist sense of being somehow
presupposed in each and every act of human
understanding. Nor again can they be classified
– after Kant – as belonging to the order of synthetic a priori judgments, those whose necessity
is both a matter of empirical warrant and of
some grounding intuition in the very nature of

511
increased specialization of expert domains while
permitting nonexperts (an informed lay community) to claim at least a tolerable working grasp
of the issues concerned. (See the entry on Jürgen
Habermas for a different but compatible line
of approach to these questions.) At any rate it
seems fair to conclude, on the strength of both
Davidson’s and Kripke’s arguments, that the
case for full-scale ontological relativity has not
so much been proven as taken on board, across
a range of present-day disciplines, without
adequate critical scrutiny.

thought and experience. Rather, they are the
kinds of truth that emerge from an investigative
treatment of the way things stand in reality, and
which then take on their necessary character in
virtue of the knowledge thus acquired.
It is this sort of knowledge – so Kripke
maintains – which is passed down through the
“chain” of transmission that leads from the inaugural act of naming to its later refinements and
modifications. In which case “the natural intuition
that the names of ordinary language are rigid
designators can in fact be upheld.” The skeptic (or
descriptivist) may urge on the contrary that
“something’s having intuitive content is very
inconclusive evidence in favour of it.” But then,
Kripke counters, “what more conclusive evidence
can one have about anything, ultimately speaking?” This should not be taken as a face-saving
retreat into some kind of feeble or unargued
“commonsense” Empiricism. Kripke’s position is
one that finds powerful support from current
thinking in philosophy of science, notably the
causal-realist and critical-realist approaches of
Wesley Salmon and Roy Bhaskar. (See reading list
below.) Simply put, it is the argument that we find
out more about the nature and structure of the
physical world from a process of inquiry that
identifies (“fixes”) certain natural kinds for
investigative treatment, and which then goes on
to establish, for instance, their chemical properties, molecular structures, or causal dispositions.
Thus, for instance, it is a matter of necessary truth,
borne out by adequate research, that certain
(nowadays) well-known properties, “being characteristic of gold and not of iron pyrites, show that
the fool’s gold is not in fact gold.”
Of course such knowledge cannot be possessed
by everyone, least of all in those specialized areas
of science where only a few have the needful
expertise to actually know, in a firsthand, authoritative way, what the rest of us are obliged to
take very largely on trust. However, in Kripke’s
account this situation is provided for by the fact
that these items of received knowledge will ultimately point back to their source in a context
of original discovery and thence, through various later refinements, to our present (no doubt
unequally shared) acquaintance with the relevant facts. Putnam has made this point more
explicit by referring to the cognitive and linguistic “division of labor” that allows for the

`orality 
The term “orality” describes a condition
of society in which speaking and listening form
the only or principal channel through which
linguistic communication takes place. By far the
majority of languages in the history of the world,
and most languages in use today, are used primarily
“orally” in this sense. (It has been estimated, for
example, that only about 3 percent of all extant
languages have “literatures,” in even the most
general sense.) Orality is of special interest in
literary and Cultural theory because of the
suggestive contrasts it offers with the practices
and cultural horizons of modern, industrialized,
literate societies.
The differing conditions of orality and
Literacy result from what Jack Goody and Ian
Watt have called two distinct “technologies of the
intellect”: speech and writing (Goody and Watt,
1968). Stylistically, for example, communications in speech and communications in writing
typically have different characteristics. Spoken
texts are likely to display less syntactic embedding,
less use of explicit connectives, greater dependence
on nonverbal contextual clues and more use of
fillers and repetition than written texts. Speech
and writing are also acquired differently. Except
in pathological cases, orality is the result of a universal process of language acquisition in humans
which requires (at least as regards a first language) little or no formal instruction – though it
can be trained towards specialized, conventional
capabilities in oral societies, such as memorization and formulaic narration. Literacy, on the other
hand, is acquired only by the deliberate process
of learning to read and write, usually in formal,
educational situations; and this dependence of
literacy on education has given rise to complex
historical and policy arguments regarding how
much skill in reading and writing someone
needs to have in order to be judged “literate.”
Major cultural consequences have been taken
to follow from the distinction between orality and
literacy. Extrapolating from contrasts between

speech and writing to speculate about the psychodynamics of members of cultures with access to
only spoken traditions, some commentators
have suggested that the orality/literacy distinction should replace earlier cultural “great divide”
distinctions such as those between primitive
and civilized, or prelogical and logical societies.
Goody and Watt, for example, point out that
writing (unlike speech) can be kept stable for
scrutiny on the page, and scanned forwards and
backwards – so facilitating large-scale argument
and discussion, including complex logical derivations such as sequences of syllogisms (hence a
special significance in the emergence of logic in
Greece roughly coincidentally with the earliest use
of a fully phonetic-alphabetic script). However,
whereas literacy facilitates a new degree of
abstraction and objectivity – as well as greater
historical accuracy than oral histories and genealogies, which place less emphasis on historical
record than on current relevance – orality retains
and foregrounds magic or ritualistic properties of
language, as well as maintaining a sense of communal identity. On the basis of these and similar
arguments, Goody and Watt propose that the
oral/literate distinction should mark the boundary between anthropology (which would study
oral societies) and sociology (which would study
literate societies). Literacy is in this framework
assumed to create a new relationship between
the individual and language, and in important
ways to determine modes of thought and social
organization (so displacing a common tendency
in earlier, more evidently ethno-centric anthropology, to attribute cognitive differences to
innate differences between ethnic groups).
Perplexing arguments about the psychologically
and socially determining capacities of literacy,
however, is a divergence between two viewpoints: an “autonomous” and an “ideological” view
of literacy. The “autonomous” view (see Goody
and Watt, 1968) describes literacy as a complex
of skills which do not carry any particular ideological load and which are isolable from political
structures and social formations, actively causing
kinds of social change. The “ideological” view (see
Street, 1984) suggests that the skills and applications of literacy always exist within a particular
social matrix of goals, ideologies, and distributions
of social roles, such that “literacy” itself is only
ever an instrument of other determining social and

513
literature,’’ given the meaning of “oral” (relating
to that which is spoken) and the etymology of
“literature” in litterae (Latin: “letters”). Moreover, since many constituent elements of literature feature prominently in contemporary cultural
forms in media other than “letters” (for example,
narrative occurs in film and television; lyricism is found in pop song lyrics, etc.), many of
literature’s apparently defining properties can
be seen to exist outside “writing.” Such apparent anomalies undermine literature’s generally
assumed defining connections with “literate”
forms and “literate” cultures.
Issues also arise concerning ideas of authors and
authorship. In oral societies – not only those
which have what are typically considered oral
“literatures,” but also (according to work by
Milman Parry and Albert Lord (see Lord, 1968)
the classical Greek culture of Homer – the notion
of an author does not exist in anything like the
form which gives it its importance in most traditional literary criticism. Rather, “authorship”
exists in such societies, if at all, within conventions of communal improvisation and formulaic
composition; it is only with a transition to a
literate society – especially one possessing the
institutions of print literacy – that the modern
category of an author fully emerges.
Finally, questions surround notions of audiences
or readerships (notice the medium-specific resonances of these two terms). Reading is not
simply a matter of interpretation drawing on a
routine physical and cognitive process, but a
socially formed, and very unevenly distributed,
set of skills and conventions. Limits on the historically constituted readerships for literature –
crucial for any socially based theory of reception
or Reader-response criticism – are set by
social patterns of literacy, which differ massively
between societies and periods; in this way issues
of orality and literacy are central to a culture’s
defining conditions of production and reception.

political forces, never itself an autonomous agent.
Developing – in both theory and practice – a particularly influential version of an “ideological” view
of literacy, the Brazilian educationalist Paolo
Freire rejects any distinction in a given social
situation between communicative means (reading and writing) and the content or material that
is to be read or written, choosing instead to connect reading the word with reading the world in
programs directed toward what he calls “emancipatory literacy” (see Freire, 1972).
As regards twentieth-century industrialized
societies, arguments over orality and literacy take
on an added importance, as a result of massive
extensions in the use of modern communications media. Walter Ong, for example (in Ong,
1982, and elsewhere), has proposed the term
“secondary orality” – by contrast with his “primary orality” – to describe skills needed to
cope with such transition. “Secondary orality” is
a new social condition which involves, in a
changing mix with established literate modes,
specialized understanding of the adapted, “oral”
systems used in radio, telephones, audio recording, TV, and film. The large-scale social consequences of such a transition into “secondary
oral” societies have been widely discussed not
only by Ong but also, earlier, by Marshall
McLuhan (for example, McLuhan, 1964).
From the perspective of literate societies,
literate forms (as well as literate people) are
often assumed to be of higher cultural status and
special importance is often attached to a Canon
of religious, legal, and/or constitutional documents. This social prestige contrasts interestingly
with privileges which, Jacques Derrida points out
(Derrida, 1976) are attributed in philosophically problematic ways to speech, creating what
he calls “phonocentrism”: a condition of speech
which allows it to appear somehow closer to
thought and to immediate self-presence; or,
since writing is a largely secondary system
modeled on speech, to be considered the proper
subject of modern linguistic investigation.
For modern Critical and cultural theory,
a cluster of important issues emerge from the
discussion of orality and literacy. Interesting
questions can be posed, for instance, about the
medium in which literary Texts exist. While
literature is usually taken to mean books, this
notion is problematized by the concept of “oral

`ordinary language philosophy 
A philosophical inquiry and method originating in the
twentieth century and continuing today. It proceeds from an examination of our use of ordinary
language, examining what we say when, and why
we can say what we do and what we mean by it.
It investigates our shared, representative, and
exemplary ways of talking and acting – the rulegoverned order of our common existence.
Ordinary language philosophy does not defend
ordinary or common beliefs. Instead, it reflects
on and examines the conditions of possibility of
our talk and action and the intimacy of word and
world found in our ways of meaningfully speaking and acting. It reminds us of the agreement and
concordance of language use that exists before
expressions are true or false, certain or doubtful,
knowable or unknowable. It pursues a logical,
rigorous appraisal of our vocabulary by asking
about the conditions that make possible and the
implications that follow from the things we say
and do. It describes the grammar and the agreements and differences and interruptions of our uses
of language.
The locution “ordinary language,” while properly descriptive, has proved to be somewhat
misleading, since it has suggested to many that
answers to fundamental philosophical questions
are to be treated as being routinely obtainable
and easily known; whereas, in fact, the answers
to our philosophical concerns are for the ordinary
language philosophers barely imaginable, since
the subtle variations in the details and data of our
speech, the depth and pervasiveness of agreement and systematic order of our lives, of our
language uses, wherein these answers can begin
to be found, constantly escape us. Numerous
philosophers give little thought or credibility to
ordinary language philosophy since they are mistakenly disposed to take the ordinary to mean
the obvious, the conventional, the trivial, an

unreflective common sense; something that
allows easy appeals to truth and overly simple
solutions to our problems. Ordinary language
philosophers, on the other hand, take the ordinary to mean the exemplary, the representative,
the common order, the public, and the shared.
Rather than solutions to problems being simple
and immediate, an appeal to the ordinary is an
appeal to the complexity, diversity, and multiplicity
of our shared linguistic existence. So where many
take the ordinary to mean unreflective, conventional, everyday intelligence, ordinary language
philosophers mean by it the rule-governed, necessary order of our common existence. The discord of understanding is between “conventional
common sense” and “necessary common existence.” Such confusion has made and continues
to make ordinary language philosophy one of the
most misunderstood of philosophical endeavors.
History Ordinary language philosophy is primarily expressed in the writings of Wittgenstein, Austin, and Cavell. It is probably best
seen as beginning with Wittgenstein’s work in the
early 1930s (Blue Book, lectures 1933–4), although
some unhelpfully identify it with the writings of
G.E. Moore in the 1920s and this contributes
to the misunderstanding of the meaning of
“ordinary.” Wittgenstein continued the work in
the 1940s with the Philosophical Investigations,
posthumously published in 1953. Austin developed
the thinking in his own directions with numerous essays and lectures in the 1940s and 1950s;
especially important was “Other minds” (1946)
and “A plea for excuses” (1956). Cavell commenced his work in ordinary language philosophy in 1957 with the essay “Must we mean what
we say?” and most notably synthesized and
developed much of the area of study with The
Claim of Reason (1979). He continues writing
into the new century with many texts, including
Cities of Words (2004).
While ordinary language philosophy is contemporary work, it is tied to a subject of old,
traditional interest. It is a philosophy concerned
with our everyday uses of language and this
topic has been a part of the discussion throughout the history of philosophy. But it is a topic
of interest mainly as something to be avoided
rather than systematically pursued. Ordinary
language figures largely in traditional work as

517
language philosophy finds itself governed by the
typical, unexceptional, hence representative and
exemplary, aspects of our lives, i.e. the ordinary.
While ordinary language philosophy resists
traditional and contemporary efforts to flee from
the ordinary it nonetheless inherits its belief about
the importance of language investigation from
several sources, with the most dominant and
proximate being that of analytical philosophy.
They both proceed on the understanding that
there can be no account of what thought is or
what world is independently of the means of
expression for each. To understand the world
or our activities of mind requires understanding
what it is for words and sentences to have meanings. This acceptance of an interconnectedness
of world, thought, and language is a common
aspect of ordinary language and analytical philosophy. This kinship is, however, greatly strained,
if not broken, in the fundamental way each
believes we must investigate this interconnectedness. Analytic philosophy insists that we analyze
the ordinary language that surrounds us and
ultimately reveal the logical forms and foundations
for what we say and what we do. Ordinary language philosophy, in contrast, finds descriptions
of our ordinary ways of talking and acting to
provide the material needed for our interests
of philosophical and intellectual investigation.
If our goal is a complete clarity of understanding
of the grounds or conditions of thinking and
speaking, then it is ordinary and not just specialized, analyzed language that must occupy our
attention, since the former provides the conditions
of possibility for the latter. For the ordinary
language philosopher, our common and inherited
language embodies all possibilities of use, all
distinctions humans have found worth drawing,
and all the connections they have found worth
marking, including those discovered by the
analytic philosophers.
It might be tempting to connect ordinary
language philosophy with recent empirical and
descriptive investigations of language. It might
even be proposed that the science of linguistics
satisfies and replaces a large part of the intended
work of ordinary language philosophy. This is,
however, a largely unhelpful or mistaken view.
Empirical studies of language and theoretical
findings in such areas as transformational grammar do not replace ordinary language philosophy’s

ordinary language philosophy

that which is defective and an impediment to productive work. Our ordinary existence and talk are
judged by traditional philosophers as confused,
imprecise, and ambiguous. These are weaknesses
or problems to be overcome. We must clean up
the confusions of our immediate lives and seek
logical precision and ideal understanding and
clarity. We must find the necessities that transcend
the conventional and arbitrary nature of our
everyday existence. Ordinary language complicates
and hides what we seek. It obscures the world and
thought by covering and disguising the logic of
our language; it hides logical and universal forms.
We must get past, push through, go beyond, and
escape the natural confusions of ordinary language
and its many perplexing uses.
This understanding of ordinary life and language
seems uncontestable. The illusory and deceptive
nature of our ordinary existence demands we
seek a philosophical improvement or ideal where
knowing and being are not hidden or confusingly
confronted. What could be more evident? And this
is how it has been largely treated in both Western
and Eastern thought. But it is this avoidance and
fleeing of the ordinary that Wittgenstein rejects.
He embraces the ordinary, its multiplicity and
differences. This is the ingeniousness or the folly
of his work; and of the work of Austin and Cavell
as well. Cavell, in fact, starts his philosophical
efforts with an acknowledgment of this avoidance
of the ordinary and its tension with traditional
philosophy. In his first sentence of “Must we
mean what we say?” he tells us that the suggestion that “what we ordinarily say and mean may
have a direct and deep control over what we can
philosophically say and mean is an idea many
philosophers find oppressive.” Traditional philosophers find ordinary language deeply flawed
and in need of repair or cleaning up. It cannot
properly allow for or ground the difficult intellectual tasks we face. Our philosophical work
requires uncovering and penetrating the realms
of being and knowledge that are not immediately
before us. For the ordinary language philosopher, on the other hand, the ordinary is not to
be avoided since it is the conditions of possibility
for all that is. It is that which sets the immediate
conditions for our reflections, actions, and questions; including those about the hidden and
transcendent. Rather than finding its way in
specialized realms of intellectual thought, ordinary

ordinary language philosophy

518
concerns, but, if anything, confirm in different
ways the working conviction of ordinary language philosophy, i.e. establish an intimacy that
exists between language and world. Discovering
the extent and depth of the systematic in language
use was not and is not a goal of ordinary language philosophy, but one of its instruments of
inquiry; the accordance of world and word is
not an end but a beginning for the ordinary
language philosopher.
Method For the ordinary language philosopher,
the fact of language is a constitutive condition
of word and world, that in terms of which all is
and comes to be. Because of its naturalness and
immediacy, it is something of which often we need
to be reminded, and it needs careful description.
In the midst of the fact of language, we find constraints and entanglements, conditions of possibility and empirical rules of use. One of these
intricacies of life and language that must be faced
is that what we say or express may be meant or
be used in a way we had not expected or wanted.
The context of use in which we place our words
is largely beyond our control. Hence the question
of “Whether we can mean (use) what we say” is
often before us. Not all we say can be meant. The
meaning of our words may be clear, but they
still may not be meant, may not be capable of being
used in this particular context on this particular
occasion.
In order to address our philosophical concerns, the ordinary language philosopher insists
that we must place the words and meanings of
philosophical interest in alignment with their
ordinary controls. We must describe and imagine human beings in particular circumstances
having the experiences and saying and meaning
the words of our philosophical considerations
and problems. This is a common link, not often
made, with Theater, where the context of
things said by particular individuals in particular
circumstances is a significant mark of that discipline’s identity. (See Ordinary language
criticism.) To gain some clarity in our philosophical work, we must reflect on how we
learned the particular words (our words) of concern; reflect on the conditions that make our talk
and action possible and on the data of actual use.
Ordinary language philosophy thereby consists
of two directions of inquiry. It pursues both the

conditions that make language use possible,
and the variety and relations of specific language
used. (See Wittgenstein and Austin for more
detail here.) The first direction of work reminds
us of the almost unimaginable intimacy and
systematic order of our lives, while the second
identifies the interrelated vocabulary and logical
connections of our words. This is a way of saying that ordinary language philosophy reflects
on the fact that our sentences are used, that we
talk and act, and investigates the constraints that
make that fact possible and the implications that
are necessitated by it. So ordinary language philosophy methodically investigates the conceptual
conditions of possibility for the fact that we talk
and act; and presents the empirical diversity and
multiplicity of language uses that are part of
the consequences and specific instances of our talk
and action. The ordinary language philosopher
attempts to place, or find the proper place of,
our reflections and questions of concern in the
ordinary criteria of our everyday language. Using
words meaningfully requires accepting their
objectivity, their factual nature, their shared,
grammatical being. To understand what words
mean we must understand what those who use
them mean, and that sometimes those people do
not understand what they mean, cannot say what
they mean, may not know what they mean. These
two directions of inquiry dominate the work of
ordinary language philosophy, with individual
philosophers concentrating often more on one
aspect than another. Austin is strongly inclined
to the empirical, while Wittgenstein is often
governed by the conceptual, although there is
no denying the importance of each direction of
thought in the work of both.
Such questions of the conceptual facts and
empirical data of our talk and action are not
asked with the intent of undermining or destroying traditional investigations of philosophical
subject-matter. They are so pursued with the
hope of productively reminding us of the place
and context of the inquiry being undertaken, and
with the further hope that any tensions found
between conditions of possibility and claims of
inquiry will be clarified, addressed, and resolved.
When ordinary language philosophy says that
you can’t, traditional philosophy can’t, say suchand-such (“only I know if I am in pain”), what
is meant is that you cannot say this here and

Tenets and Consequences Several basic tenets
direct the collective work done in ordinary
language philosophy. These include the following.
(1) The fact of language is more telling than
any fact uttered within it. Words are before I am.
(2) A silent harmony of humans (words) and the
world stands firm amidst our talk and action.
There is a natural intimacy, a concordance of the
factual and the conceptual, of world and word.
(3) The power and deeply systematic character of
words lay in the fact that they are not mine
alone. The ordinary background of our life of
language is repetition and variation.
These tenets are discovered in various forms
in many different disciplines; and advocates of
the importance of something identified by the
phrases “the everyday” or “the ordinary” or “the
common” can be found relatively often outside
the work and texts of ordinary language philosophy. One of the most valuable of these is
ordinary language criticism. The attention
there to the ordinary and discussion of its spirit
and consequences is most useful, as it provides
a different voice and set of reflections from that
of the discipline-based philosopher. Of course, as
in the field of philosophy itself, the apparent
common interest in the ordinary is not always
as affirmative as this or quite what it claims.
Often the different voices and writings about the
ordinary, while seemingly connected, are not
consistent with ordinary language philosophy,

as the basic tenets and their consequences are
not part of such discussion. Such talk is, at best,
inspired by ordinary language philosophy but
largely inconsistent with what it does and how
it does its work. This might be seen most clearly
in remembering that ordinary language philosophy commits itself, among other things, to a
sense of unity of word and world; a need for complete clarity (rigor); a tolerance of self-reflection
and interruption; a conception of no approach to
the ordinary. This last point is most important,
as many “inspired” or parallel studies find their
very identity in analyzing and uncovering the
ultimate secret and hidden nature of the ordinary
– not unlike what analytical philosophy seeks to
do; whereas ordinary language philosophy insists
there is no approach to it; we are as close as we
can be since it is always with us. Efforts at analyzing and uncovering the nature of the ordinary are
contrary and in opposition to the nature and
identity of ordinary language philosophy.
Such conflicting efforts do, of course, importantly mark ordinary language philosophy and
they represent the latest form of the constant
effort in the history of philosophy and other
intellectual study to reject the ordinary or analyze
it away. It is of fundamental significance to the
ordinary language philosophers to ask why we do
so flee from the ordinary. Apart from the misunderstandings, the basic confusions, and multiplicity of uses of ordinary language, we might
ask: since pursuits of the hidden and the private,
the non-ordinary, result in significant negative
consequences, why would we continue to pursue
such? That is to say, the ordinary language philosophers believe they have shown that hidden
realities and privacy of mind result in our aloneness, alienation, our being removed from others,
our having no common grounds for understanding or for being able to make ourselves known.
Pursuits of the hidden produce all the difficulties
of dualism, narcissism, solipsism, and skepticism.
Exclusiveness brings excludedness. Given these
results, why do we insist on privacy and hold to
it in the face of the consequences of great existential angst and loss of the world? How this is to be
understood is an important part of the work of
ordinary language philosophy.
Privacy solves metaphysical and ethical problems
that are seemingly greater or more troublesome
than those it brings. A fantasy of necessary

ordinary language philosophy

communicate this situation to others, or understand it for yourself. When, for example, someone says “we can meaningfully say or know
nothing about another’s private thoughts,” an
examination of the conditions of saying, their
public and objective status, and their relation
to what is being claimed would seem useful.
Ordinary language philosophy reminds us to
provide a proper context of meaning (use) for the
traditional philosophical investigations that have
engaged us for several thousand years. It wishes
constantly to remind us that we must not be too
quick to reach generalizations, must recognize our
limits, and remind ourselves of our restrictions,
and of the extent of our results or claims. We
must identify our unannounced assumptions
and remind ourselves of what we presuppose or
already know and make clear the consequences
of use of those assumptions.

inexpressiveness (you cannot know how I feel
or what I think) would solve, Cavell tells us, a
simultaneous set of metaphysical problems: it
would relieve me of the responsibility for making myself known to others. It would suggest
that my responsibility for self-knowledge takes care
of itself – as though the fact that others cannot
know my (inner) life means that I cannot fail
to know. It would reassure my fears of being
known; it would reassure my fears of not being
known. Privacy and skepticism allow us, thereby,
to escape the difficulties of moral life and to use
the hidden and doubt as a means of not facing
ourselves or others. (Who are you to question me?
You cannot judge me. You don’t truly know me
or what I am or what I was thinking when I did
what I did.) This is, as Camus will call it in The
Rebel, the alibi of using skepticism and academic
philosophy as a means of escaping the moral. “We
are living in the era of premeditation and the perfect crime. Our criminals are no longer helpless
children who could plead love as their excuse. On
the contrary, they are adults and they have a perfect alibi: philosophy, which can be used for any
purpose – even for transforming murderers into
judges.” The flight from the ordinary, from the
natural agreements of ourselves and others, is
a flight from the moral, from the community
of others. From the metaphysical attunement of
word and world comes the difficulties and constant struggles of a shared, moral existence; which
is, we might say, a very traditional, common,
shared problem: how am I to live with others?
This reminder of the intertwined nature of the
metaphysical and the ethical, of the need to
acknowledge the ordinary and live with others in
terms of our finitude, is a primary consequence
of ordinary language philosophy.

organic unity If a literary work is said to have
organic unity it is pictured as being structured like

a living body, animal or (more usually) vegetable,
rather than, say, like a machine or some other
manmade or inert object.
The image has a long history, beginning
with Plato and then developed fully by Aristotle.
It was given a new lease of life in German
Romanticism, where it played a central role,
and was brought into the English tradition by
Coleridge, paraphrasing Schlegel. It was revived
again by the New Critics in North America,
and by the school of Leavis in England, both
of whom based their praise of organic unity in
literature on an analogy with and a nostalgia for
“the organic community” (an imaginary antebellum South for the Americans, an imaginary Old
England for the Leavisites). By this time, however,
the metaphor was beginning to seem worn out,
partly because of its intrinsic inadequacies – a
poem evidently is not actually much like a plant
– and partly because its political connotations
became more and more apparent and disturbing
in the mid-twentieth century, especially in the
“blood and soil” organicism of the Nazis. The consensus now seems to be that “organic unity” is no
more than a vaguely honorific term, rather than
a useful analytic tool.

`orientalism 
A term for the European invention or idea of the Orient, associated with the
thought of Edward Said. The Orient is not
simply an originating place of European languages and Culture; it is also, in Said’s view,
an indispensable European image of the Other,
which has made it possible for Europe to define
itself. Furthermore, as a construct of European
ideological Discourse, orientalism has made
it possible for the West to dominate, colonize,
and restructure the Orient. Although Said (1978,
p. 3) has often acknowledged the importance of
Foucault’s theories of discourse and epistemological power, orientalism also carries traces of
Derrida’s theory of “European hallucination”
(1967, p. 80). As Western scholars began to

`other, the 
A highly ambiguous term referring, in Lacanian usage, to one pole of a subject–
object dialectic, to alterity in general and, usually
when capitalized, to the symbolic and the
Unconscious. The origins of the concept of the
other are Hegelian, and can be traced specifically to the enormously influential reading of
The Phenomenology of Mind undertaken by by
Alexandre Kojève in the 1930s (Kojève, 1947).
Lacan was a regular attender at the seminar
at which this reading was presented, and while
Kojève’s name does not figure in the Ecrits, his
influence is palpable throughout. Kojève inscribes
the subject–other (master–slave) relationship
within a field of conflict dominated by a mutual
desire for recognition. Man’s desire can thus be
said to be the desire of the other. The formula
is often used by Lacan, but it is far from uncommon in the work of postwar Hegelians in France.
In this usage, the other is also the specular image
perceived and identified with in the Mirrorstage. The symbolic Other tends, in contrast, to
refer to the autonomous and effectively anonymous structures of language and the symbolic,
as well as to the unconscious, in so far as they
organize the very existence of individual
subjects.

`overdetermination 
Originally a Freudian
category, referring to the fact that formations
of the unconscious result from a plurality of
causes and/or that they are related to a multiplicity
of unconscious elements. The interpretation of
dreams, for example, discloses the work of Condensation and displacement. In the former,
a number of dream thoughts are represented in
a single image; in the latter, a significant thought
is represented in a seemingly trivial image.
The notion was adapted from Lacanian Psychoanalysis by Althusser in “Contradiction
and overdetermination” (1965, pp. 87–128). It was
deployed by him to conceptualize a “structural”
(or “metonymic”) causality distinct from the
“expressivism” of Hegelian Marxism, and the
“mechanism” of orthodox Marxism, for which
all social contradictions were manifestations of an
underlying economic contradiction. Althusser’s
endeavor went beyond the causal pluralism to
which it is reduced when “overdetermination” is
read as codetermination by the superstructural
levels. His ambition was an alternative configuration of the Social formation as a complex but
unified totality, and hence of the presence of the
social whole in its parts. Any contradiction was
marked by the other contradictions that constituted its conditions of existence within the
totality, defining the pattern of dominance and
antagonism in a given historical conjuncture.

translate Asian languages, Derrida argues, they
began to construct an ideal image or Chinese
fantasy of a perfectly complete linguistic and cultural presence that was not afflicted by European
incompleteness and absence. However, such an
idealized, hallucinated Other was simply created
to fulfill a European need. Orientalism and the
European hallucination are in this sense complementary forms of Ethnocentrism.

`patriarchy 
Literally, “patriarchy” means “rule
of the father.” In academia, the term first gained

523
birth control. Changes in those material conditions, such as the development of new reproductive
technologies in the twentieth century that severed
women from their biological role as mothers,
made possible a feminist revolution.
Other feminists took a psychological approach
to the problem of origins, finding that once the
biological processes of paternity became known
and fatherhood became a meaningful social fact,
patriarchal kinship systems evolved in response
to incest taboos: men subordinated women in
order to regulate their own homosocial relationships while simultaneously guaranteeing sexual
access to females (Mitchell, 1974).
Still others examined the archaeological record
for evidence of nonpatriarchal societies, finding
that a prehistoric, goddess-worshipping matriarchy was brutally and forcefully overthrown
by dispossessed males (Stone, 1976). Although
interest in goddess religions continues to inform
the social practices of some feminist communities and even figures prominently in theories of
ecofeminism, by the 1980s academic interest
in prepatriarchy had decidedly waned as antifoundationalist Poststructuralisms cast doubt
on the epistemological status of so-called master
narratives and generally foreclosed questions
about origins of any kind. It survived only
among post-Lacanian psychoanalytical critics,
especially proponents of écriture féminine, who
rearticulated prepatriarchy as an individual psychological state associated with the pre-Oedipal
period, before the insertion of the Subject into
language and Culture, the “law of the father.”
Yet another early problematic included questions of whether patriarchy, understood as an
overarching category of male dominance, was
analytically separable from other forms of dominance, such as racial oppression, and other modes
of production, such as capitalism, and if so,
whether it was the primary mode of women’s
oppression. Radical feminists, such as Kate
Millett (1970), argued that sexism is not only
analytically independent, but primary, the original political division in society and the model
for all other divisions, including those based on
Race and Class. Marxist feminists generally
argued against the biologizing tendencies of
radical feminist theories of patriarchy, claiming
instead that, although male dominance is autonomous and therefore analytically separable, it is

patriarchy

theoretical currency among anthropologists,
who used it to describe any society in which an
elder male (the “father”) holds absolute power over
all others in that society, including younger and
subordinate males unrelated by blood. By the
early 1970s “patriarchy” had become one of the
key terms of feminist theory. Feminists, however, tended to use the term not to indicate a
certain type of society, but to signal the concept
that male dominance is a universal organizing
principle of all societies.
Although patriarchy is manifested in an endless variety of historically and culturally specific
forms, all human societies are patriarchal in that
they are segregated and stratified by sex such
that women are oppressed in social and political institutions; they divide productive and
reproductive labor by sex and discriminate
against women economically; they privilege men
over women generally, guaranteeing men greater
and nonreciprocal access to women’s material
and immaterial resources; they value men and
Masculinity more highly than women and
Femininity; and their discursive and Symbolic
Systems centralize, standardize, and normalize
male subjectivity and points of view while casting woman as the objectified “Other.”
Patriarchy is the universal system of male
dominance that feminists aim to abolish. Not only
has the term “patriarchy” been extremely useful
in articulating relationships between seemingly
disparate sexist practices, but contests over the
meaning of the term have clarified differences
among feminist positions and been a crucial
vehicle for advancing feminist theory.
An early feminist problematic concerned the
question of patriarchy’s origin, especially whether
the transhistorical, cross-culturally universal fact
of male dominance could be explained in terms
other than those provided by biological determinism. Is male dominance, in other words,
natural and therefore inevitable, or is it the
consequence of some historical development in
Culture and therefore subject to intervention and
transformation?
Some feminists such as Shulamith Firestone
(1970) accepted the premises that “biology itself
– procreation – is at the origin of the dualism”
between male and female and that male dominance
is both natural and inevitable, but only under certain material conditions, such as lack of reliable

patriarchy

524
not independent from analysis of class formation
and struggle. Patriarchal exploitation cuts across
class lines but Gender relations and women’s
experiences of sexism are mediated by their
specific positions in the economic mode of production (Barrett, 1980).
Marxists disagreed about whether male dominance was primary: some argued that some form
of male dominance existed in all modes of
economic production; others claimed that the
general equality of men and women within economic classes in precapitalist Europe signaled
the primacy of class instead. Black feminists and
other women of color criticized the term “patriarchy” for its implication that all women form
a single, unified sex class and are identically
and equally oppressed by men. White-authored
theories of patriarchy efface differences among
women and the transection of sexual categories
by racial and ethnic ones such that some women
have considerable power over some men and
are formidable agents in the oppression of other
women (Carby, 1987). By the late 1980s these
critics were joined by postcolonial theorists
such as Gayatri Spivak (1987), who argued that
nationality is as important an axis of difference
as race, class, and Ethnicity.
At the same time, both left and right-wing
articulations of poststructural theory also exerted
pressure on feminists to question whether systemic
understandings of the social, such as those
inscribed in the term “patriarchy,” are legitimate
or illegitimate, useful or derelict. Is patriarchy
an overarching totality that exists in reality or is
the social more accurately and usefully understood only in more localized terms? As early
as the 1970s some feminists had already objected
to the large scale implied by theories of patriarchy. Gayle Rubin (1975) suggested that to avoid
analytic confusion between “patriarchy” and
sex–gender systems in general, feminists must
retain the earlier, more specific anthropological
definition. Barrett argued that certain ideological
constructions of relationships “predicated on
the Paradigm . . . of a father–daughter relationship [such as] the pathological attempts of
bourgeois fathers to insist on their daughters’
dependence . . . also represent a legitimate use of
the term” (1980, p. 15). In the 1980s feminists
influenced by Foucault rejected the inscription
in the term “patriarchy” of a notion of power

as centralized and primarily repressive and
juridical in its operations, finding it more useful
instead to understand the social as a matrix
of localized relationships infused with power,
“innumerable points of confrontation [and]
focuses of instability, each of which has its
own risks of conflict, or struggles” (Foucault,
Power/Knowledge).
Through the 1980s Foucauldian feminist theories argued that feminist practice is only possible
at the microlevels of society where power actually circulates; the question of large-scale social
Structure was put off. Such articulations of
Postmodernism, especially those also informed
by Deconstruction, tended to emphasize the
textuality of the social world, the processes by
which human subjects and identities are discursively produced. Consequently, they advanced
a political agenda in which the top priority
was to destabilize, through subversive Writing
practices, normative and totalizing relationships
between signifier and signified, between human
subjects and their identities. By the late 1980s the
distance between academic feminist theorists
and their grass-roots constituencies was wider
than it had ever been before; not only did most
activists find academic theoretical writing inaccessible, but also many of the political practices
celebrated by academics, such as miming, parody,
or pastiche, seemed absurd and irrelevant;
indeed, “ludic postmodernism” (the term is
Teresa Ebert’s) seemed to dismantle “politics”
and “feminism” altogether.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s an exciting group of feminist theorists, including
Teresa Ebert, Norma Alarcon, Evelyn BrooksHiggenbotham, Donna Haraway, and Chandra
Sandoval, have attempted to move beyond this
impasse by rewriting postmodern theories, both
in accessible terms and in terms that once more
permit analysis of large-scale social structures,
global “totalities” like patriarchy, Racism, and
capitalism. The “resistance postmodernism” that
has resulted from their efforts does not derogate
deconstruction, seeing it as a necessary intervention in patriarchal cultural politics but insufficient in itself to achieve the emancipatory project
of feminism. Instead, the great tasks of the 1990s
are to rearticulate the insights of ludic postmodernism in a theory of language that assumes
that significance is the product of social struggle and

`patristic criticism 
The term “patristic” refers
to the Fathers of the early Christian Church – St
Ambrose (c.339–97), St Jerome (c.347–419/420),
St Augustine (354–430), and Gregory the Great
(c.540–604) in the Latin Church; Basil the Great
(c.330 –c.379), Gregory of Nazianzus (c.329–
c.390), Athanasius (c.293–373), and John Chrysostom (347–407) in the Eastern Church – and
their theological commentary, as well as the
work of other ecclesiastics who lived from about
the second to the seventh or eighth century. This
period saw seven general councils of the one
universal Catholic Church; the development of
an ecclesiastical orthodoxy; and a vast scope of
patristic literature in support of Christian orthodoxy in Western culture. Excellent critical editions
of this commentary, including that of patristic
ecclesiastics who wrote from the eighth to the early
sixteenth century, are published in the voluminous
Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum
(CSEL) and Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina
(CCSL) and Series Graeca (CCSG).

During the years after Christ’s death, St Paul
actually inaugurated the typological and allegorical modes of interpreting the Gospels, when
he reconciled in his Epistles Jewish traditions
and Old Testament materials with the New
Testament scripture. In Paul’s figural or typological
method, important individuals and events of
the Old Testament were identified as “types”
prefiguring New Testament persons and actions.
Adam was held to prefigure, to be a “type” of
Christ: as Adam introduced sin into the world,
and all men who followed him were born sinners,
so Christ introduced grace and salvation into
the lives of all men (Romans 5: 12–21). An apt
example of his allegorial method occurs when
Paul reconciles the relationship between the Old
Testament covenant of law and the New Testament covenant of spiritual redemption when
he comments upon the birth of Abraham’s
two sons, Ishmael and Isaac – the first by the
slave Hagar and the second by his wife Sarah
(Galatians 4: 21–31). Paul says that Hagar represents “Sinai, a mountain in Arabia [which] corresponds to the present Jerusalem for she is in
slavery [under Roman rule] along with her
children”; but Sarah represents the heavenly
New Jerusalem and God’s promise of spiritual
liberation from sin which comes from Isaac and
his descendants through subsequent Old Testament books to be realized in the Gospels of Jesus
Christ. The Old Testament was understood by
Paul (and exegetes to follow) to be a divinely
inspired book which often in prophecies cloaked
elements of God’s eternal plan for mankind; and
its truths and promise were fulfilled in the life
and teachings of Jesus in the New Testament.
It was to the early commentators of the church
to develop patristic analysis and bring the method
to a more comprehensive, detailed explication of
biblical materials. The eastern Christian scholar,
Origen (c.185–c.254), following contemporary
practice in Alexandrian schools of interpreting the
Greek myths and Homeric works allegorically,
accepted to an extent the literal sense of scriptural
writings, but argued that more profound meanings were to be found in discovering their moral
and spiritual senses. The allegorical method
was adopted and further developed by Ambrose,
Bishop of Milan, and Augustine, Bishop of
Hippo. The importance of patristic commentary
was enormous in its own era and tremendously

patristic criticism

to theorize the highly differentiated positioning
of “women,” especially as that positioning
informs such social practices as the increasingly
specialized division of labor in multinational
capitalism, racial formation, and the formation
of colonial and postcolonial states.

influential in the centuries to follow. By the
twelfth century the method had been refined and
reached its most characteristic expression in “the
fourfold sense of interpreting sacred scripture”;
and it was employed by St Thomas Aquinas
(1225–74) and many others of his time when
writing on matters of theology, philosophy, and
moral conduct.
The first of the fourfold senses, the literal or
historical meaning, was for Thomas a fit object
for scientific study; the litterae were held to be
the “vessels” which preserved the other three,
essentially important spiritual senses. The literal
was distinguished by its historical or “carnal”
meanings, that is a Text’s worldly or earthly,
not holy or sanctified meanings. The other three
senses conveyed spiritual implications: the moral
(through which proper ethical conduct is
inferred); the allegorical, typological, or figural;
and the anagogical (in which biblical references
relate to Christian eschatology, the events to
come in the days of the Last Judgment or in the
afterlife of individual souls). A classic, nonbiblical literary use of this method was set forth by
Dante (1265–1321) in his letter to Can Grande
della Scalla (c.1318); here the poet explicitly
describes how the fourfold scriptural meanings
should be employed to interpret his Divina
Commedia (c.1307–21).
Through the patristic and medieval periods and
into the early sixteenth century, this Hermeneutic, or method of biblical interpretation,
often was varied to accommodate the interest
of the commentator who offered the exegesis
(the interpretation). Of course, some exegetes
emphasized one or another of the four levels of
meaning at the expense of others, while many
employed two or more levels simultaneously.
Inasmuch as the Bible has been regarded as a
sacred book, there were those who argued that
commentary in its literal sense was the most
(or only) legitimate interpretation since the
Scriptures were inspired by God who through
them speaks to mankind, always saying what is
intended. None the less, the vast body of scriptural interpretation which developed and has
come to be associated with patristic exegesis
followed the method of differentiating and
commenting upon the littera, or obvious meaning of the text, and its sententia, or spiritual and
doctrinal meanings.

The writings of the exegetical tradition have over
the centuries been of great interest to scholars
in history, theology, and philosophy in attempting to research and understand the thinking
and beliefs which permeated the early Christian
world and so influenced the entire medieval
period that followed. The strength of the continuing patristic influence upon Western thought can
also be seen in the use of typological and allegorical
elements in the work of such post-Middle Ages
writers as George Herbert, Edmund Spenser,
William Blake, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Over
the centuries work by some textual critics,
philologists, biblical scholars, and art historians
has often included study of and research into
patristic texts.
However, a new direction in patristic commentary was inaugurated during the early 1950s
by several literary critics, like the American
scholar D.W. Robertson, when they proposed
that much secular Poetry of the medieval
period was written against the background of
patristic thought, and that it had to be taken
into account when attempting an analysis of
medieval literary texts. Strenuous objections were
raised to this approach by other critics, such as
E. Talbot Donaldson, who argued that at least
two questionable assumptions lay behind the
method: (i) that orthodox belief did not change
from the time of the patristic Fathers to Aquinas;
and (ii) that patristic interpretations and references
were available to secular writers and had a good
chance of being understood by their audiences.
None the less, Robertson and others argued with
much success that obvious bibilical allusions
and citations carried a recognizable tradition of
thought from the patristic period into the medieval, and the patristic exegetical tradition itself
offered a vast index of commentary and provided excellent background for understanding
bibilical associations and motifs of medieval secular literature. Chaucer and other contemporary
secular authors were not to be read as exegetes
solemnly interpreting the Vulgate Bible, but as
artists who used biblical references and elements
of Christian tradition in evocative, novel ways.
Moreover, to be understood by their audiences,
which were largely aristocratic and educated, these
writers need not have a systematized, exhaustive
knowledge of the vast exegetical writings of patristic thought, only an understanding of tenets and

`Peirce, Charles Sanders (1839–1914)
American philosopher. As a cofounder of both
Semiotics and pragmatism, Peirce is justly considered one of the most important and most
innovative of American philosophers. He is,
however, also one of the most neglected, which
may in part be the result of his inability to
resolve the rival demands of popular and professional authorship. His technical language
and rigorous arguments lost him the kind of
informed general audience that Emerson, James,
and Dewey were able to attract; but his failure to
publish a major book – despite his many brilliant
if scattered papers, lectures, letters, and essays –
deprived him of the appropriate professional
recognition as well. In a footnote to his seminal
pragmatist essay “How to make our ideas clear,”
Peirce wrote: “Consider what effects, that might
conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive
the object of our conception to have. Then, our
conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object” (Peirce, 1958, p. 181). If this
cardinal principle of pragmatism were applied to
Peirce’s own work, it would appear fitting that he
is celebrated for the effects of his ideas on other
thinkers. Peirce’s writings, none the less, range
widely over topics that remain crucial for contemporary philosophy: the foundational role of
logic, the history and philosophy of Science,

significant interpretations, biblical tales, and
Symbolic images that had permeated medieval
social thought. Some authors like Chaucer, none
the less, were obviously well read in early ecclesiatical writers such as Boethius (470/5–525).
The element of love appearing in secular medieval literature, specifically the cupiditas dominant
in courtly love – for example in Geoffrey
Chaucer’s Troilus and Cressida or Chrétien de
Troyes’s Percival – was set in satiric relief against
(at times even reconciled with) the church’s
teachings about Christian love, caritas. Absolon’s
frustrated lust and misadventures when pursuing
Alison in Chaucer’s “The miller’s tale” is artfully
explicated in this manner by Robert Kaske (see
Bethurum, 1961, pp. 52–60). Kaske demonstrates
how a knowledge of commentary by patristic
exegetes of the Song of Solomon enhances the
comedy of Chaucer’s tale by contrasting the
carnal love of Absolon and Alison with that
found by exegetes in the relationship between the
lovers in the Song of Solomon.
During the 1950s and 1960s the work of literary critics like Robertson, Kaske, and Bernard
Huppe in explicating texts through study of
patristic commentary received considerable
favorable attention among scholars, and has had
an ongoing impact on the teaching of medieval
literature in schools today. However, with the
advent of postmodern criticism during the late
1960s and 1970s, patristic analysis (based as it
is upon the assumption of divinely inspired
bibilical truth) has been edged from a place of
prominence in literary scholarship.

pragmatism, semiotics, and epistemology. His
pioneering work in semiotics, however, has the
greatest continuing importance for Cultural
and Critical theory. Indeed, Clifford Geertz
(1973, p. 5) has argued that Culture is principally a semiotic concept.
Peirce’s “Some consequences of four incapacities” sets forth the essence of his theory of the
Sign. Although everything that appears to consciousness, he argues, is a “phenomenal manifestation of ourselves,” that does not preclude the
possibility of there being a phenomenon of
something without us. At the moment when we
think, we appear to ourselves as a sign. A sign has
three references: (i) to some thought that interprets it; (ii) for some object that it is thought to
be equivalent; (iii) in some respect that connects
it with its object. However, since a sign is not
identical with what it signifies, it must have
some characteristics unique to itself. These are,
first, the representative function which makes
it a representation; second, the pure denotative
application, or real connection, which brings one
thought into relation with another; and third,
the material quality, or how it feels, which gives
thought its quality (Peirce, 1868, p. 56). It is typical of Peirce that his most lucid elaboration of
this semiotic theory appears in his letter, dated 12
October 1904 (Peirce, 1958, pp. 381–93) to Lady
Viola Welby, the author of What Is Meaning? It
may not be accidental – or costly to his reputation – that Peirce had important connections
with early developments of Feminism in America
through his first wife, whom he divorced. Peirce
was always a prototypical intellectual in that he
was an exile even in the midst of the New England
academic world into which he was born. He died
in poverty, and his widow sold his papers – most
of them at that time unpublished – to Harvard
University for $500, after President Eliot and
the trustees of the University had ignored even
William James’s pleas on his behalf. The year
after Peirce’s death a version of Saussure’s
Cours de Linguistique générale was published,
which has continued to eclipse the American
philosopher’s unique contribution to semiotics.

`performative utterances 
J.L. Austin’s introduction of the “performative utterance,” in his
1955 William James Lectures at Harvard University (published as How to Do Things with Words,
1962), challenged orthodox ways of understanding
language and meaning, most notably philosophers’ tendency to treat as paradigmatic statements
that truly or falsely describe states of affairs.
Such statements Austin dubbed “constatives.” In
contrast, Austin observed that for a whole class
of sentences, “to utter the sentence . . . is not to
describe my doing or to state that I am doing it:
it is to do it.” To utter the words “I promise to
meet you,” “I pronounce you husband and wife,”
or “I christen this boat the Queen Mary” is not
merely to describe a promise, marriage, or ship
name, but it is to perform the action of promising, marrying, or naming. To say is to do, in
Austin’s words.
Had Austin pushed the matter no further,
the constative–performative contrast might be
an interesting footnote in the philosophy of language. But in the span of twelve lectures, Austin
mounts an escalating challenge to traditional
theories, ultimately rejecting any sharp distinction
between these two sorts of utterance and urging
us to consider the performative aspect of all
constative utterances.
In the first few lectures, Austin notes that performative utterances, while not true or false, are
susceptible to certain infelicities. The marriage
pronouncement “misfires” if I am not authorized
to perform it; an empty promise is a form of
“abuse.” In the middle lectures, Austin observes
that constatives can be similarly infelicitous. And
so, to more crisply distinguish between the two
sorts of utterances, he devotes a string of lectures
to a search for a grammatical or lexical criterion
of the performative. Finding none, he does not
retreat from his remarks about the performative,
but instead comes to see the constative as a subspecies of performative utterances. Later lectures
may appear to veer off-topic, for they introduce
a new set of distinctions concerning the use of

A condensation of “phallocentrism” and “logocentrism,” originally coined
by Derrida (1967, 1980) and given wider currency by deconstructionist critiques of the privileging of the logos as the site of truth, and by
feminist critiques of Patriarchy, and especially of the primacy ascribed to the Phallus by
Lacan.

`phallus 
The term is rarely used by Freud,
who normally employed it to refer to the ancient
symbol of sovereign power (Freud, 1910, p. 125;
1918, p. 204). The adjective “phallic” is common
in Freud, but the noun form is usually (Freud,
1923) simply synonymous with penis. Although
Freud consistently refers (1905) to a phallic stage

in development in which sexual difference is
held by the child to be predicated on a castrated
(female)/noncastrated (male) distinction, he
does not elaborate any concept of the phallus as
such. In Lacanian Psychoanalysis, “phallus” is
used to emphasize the Symbolic value taken on
by the biological organ in intersubjective relations
and in the course of accession to the symbolic.
For some feminists the theory of the phallus
offers a means of escaping Freud’s residual
biologism and constructing a theory of sexual
difference which places more emphais on cultural
and symbolic factors (Mitchell, 1974).
Lacan’s concept of the phallus was elaborated
primarily in his writings of the 1950s. In the
1956 seminar on the psychoses (Lacan, 1981) the
phallus is held to be the mediating element in
the castration complex, an imaginary object
which the child finally accepts as being in the
father’s possession. It is in the important paper
on the meaning of the phallus (Lacan, 1958) that
Lacan begins to speak of the phallus as a privileged signifier which marks the articulation of
desire and the logos. From this new perspective,
the phallus is the object of the mother’s desire and
the child attempts to identify with that object
in order to satisfy both the mother’s desire and
its own desire for the mother. The phallus is,
however, a signifier or symbol (there is some
confusion over this in both Lacan and the work
of his followers) and the child cannot be that
signifier. It is the child’s entry into the symbolic
that will allow it to accept that the phallus is not
the attribute of an individual, but the signifier
of sexual difference itself. It is this articulation of
desire, lack, and language which exposes Lacan to
the accusation of Phallogocentrism.
One of the more disturbing features of arguments about the status of the phallus is that,
while Lacan and his followers insist that the
phallus–penis distinction is to be found in
Freud, they often rely upon French translations
which introduce a distinction that does not
exist in either the German or the English Text.
Attempts to locate the phallus–penis distinction
in Freud should therefore be viewed with some
suspicion.

language to do something. In uttering a single
sentence, we perform a locutionary act (we convey a certain literal meaning), an illocutionary act
(we judge, endorse, promise), and any number
of perlocutionary acts (we intimidate, convince,
or surprise our audience). But this new distinction is the key to understanding that the
constative–performative contrast is really just a
matter of degree. When we attend to a so-called
constative utterance, we focus on its locutionary
force; in contrast, the illocutionary force commands our attention in the case of performative
utterances.
Later writers have in various ways challenged
or adapted Austin’s treatment of the constative–
performative distinction. In Feminist philosophy,
the notion of the “performative” has been adapted
by Judith Butler to describe gender as continually constructed rather than immutably fixed.

`phenomenological reduction 
Phenomenological reduction is another name for the method
of “bracketing” applied by Husserl in his phenomenological philosophy. The name is used to
stand for three different procedures: in each
case, something is “bracketed” and something
is the “residue.” First, there is the eidetic reduction: in this case one “brackets” the existence
as well as the variable features of a class of things,
the purpose being to let the invariant features
or the eidos stand out as the residue. Second,
“phenomenological–psychological reduction”:
in this case, one “brackets” the question of
existence or nonexistence of the object in an
intentional act (such as perceiving or believing)
the residue is the object-as-intended (that is,
as believed or as perceived) as the correlate of
the intentional act, or what is technically called
the noema–noesis correlation. Third, the transcendental reduction (or, BpochB): one brackets the
basic belief-in-the-world, so that consciousness
(with its noesis–noema structure) is exhibited
as the transcendental, meaningconferring, and
world-constituting source.

`phenomenology 
A twentieth-century philosophical movement distinguished by a concentration on descriptions of experience which reveal
the “meanings” things have for human beings prior
to theoretical interpretation. Phenomenology has
exerted an immense influence on both cultural and
Literary criticism.
The term “phenomenology,” which derives
from a Greek word for “appearance,” was first
coined in the eighteenth century to refer to the
“theory of illusion,” but its meaning was soon
widened. For Kant, phenomenology was the
study of phenomena, by which he meant
actual and possible objects of experience (real or
illusory), as distinct from unknowable “things-inthemselves” or noumena. For Hegel, it was the
study of the various forms which consciousness
has taken in history on the way to the mind’s
absolute knowledge of itself. During the nineteenth
century it came to mean, for the most part, little
more than the descriptive study of any given
subject matter (see Schmitt, 1967).
It is with the work of the German philosopher
Edmund Husserl and his collaborators, in the
first decades of the twentieth century, that the term
becomes the name of a distinctive philosophical
tendency. Several of Husserl’s definitions of
“phenomenology” presuppose the truth of his
own controversial claims, with the unwelcome
consequence that, for someone who does not
accept those claims, there can be no such discipline. For example, if it is defined as “the theory
of the essential nature of the transcendentally
purified consciousness” (Husserl, 1962, p. 161),
then the possibility of phenomenology depends
on the (disputed) existence of such a consciousness. So it is better to understand “phenomenology” as referring to both Husserl’s own
philosophical position (at least, from about 1910
onwards) and any other which is sufficiently
similar to this. How similar is similar? It is
unfortunate to impose such strict criteria that
Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-ponty,
and Jean-Paul Sartre are denied the label. For
one thing, they all called themselves “phenomenologists”; for another, Husserl’s own thinking,
during his final years, was moving in the directions taken by these writers. Most important,
however, there are a number of Husserlian themes
to which, despite important modulations, these
philosophers also subscribe. I shall follow the

531

Common Themes The first theme is that of the
primacy of “fundamental description.” This
reflects the traditional conception of philosophy
as a “basic” inquiry which refuses to take for
granted the assumptions made – reasonably
enough for their own purposes – by other disciplines. The ambitions of these other disciplines,
notably the natural sciences, are typically those
of analysis, explanation, justification (of beliefs
and theories), and prediction. However, these
ambitions presuppose a level at which what is
analyzed, explained, etc. is properly described
and identified. Such descriptions must, moreover, be fundamental in the sense that they do
not covertly contain the results of analyses and
theories. Otherwise, we would not have reached
the “basic” level. These “fundamental descriptions”
at which philosophy aims must, therefore, be
of things as they are “for us,” as encountered in
ordinary, untutored experience. For any description of things – in terms, say, of their molecular
composition – which was disjoint with such experience could only be the product of “tutored”
theorizing. It is this return to a level of “fundamental description” of things which is enjoined
by the favorite slogan of phenomenology, Zu den
Sachen (“Back to the things themselves”). (See,
for example, Husserl, 1962, p. 74f; Heidegger,
1980, p. 50.)
Unfortunately, this return to “the things themselves” is remarkably difficult, since even our
everyday thinking is imbued with theoretical
assumptions and “prejudices.” Hence – the second common theme – the need for an operation
of “abstaining from” or “bracketing” such
assumptions and “pre-judices.” (Husserl uses
the Greek word epochB for this operation). The
point is less to call such assumptions into doubt
than simply “to put them out of play,” so that they
do not infect our “fundamental descriptions.” A

phenomenological description of colors, for
example, will have “bracketed” scientific considerations about light waves and the like. The
example indicates a third theme, what MerleauPonty calls the “foreswearing of science” (1981,
p. viii). It is not simply that, along with all other
theoretical assumptions, those of the sciences
must be “bracketed” – though, given the
immense prestige of the sciences and the pretension of some scientists to be offering the only
correct account of things, this “bracketing” is
especially urgent. Two further points are being
made. First, the accounts of the world and ourselves offered by the sciences are necessarily
parasitic on a more “primordial” one which they
cannot therefore overturn. Second, the sciences
typically have excessive explanatory ambitions,
particularly in the field of human consciousness
and behavior. What “fundamental description”
will reveal is that our experiences and actions are
not of the right kind to lend themselves to the
causal explanations of science.
Of what kind are they, then? The answer is
contained in the fourth theme, the doctrine of
intentionality. This notion is variously interpreted within the phenomenological movement,
but on two central points there is agreement.
First, many of our mental states and actions
are irreducibly “directed toward” or “about”
objects. To hope or to search is to hope or to search
for something. Any adequate description of such
a state or action must therefore make reference
to its object, and cannot consist simply in an
account of, say, certain “sense data” or bodily
movements which are occurring. Second, it is a
crucial feature of these “intentional” states and
actions that their objects do not have actually to
exist. The child hopes for Santa Claus’s arrival;
the Spaniards searched for El Dorado; the
drunkard keeps seeing pink rats. Hence the relation between an “intentional” state and its object
cannot be a causal one. Rather it is one of
“meaning.” What makes it possible for a linguistic expression to be “about” something, even
when (like “Santa Claus”) it refers to nothing in
reality, is its possession of a meaning or sense.
Similarly, an “intentional” state or action has a
“meaning” which may or may not be satisfied by
an actual object or goal. The central focus of
phenomenological description is therefore upon
the meanings through which we are related to our

phenomenology

familiar practice of describing Husserl’s phenomenology as “pure” and that of the later writers as
“existential.”
After listing the common themes to which
all phenomenologists, in their different ways,
subscribe, I outline Husserl’s “pure” position
and then the criticisms leveled against this by his
“existential” successors. Finally, I consider some
ramifications of phenomenology in the fields of
cultural and Literary criticism.

world. Since possession of meaning is essential to
our experiences and actions, and since meanings
are not the kind of thing susceptible to the causal
explanations of the sciences, the fundamental
examination of experience and action cannot be
a natural scientific one.
As the example of hope indicates, it is not
only “cognitive” mental states which relate us
to the world through a network of meanings.
“Affective” states – moods, emotions, and so on
– are also “directed” and possess significance, so
that the examination of these can yield important
results for our understanding of ourselves and the
world. This is the last of the common themes:
the insistence on the philosophical importance
of “affective” intentionality. A good example is
provided by the phenomenon of Angst which
Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty, in their
different ways, all regard as revelatory of crucial
dimensions of our relationship to the world.
Certainly it is not to be treated as a mere “inner
stirring” or discomfort. (See, for example, Sartre,
1957, pp. 27ff, where it is argued that Angst is
an experience of oneself as totally free to decide
one’s actions.)
I have stated these common themes in terms
sufficiently broad for most phenomenologists
to subscribe to. However, much of the interest
yielded by the literature of this movement
resides in the more detailed – and contentious
– ways in which different philosophers have
developed and modulated the themes. I begin with
the “pure” position of Husserl.
“Pure” or Transcendental Phenomenology For
Husserl, phenomenological descriptions of objects
and our experiences of them aspire to be “fundamental,” not only in the sense of being free
from “prejudices,” but in being a priori and
“apodictic.” That is, they must be necessarily,
indubitably, and self-evidently true. This is the
point of his defining phenomenology as a
“rigorous science” which “aims exclusively at
establishing ‘knowledge of essences’ ” (1962, p. 40).
It is to be achieved, in part, by what Husserl calls
“eidetic reduction.” For an object of my experience to count as a tree, I must “intuit” it to have
those features which remain invariable as a I
“freely imagine” the object altering all its other
features, while remaining a tree. These invariable
features constitute its essence or eidos.

However, a more radical “reduction” is required if we are to exclude irrelevant matters
from our descriptions. Since the actual existence
of objects is contingent and dubitable, we must
“bracket” the “natural attitude” which takes
such existence for granted. Although the world
“goes on appearing as it appeared before . . . the
natural believing in [its] existence” is suspended
(1977, p. 20). Now, among the “objects” whose
existence is thus “bracketed” are ourselves, considered as embodied persons or “empirical”/
“natural” egos. With this “reduction,” “there
exists no ‘I’ . . . the natural human ego . . . is
reduced to the transcendental ego” (1975, p. 10).
This latter is not an object of experience – not a
denizen of the world, if such exists – but the “pure”
Subject or “spectator” which remains after
everything else has been “bracketed.”
Unlike some other philosophers, such as Descartes, who – if only for methodological reasons
– have “reduced” the world to the operations of
a conscious subject, Husserl is insistent that our
mental states must generally be understood as
directed toward objects. But since these objects
of consciousness are “intentional” ones, the
nonexistence of their “correlates” in reality, like
Santa Claus, is no obstacle. Description of these
states contains two components, which Husserl
calls the “noetic” and “noematic.” A noetic description of seeing a tree focuses on what makes
the act one of seeing rather than, say, touching
or remembering the tree. Its noematic description is of the “meaning” of such acts. This,
crudely put, is an account of the conditions
which would have to be met for the object of
the acts actually to exist. Thus the act of seeing a
tree creates expectations of further experiences
I must be able to obtain by way of confirming
that I was indeed seeing a tree. This has an
important implication for “the nature of reality.”
In one sense Husserl is not denying the real existence of things, since we sometimes do obtain
the anticipated experiences which confirm such
judgments as “I am seeing a tree.” On the other
hand, no sense can be made of the idea of a
world existing independently of consciousness.
This is because the very sense of “The tree exists”
can only be given in terms of the “fulfilling,”
by further experiences, of the conditions contained in the noetic content – the “meaning”
– of conscious acts. For this reason, Husserl

533

“Existential” Phenomenology The shift from
“pure” to “existential” phenomenology occurs
with Heidegger’s insistence that “[human] existence is more than mere cognition in the usual
spectator sense,” for this “presupposes existence” (1982, p. 276). The source of understanding and meaning, therefore, is not Husserl’s
“disinterested spectator of [the] worldly ego and
its life,” but the thoroughly “worldly” human
agent in his living engagement with the world.
With this shift, the distinctive claims of “pure”
phenomenology must be either abandoned or
radically revised.
To begin with, it no longer makes sense totally
to suspend “the natural attitude,” to “bracket” the
whole of empirical reality. That would require,
impossibly, that we could entirely detach ourselves
from that very engagement with the world which
is presupposed by “mere cognition.” Nor can
it be a sensible ambition to offer a complete
description of our experience, for any description
is made by people from the viewpoint of a “situation” which they cannot, at the same time,
submit to detached examination. My very adaption to the world in a certain way, says Sartre,
means that I cannot completely “decipher” it
(1957, p. 200).
It follows next that, if I cannot “reduce” the
whole of empirical reality, there is no such entity
as the “pure” or “transcendental” ego – for that
was supposed to be what was left over after such

a “reduction.” The notion of “pure” egos is
problematic on other grounds. Stripped of all
physical and other empirical features, how
could they be individuated? Why suppose, with
Husserl, that there are many such egos and not,
say, just one “branching” ego? If we must speak
of the self at all, says Heidegger, this can only be
“the factual self, the concrete person” (1962,
p. 602).
Most important of all, perhaps, the central
notion of intentionality must be rethought. By
“bracketing” the world and encapsulating the
objects of experience within the conscious subject,
Husserl perverts that notion, whose importance,
surely, is to stress that experience is intelligible
only as directed towards what is “outside.”
Intentional experience is not the cognition of
“meanings” or “essences” which may or may not
be “fulfilled” by things in a real world, but, first
and foremost, the understanding which permeates our intelligent, purposive dealings with the
world. Meanings are not timeless “essences” to
grasp through intuition, but the purposes which
inform our actions and the “significations”
which things assume for us in the light of those
purposes. The “meaning” of a hammer is not a
noema or schema which some objects might fit,
but the role the hammer plays in relation to
other objects and to our own projects. For this
reason, Merleau-Ponty argues that the human
Body, far from being just one more “bracketable” item in the world, is itself a crucial
source of meaning. It is through the body that
there is “imposition of meaning” (1981, p. 147).
“Existential” phenomenology retains the
thought that in a sense the world is dependent
on human beings. But this sense is not Husserl’s.
The point is no longer that the world can only
be understood as that which would “fulfill”
the expectations implicit in acts of perception. It
is, rather, that the world is a totality of significant objects, each of which only obtains its
significance – its identity, indeed – through the
place it occupies in a network of human activities and purposes.
Culture and Literature Analytic philosophers
have, for the most part, regarded the philosophical enterprise as a relatively modest and selfcontained one. Phenomenologists, on the other
hand, took themselves to be addressing, in the

phenomenology

describes his philosophy as a form of “transcendental idealism.”
Husserl himself wrote relatively little on the
“meanings” of emotional and affective mental
states, concentrating primarily on perceptual
acts. Nevertheless, some of his associates did
address these areas, a good example being Max
Scheler’s account of moral experience (1954).
It is, Scheler argues, totally unfaithful to such
experience to regard moral evaluation as the
mere expression of a “subjective” mood or personal preference. A moral evaluation is necessarily experienced by its subjects as directed
toward objective features, values. (It is interesting to note that some recent anti-objectivists in
analytic moral philosophy concede that their
position flies in the face of the “feel” that moral
judgments have for us. See, for example, Mackie,
1978, pp. 48f.)

most fundamental way, what Husserl and
Heidegger respectively called “the crisis of European existence” and “our destitute age.” The
modern crisis, as they saw it, was rooted in
underlying attitudes for which phenomenology
could provide a cure.
None was more messianic than Husserl himself during his final writings of the 1930s. Europe,
he argued, had fallen victim to a “barbarian
hatred of spirit,” reflected in a new “tribalism” and
nationalism, in a return to myth, and in moral
nihilism or relativism – in short, in a rejection of
rationality. Since, for Husserl, the distinctive
glory of “Western man” was the pursuit and
exercise of universal reason, this was a tragedy.
His main point, however, was that this loss of
faith in reason was an understandable reaction
against the perverted notion of rationality which
had become increasingly dominant since the
Renaissance. “The European crisis has its roots
in a mistaken rationalism . . . its exteriorization,
its absorption in ‘naturalism’ and ‘objectivism’”
(Husserl, 1965, pp. 179 and 191).
There are two main aspects to this “mistaken
rationalism.” First, the “mathematicization of
the world” by the natural sciences: the pretense,
that is, that the world of experience – including
the meanings and values there encountered – is
a merely subjective illusion behind which lies the
only real world, that of the measurable entities of
the sciences. (Heidegger was to make a similar
point in his critique of technology.) Second, the
reduction of mind or spirit – which, in truth, is
the source of all meaning, including that attaching to the statements of science – to something
merely “objective” (the brain, perhaps, or a
mechanical “mental substance” distinguished
only by the “stuff ” of which it is composed). It
was inevitable, Husserl argues, that there should
be an “irrationalist” revulsion against a rationality which so reduced the world and ourselves,
thereby debarring itself from even discussing the
moral and spiritual issues which are the most
vital concerns of human beings. The solution, of
course, is to recapture an earlier ideal of rationality,
not yet infected with “objectivism”: an ideal now
kept alive in the ambitions of transcendental
phenomenology.
The relegation to the sphere of what is “merely
subjective” of anything not encompassed in
the “objective” world of the sciences was also a

target for criticism by phenomenologists writing
on culture in the narrower sense of the arts and
literature. A central figure here was the Polish
philosopher, Roman Ingarden. Much of his
work consisted in drawing careful distinctions
between genuinely aesthetic and nonaesthetic
attitudes to works of art, and between the very
different “objects” often confused under the
heading of “work of art.” For example, we must
distinguish between the novel as a work of art
proper, its physical or “existential substrate,”
and the “aesthetic object” which emerges when
the reader “concretizes” the work by imaginatively reconstructing what is left indeterminate
by the author (a character’s face, say). However,
a constant target of Ingarden is the familiar idea
that ascriptions of value to a work of art merely
register the subjective pleasures of the audience.
For one thing, it is impossible to specify the
relevant pleasures except as those ensuing on
the recognition of the work’s own value. For
another, “if these pleasures constituted the sole
value . . . it would not be possible to attribute
value to the work itself,” but only to our own states
(Ingarden, 1979, p. 43). This would contradict
the undeniable phenomenological fact that it is
the work itself to which value is ascribed.
Another “classic” in the phenomenology of
literature is Sartre’s distinction between two
kinds of writing – mischievously labeled “prose”
and “Poetry.” In the former, words are used
to present and talk about things; in the latter,
the words are themselves the things presented.
Hence the criteria for judging “prose” and
“poetry” are quite different. Only in the former
case, for example, is the author’s political and
moral “commitment” relevant (Sartre, 1983,
ch. I).

`photography 
Critical thought on photography in the twentieth century has encompassed
arguments in the early part of the century for
its acceptance as an Art form, writings on the
impact of photography upon more traditional
art media, the development of a history of the
medium, and recent work by writers and artists
to develop a theory for the medium. Much
recent work in photography draws from various
currents in postmodern thought (see Postmodernism) in an attempt to deconstruct
modernism (see Modernity) in art, to replace the
master narratives of high formalism with “the
discourse of others” (Foster, 1983), and to lead
to the recognition of the art object (image) as a
contingent entity. For those writers and artists who

have produced this recent work, postmodernism
can best be defined as a crisis in Western representation in which photography has played a
central critical role. The influence of Critical
theory on the work of these artists and writers
is crucial to understanding their projects, and
many of the relevant theorists focus upon photography because of its interdisciplinary nature.
The adaptability of the medium is perhaps its
only governing characteristic. This is evident in
the diverse uses of the medium in Culture,
art being only a small portion of its “use.” The
basis for many of the questions arising in the
prominent art of the 1980s drew from philosophical and interdisciplinary resources, such
as Phenomenology, Literary criticism,
Semiotics, Marxism, feminism, and Psychoanalysis. Primary to these projects were questions
of audience and institutional constraints placed
upon meaning evident in high modernist art.
The influence on the art world of these theories
has meant a dissolving of boundaries between
disciplines and between theory and practice. A pertinent example of the latter is feminist art, which
relies on critical intervention as a “tactical necessity” (Foster, 1983). The blurring of boundaries
mirrors similar occurrences in other more traditional academic disciplines. The crossing of theory and practice is also evident in the increasing
number of practicing artists who are also critical
writers on photography.
To better understand the postmodern project
and photography’s role in it, it is first necessary
to examine the development of photography as
a modernist medium.
The first comprehensive history of the medium
was written by Beaumont Newhall (1937). Originally conceived as a catalogue for the Museum
of Modern Art exhibition “Photography: 1839–
1937,” Newhall’s History of Photography became
the book that was crucial to photography’s being
accepted as a legitimate art form. The study of
photography as a distinct discipline gained acceptance through the development of its official
history; and Newhall’s book, which has been
revised and expanded several times, continues
to serve as an important text on photographic
history. Newhall places particular emphasis upon
the “Purist” version of the medium’s history,
neglecting to cover the varied cultural contexts
in which photographs operate. This version of

the medium was carried through exhibitions at
the Museum of Modern Art in New York for
decades, beginning with the curatorial visions of
photographer Edward Steichen and later with
John Szarkowski.
A group of like-minded photographers in the
first twenty years of the century loosely associated
under the term “Purism” sought to establish
photography as an art form through the identification of characteristics and qualities inherent
to the medium. Modernism in photography, and
likewise in painting, sought to establish a “universal” photographic form, the depoliticization
of art, and an emphasis upon the purity and
autonomy of the medium as an art form. Among
those characteristics considered as solely “photographic” were sharpness of focus with highly
rendered detail and an unmanipulated approach
to subject matter. Photographers influenced by
this aesthetic formed a group, referred to as the
“f-64 group,” named for the smallest aperture
on a large format lens producing the sharpest
of detail.
One of the chief proponents of the Purist
aesthetic was a practitioner, Alfred Steiglitz.
Steiglitz led the way to having photography
accepted as an art form, through his many activities, including his 291 Gallery, and through the
journal Camerawork, which controlled not only
the production but also the promotion of his
own work and the work of others he supported.
Steiglitz wanted to elevate photography to the
status of painting, poetry, and sculpture; and
he was instrumental in developing photography
as a modernist medium.
Ironically, early in his career, Steiglitz was
associated with Pictorialism, whose aesthetic ran
directly counter to the desires of the Purists. The
Pictorialist aesthetic was characterized by highly
contrived tableaux settings similar to period
paintings. Pictorialism was later criticized by the
Purists for excessive sentimentality and for being
too derivative from painting. It soon became
equated with popular “low art” and its aesthetic
was disregarded. A.D. Coleman in his 1976 essay
“The directorial mode” believed that histories of
the medium neglect this area and focus almost
solely on the Purists’ ideals for the medium.
In order to develop the medium as an art form,
the Purists reconciled form with self-expression
through abstraction in ways similar to painting

of that day. In his 1975 essay “On the invention
of photographic meaning,” an essay highly
influenced by the writing of Roland Barthes,
Allan Sekula cites Steiglitz’s own description of how
his most famous image “The Steerage” occurred,
in order to highlight the desire of modernist
photography to deny the representational status
of the photograph. In the 1920s Steiglitz produced
a series of images of clouds he called “Equivalents,” where the narrative is completely dropped
out of the photograph. Steiglitz saw these images
as equivalent to feelings and emotions. Purist
ideals in the work of other photographers,
such as Paul Strand, Edward Weston, Imogene
Cunningham, and Ansel Adams, likewise emphasized individual expression, abstract form,
and an apolitical approach to subject matter.
Photographic Purism in Europe was led by
Lazlo Moholy-Nagy and the Bauhaus school
aesthetic of “form following function.” The
Bauhaus, influenced by the Russian Constructivists, called for a revitalized art, a more democratic art form that emphasized experimentation
with an objective scientific eye. Photography fit
into their new vision well as it represented not
only an art form accessible to the masses but
also one that utilized the latest of scientific technologies. The European brand of modernism
had a political base, while the American version
was apolitical, emphasizing individual expression and genius. In the USA the Bauhaus aesthetic
found its way to the Institute of Design in
Chicago through Moholy-Nagy, who founded
the school as the New Bauhaus School of Design
in 1937. Aaron Siskind and Harry Callahan later
formed one of the first graduate programs there
and influenced a generation of photographers.
Siskind’s work merged sensibilities from both
schools of thought – his close-up, flattened views
of painted signs and decaying walls resemble the
abstract expressionist paintings of Franz Kline,
while remaining within the spirit of experimentation. Man Ray, an American who was first
influenced by Steiglitz’s Purist vision, made his
career primarily in Paris, working closely with
Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists. For Man
Ray, photography was but one of many media
available for use: the idea was of primary importance over the actual art object.
In the USA, a split was formed in the early
part of the century between photography that

537
a difference between American and European
documentary photography. Sander, whose project
was to document the German people before the
Second World War according to their profession, treated all his subjects in the same cool
way. His project was thus vastly different from the
FSA project. In her book, Sontag comments on
the photography of other artists, as well as on
aspects of the medium outside of the art world,
such as tourist photography, family photography, police records, billboards, and advertising.
Sontag positions the medium as a broad cultural
phenomenon whose influence on seeing and
knowledge is far reaching.
One of the first theorists to write on photography within a political context was Walter
Benjamin. Benjamin wrote of the impact of
technology on several branches of art and in his
essay “The work of art in the age of mechanical
reproduction” (1936). Benjamin identified the
issue of authenticity and art as beginning with the
trade of art objects. With mechanical reproduction possible with photography, the authority
of the art object, or what Benjamin terms its
unique “aura,” is eroded. A plurality of copies now
replaces the unique existence of the original.
Perhaps one of the most profound ramifications
of mechanical reproduction for art addressed in
the essay is the notion that art is no longer based
on Ritual but instead on politics. The basis
for this notion resides in the reduced distance
between viewer and art object afforded by reproductions of works of art formerly not available
for viewing to a wide audience. The “cult value”
of a work of art decreases as its accessibility
increases. Benjamin cites stone age cave drawings
and medieval cathedral statues not visible from
ground level as examples of work made for magical and spiritual purposes as opposed to being
produced to “be on view.” This emancipation from
ritual provided a new function for art, which he
terms the “artistic function.”
John Berger in the early 1970s wrote an
extension of Benjamin’s thoughts into the interpretation of advertising imagery. He cites a
connection between the strategies of oil painting
and those of advertising photography, through
capitalization on desire. Berger’s treatment of
advertising photography predates later work of
artists and writers, primarily in the 1980s, who
critique the strategies of advertising practices.

photography

utilized the social character of the medium and
work that fitted into the purist conception of
“art” photography. Socially conscious photographers, such as Lewis Hine, Walker Evans,
and much later Robert Frank, believed the “art”
of photography lay in its ability to document
the everyday world. In the case of Hine, who was
trained as a sociologist, the original context
for his work reveals the political nature of these
images. His work frequently illustrated pamphlets for liberal social reform and was involved
in such projects as exposing the horrors of child
labor. Sekula described the split between art
photography and documentary photography as
“symbolist folk-myth versus a realist folk-myth”
(Sekula, 1975). In the work of the Purists the photographer is a seer, art being the expression of
inner truth. In documentary, the photographer
is a witness, and the photograph is a reportage of
empirical truth.
Hine and Evans, along with other photographers
such as Dorthea Lange and Ben Shahn, were
employed by the United States government in the
1930s as part of the Farm Security Administration Project headed by Roy Stryker. The FSA
Project aimed to document the rural poor to
appeal to the sensibilities of middle class urbanites. Historian James Curtis exposed the ideology
behind this project. He found images not
officially released by the project, which reveal an
explicit political agenda behind the choice,
and in many cases manipulation of the subject
matter by the photographers to fit into the ideological and aesthetic needs of both the artist and
Stryker. Evans, for example, frequently moved
or removed elements in composing his images of
rural workers’ homes to fit into his Purist aesthetic
sensibilities. Lange, when photographing her
most famous image, Migrant Mother, took several
shots until she had composed her subjects to
resemble a Madonna with child image, one
where the woman’s plight would appeal to the sensibilities of educated urban viewers of the image.
By the time Robert Frank began The Americans,
his documentary of the United States published
in 1959, he acknowledged personal expression as
part of his project.
In Europe, the socially concerned photography
of Eugene Atget, August Sander, and Bill Brandt
was grounded in class realism. Susan Sontag,
in her book On Photography (1973), identifies

photography

538
The beginnings of postmodern thought in
art can be traced to Structuralism and Poststructuralism, particularly in the writings of
Barthes, Derrida, Foucault and Lévi-Strauss.
These writers think of culture as a corpus of
codes or myths. The writings of Roland Barthes
are of particular importance to photography and
to the development of a “theory of photography.”
In his 1961 essay “The photographic message,”
Barthes examines a particular “type” of photograph, the press photograph. Barthes first identifies
a concept crucial to understanding photography
as a cultural product. The source of meaning
in all photographs is based upon their “use,”
upon their context. He emphasizes that his project is one that is an analysis of codes versus
signifieds, an examination of the cultural versus
the literal message of the press photograph. It is
in this essay, and in “Rhetoric of the image,” that
Barthes identifies “the photographic paradox,”
which he describes as the coexistence of two
messages, one neutral (natural, “denoted”) and
the other invested (cultural, “connoted”) (see
Connotation/denotation). Barthes also
applies his literary notion of Intertextuality
to images, identifying images as “polysemous”
entities that have underlying them a “floating
chain of signifieds” (Barthes, 1961).
Barthes concludes that “pure denotation” in
the photograph can only exist on the level of the
traumatic image. In line with notions of the
trauma in Freudian and, later, Lacanian psychoanalysis, Barthes describes the trauma as a suspension or blockage of meaning. Twenty years later,
in Camera Lucida (1980), Barthes retains the idea
of the traumatic image, while transforming his earlier terms “denotation” and “connotation” into
the terms “punctum” and “studium.” In this, his
last book, Barthes dispensed with the methodologies of psychoanalysis and instead utilized
ideas drawn from phenomenology, a move that
Victor Burgin in his 1986 essay “Re-reading
Camera Lucida” describes as having severe consequences for the development of photography
theory. Heavily influenced by the writings of
Barthes, but with an eye towards further developing a link to Lacanian psychoanalytic theory,
Burgin in this essay locates the persistent operation of the unconscious in Barthes’s discussions
of the “punctum” in connection with particular photographs. The “punctum,” formerly the

denotative, now aligns with the Lacanian real, the
unsymbolizable, the “plenitude which is effaced
in the very moment it is experienced” (Burgin,
1986a).
Rosalind Krauss has also been highly influential in developing a theory for the medium.
Krauss, like Burgin, has utilized Lacanian theories of the unconscious in several books and
essays that have appeared in the journal October
on photography and art. In her re-examination
of Surrealism and photography’s place in it, she
positions photography as a radical critique of
representation. Like Barthes, Krauss examines
the photograph as a contingent message, although
Krauss’s focus is primarily on art photography.
In attempting to find a discourse proper to the
medium, Krauss concludes, in “A note on photography and the simulacral,” which refers to
ideas drawn from both Benjamin and Foucault,
that photography itself is a project of Deconstruction in which art is distanced and separated
from itself (Krauss, 1984).
New currents in the art world in the late 1970s
placed photography at the center of critiques of
representation. Andy Grundberg in his essays
on interactions between art and photography
locates the source of the increased appearance
of photography in the mainstream art world in
Conceptual Art, where the idea is of primary
importance in a work of art. This turn to photography by Conceptual Artists in the late
1960s and 1970s springs from the quintessential
modernist desire to produce art that subverts
traditional notions of what art is. Artists such as
Bruce Nauman and Douglas Huebler initially
turned to photography as a means of documenting their performances. John Baldessari and
Robert Cumming dismantled the “truth” effect of
the photograph in their exploration of notions
about perception by creating explicitly false illusions for the camera. A precursor for this use of
the photograph was Yves Klein’s “The Leap” of
1960, a photograph of the artist diving out of a
second-story window. The photograph was a
fake and yet it presents the event as if it were real.
Hans Haacke used photography specifically
for its objectivity in a series of works, which
sought to undermine the separation of the art
world from political realities, by exposing the
connections between the art world, wealth, and
social inequities. His work and the work of other

539
tographed “masterpieces.” In rephotographing
and presenting as her own such works as
Weston’s famous Torso of Neil, she drew attention to the imaginary boundary between high
art photography and other diverse uses of the
medium, as well as undermining notions of
authenticity and authorship. However, postmodernism in art as a critical enterprise is itself
problematic, for although much of this work
takes a critical stance towards the marketplace, it
attempts its critique within that same marketplace.
Richard Bolton in the introduction to his
anthology The Contest of Meaning calls for a
stronger alliance between the production of art
and its theory; in particular he calls for a radical
repoliticization of photography and art. The
project addressed in this collection of essays,
including writing by both historians and practitioners, such as Douglas Crimp, Deborah Bright,
Martha Rosler, and Abigail Solomon-Godeau,
is the rewriting of a history of the medium that
recognizes its social embeddedness in cultural
productions of many types besides art.
In his book Techniques of the Observer,
Johnathon Crary developed a new Paradigm
for thinking about photography in the context
of Western perspectivalism, rejecting the linear
narrative of technical progression that leads
from the camera obscura to photography. Crary
locates a theoretical rupture in the early nineteenth
century, which shifts from a geometrical optics to
a physiological account of vision. Former historical accounts of photography have consistently
placed the camera obscura as the model for the
present day camera, but Crary’s arguments dismantle this line of thinking. Crary continues his
historical study of ideas about vision in subsequent
books, turning towards the subject of attention
and its role in the modernization of subjectivity.
The development of digital imaging technologies, beginning with military uses in the 1960s
and entering professional and consumer photography in the late 1980s, greatly impacted thinking and writing about photography beginning
in the early 1990s. For some theorists, such as
William J. Mitchell in his book The Re-Configured
Eye: Visual Truth in the Post-Photographic Era, and
photojournalist Fred Ritchin, digital technologies
heralded the death of traditional photography,
due to a perceived rupturing of the link between
image and reality. Other theorists, such as Martin

photography

conceptual artists sought to dematerialize art
and to subvert its consumption. The use of the
infinitely reproducible photograph fit into this aim.
The Conceptualist influence also reached more
traditional areas of art photography, influencing the work of many artists, including Duane
Michals, Lewis Baltz, and Lucas Samaras. In John
Pfahl’s “Altered Landscapes,” the artist overtly
manipulated traditionally sublime landscape
views, questioning the veracity of the photograph as a document while poking fun at the work
of such modern masters as Ansel Adams. Robert
Heinecken’s contact printed magazine pages produced a series of multilayered, tonally reversed
images and were a precursor to the imageappropriations of Richard Prince in the 1980s.
These new currents in the use of photography
reveal a fundamental shift in the medium’s
identity. While photography reached its goal of
being accepted as a modernist art form, the
terms of this goal, the purity and autonomy
of photography as a medium, were no longer
relevant concerns in the art world. Ironically,
all the increased attention to the medium has in
turn increased its market value in the art world.
Photography’s centrality has meant it is no
longer the “outsider” of the art world that it
once was thought to be.
In the 1980s the art world increasingly turned
towards photography as a way to re-access the
social and in turn as a means to reinvigorate
art. Photography in most of this work serves as
a vehicle for critique. This is evident in the work
of such artists as Barbara Kruger, Louise Lawler,
and Richard Prince. The early work of Cindy
Sherman accesses the look of Hollywood film
stills, as a means to expose the ideology that
operates in them. In her “Untitled Film Stills,” the
artist poses herself in stereotypical passive rolls,
questioning at once conventions of film noir,
sexual identity, and the “self-portrait.” Richard
Prince in a sense realized the end of the modernist
project in a refusal to make art. His work as an
artist comprised mostly the choosing, arranging,
and rephotographing of magazine photographs,
utilizing the already “full” world of images as his
source. As a result, his work unmasks the syntax
of editorial and advertising photography. Sherrie
Levine, too, drew upon already existing images
but instead turned to the world of modernist
photography itself as a source for her repho-

Lister, Sarah Kember, and Lev Manovich, see
this line of thinking as flawed in the way it
reduces photography to simply an image-making
technology, ignoring the wider social and cultural
contexts in which photographs exist and come
to have meaning. Indeed, it seems the specter of
old debates about the straight versus pictorialist
modes that preoccupied theorists at the turn of
the twentieth century re-emerged with renewed
vigor in the face of digital technologies. In this
debate, these two modalities are simply transferred
to a new dialectic: the “realist” or straight position aligning with traditional photography and the
“constructivist” or pictorialist position aligning
with the digital (Lister, 1995). As Kember points
out, these debates mask a larger crisis over the
potential loss of our psychological and social investments in the photographic real (Kember, 1996).
For Manovich, the concept of the photographic
real re-emerges in the digital, in the practice
of adding “noise” to 3D modeled characters in
mainstream films to make them fit better with our
conceptions of the real as aligned with the photographic reproduction of it (Manovich, 1994).
It is widely accepted that digital technologies
have made it easier and faster to alter and disseminate photographic images, but many theorists
see a historical lineage between such things as
photomontage of the early twentieth century and
the “electrobricollage” (Mitchell, 1992) made
easy with such programs as Adobe Photoshop.
Photohistorian Geoffrey Batchen finds links at the
very origins of photography to the proto-computer
inventions of Charles Babbage in the nineteenth
century. To Batchen, a more significant battle
was being waged in the realm of “photo-as-data”
(Batchen, 2001), with the purchasing in 1996
by the Bill Gates-owned Corbis Corporation of
the electronic reproduction rights of millions
of photographic images, including reproduction
rights for the work of Ansel Adams. Batchen
points towards potential issues with control and
access to this vast archive (what will be digitized
and what therefore will be available to the public)
as it impacts the writing of history.
Writings on the impact of electronic technologies upon photography formed the foundation
for a number of new media theorists writing
about the cultural landscapes opened by cyberspace and electronic media, including Donna

Haraway, Alluquerc Rosanne Stone, Timothy
Druckery, and Peter Lunenfeld. With their ability to simulate any type of image, digital imaging
technologies have blurred former distinctions
between media for still and moving images,
audio, and animation.
Photography has been at the center of traumatic events since its inception, and in the
aftermath of the tragic events of September 11,
2001, photographs played a central role. Images
of missing loved ones appeared in makeshift
shrines throughout New York, and were eventually published by the New York Times. Writer
David Levi Strauss observed in his essay “The highest degree of illusion” the need for people to
repeatedly view these photographs in the weeks
following this tragedy, providing just enough
distance to “make it real” (Strauss, 2003).
The subsequent US involvement in conflicts in
Afghanistan and Iraq brought to the surface a
number of politically contentious debates about
photographic images. In 1991, the first Bush
administration instituted a ban on publishing
images showing the remains of soldiers returning
from military conflicts during the Gulf War. In
2008, The New York Times drew attention to this
ban, suggesting that it hid the true costs of
the wars from the public eye. The Pentagon
announced a lifting of this ban in February 2009,
primarily allowing images of flag-draped coffins
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan at Dover
Airforce Base to be published. The wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan also changed the open access
photojournalists had in previous wars, with the
practice of embedding journalists within particular military units.
A flurry of writings and exhibitions surfaced
after the release in 2004 of a series of images portraying the abuse of prisoners in the Abu Ghraib
prison in Iraq. The images, which were first
circulated via the Internet and later published in
The New Yorker magazine on May 10, 2004,
demonstrate an important shift in the use of
photographs, as Susan Sontag wrote in her last
published writing on photography, Regarding
the Pain of Others (Sontag, 2004), to their being
“less objects to be saved than messages to be
disseminated.” Sontag argues the Abu Ghraib
photographs themselves were part and parcel of
the torture itself, enhancing the humiliation

`Piaget, Jean (1896–1980) 
Major Swiss
structuralist thinker in the fields of psychology and
epistemology. From the outset of his career, he
was interested in studying how intellectual structures are established in the human being. This was
to be his key to the way in which knowledge is
acquired. The result was that he spent a great deal
of his time on the development of intelligence
during childhood.
For Piaget, human beings construct solutions
which, if they work, are necessarily linked structurally with the laws of the human mind and,
ultimately, natural laws. On a broader scale, he
moves from this position to a theorizing of the
growth of an individual’s reasoning faculties in
relation to a progression of human understanding in general. Since the individual’s intelligence
and the intelligence of the human race in general
are ultimately derived from one and the same
structure, that of the biological human being,
the relation between the two is one of mutually
verifiable complicity. This theory is the root of his
concern with psychology, and links it with his
concern with epistemology. For Piaget, the relation between the two is of such importance that
he cannot simply study one or the other; he
must pay attention to both, in tandem.
In keeping with his structuralist method,
Piaget concentrated on the relations between
elements. Thus he looked at the growth of individual reasoning in and through its relationship
with the world exterior to the individual. In
order to do this, he developed a Metalanguage
based upon slightly modified vocabulary and
symbolic logic. For example, the term “schema”
is his term for an organized set of actions, such
that if a child learns to reach for one thing, it can
apply that experience to reaching for another. The
child may do this without being able to explain
how it arrived at its conclusion, and this is where
intuition plays a part. However, this intuition is
not a mysterious phenomenon: it is the result
of the very structure of learning rooted in the
human brain. Ultimately, the development of
adult intelligence is the result of a move from
such purely physical actions to an ability to solve
problems by thought alone. Thus, for Piaget,
thoughts were once actions, and it is this theoretical position which underpins his developmental
psychology. It is the way that the biological

already taking place before the camera. Sontag, as
well as art historian Stephen Eisenman in his
book The Abu Ghraib Effect, analyzed the images,
finding in them echoes of amateur pornography, lynching photographs, and classical art.
Eisenman’s analysis concludes that the images
are part of a well established artistic tradition in
displays of complicity in torture and murder
(Eisenman, 2007). In 2008, an article about the
indicted soldier who took most of the images complicated some of these analyses, concluding that
the images were more a means of documenting
“what was happening there and what was allowed
to be done” (Specialist Sabrina Harman, as
quoted in Gourevitch and Morris, 2008). Errol
Morris’s documentary film Standard Operating
Procedure (Morris, 2008) examines the context in
which these images were made and sheds light
on the chain of command that allowed the abuse
to occur. The photographs also inspired dozens
of books to be published and formed the center
of a wider discussion on torture.

organism is structured which permits the individual’s adaptive intelligence to develop. The
stages of this development, however, are problematical, since the way in which the intellect is
structured varies depending on the age of the child.
The way in which the move from one stage to the
next is managed is not clear, and Piaget’s term for
this gap is “décalage.”
It is clear that for Piaget the development of
reasoning is structured as a relation of differences
between one stage and the others, and this
is what marks him as a major exponent of
Structuralism. Moreover, he uses a version of
structural linguistics similar to that of Ferdinand
de Saussure as the basis for his theory of the
child’s realization of the operation of signification.
For Piaget, there is a fundamental difference
between the signifier and the significate (his
equivalent of Saussure’s signified), and this difference is predicated upon the essential structure
of representation as it is present in the human
mind. As it develops, the child changes the mode
of its signifying operation from Symbol to the
sociably shared Sign.
Accordingly, Piaget’s developmental psychology
provides him with a basis for attempting to deal
with the wider issues of signification and epistemology. In effect, he sees the emergence of the
intellect as a natural operation which, although
influenced by language and Culture, is in fact
separate from them. For Piaget, this operation
is the fundamental process of signification and
epistemology itself, whether mathematical, logical,
or psychological. All are rooted ultimately in the
structure of the human mind. When he attempts
to deal with the problem of the contribution of
unconscious impulses to creativity, he derives
from his theory the concept of a relational distinction between unconscious and conscious
work, rather than an absolute one. By paying
attention to the structure of learning itself, he
side-steps the problem of the relative inaccessibility of the Unconscious. His position that the
intellect is structured in the way he describes
allows him to invoke that structure as somehow
prior even to the unconscious, a maneuver familiar from other structuralist usages of a kind of
“deep structure.” The neurological structure of the
human brain overdetermines the development
of the intellect, and thus is also what lies behind
the movements in epistemology. For Piaget,

therefore, the history of epistemology is a single
huge developmental process. This recalls similar
claims on the part of structuralist literary critics
such as Gérard Genette and other proponents
of Narratology for a literary tradition. It also
raises similar problems, because it entails the
production of a monological structure which is
an attempt to account for all human activity in
the field. It marginalizes the possibility of positions which challenge the integrity of the overall
conception. In Piaget’s theory, the movement
from developmental psychology to epistemology
is therefore the direct equivalent of the process
of Naturalization which takes place in structuralist literary studies. Any interrogation of
the order he produces can be recuperated by
recourse to the inherent biologism of his model.
Ultimately, any powerful challenge to his theory
would require an interrogation of the way he
reduces intellect to the human neurological network, as a kind of biological humanism similar
to that employed by Claude Lévi-Strauss in
his work on myths. It is, however, possible to
avoid even this necessity, by concentrating on the
historically precise characteristics of different
epistemologies. Thus Michel Foucault utilizes
the concept of the epistemological break to call
into question any straightforward narrative of
epistemology along the lines assumed by Piaget.
A radically historicizing maneuver of this kind
would pay more attention to the possibilities
opened up by Piaget to the discontinuities he
uncovered in the child’s development, as they apply
to epistemology itself in his model.

`poetry 
“Some people,” as Northrop Frye
writes pithily, “believe that literary terms can be
defined.” With similar caveats, various authors,
having attempted to establish the meaning of
poetry, have admitted that such an enterprise
is “dangerous,” “impossible,” or “meaningless,”
given the wide and loose range of the application
of the term. And, to make matters worse, since
Goethe, Poe, Wordsworth, and Coleridge, poetry
has been construed or misconstrued as synonymous with the lyric – so much so that today, as
Virginia Jackson points out, the lyricization of
poetry since the Romantics has both idealized it
and made it socially marginal.
Most explicators of the term poetry thus lead
us back to its etymology, explaining that in the
original Greek, poetry refers simply to something
made, whether in verse or not (see, for example,
Fowler and Rodway, A Dictionary of Modern
Critical Terms). One may value such an activity
of making as either inferior, as Plato did, or
superior, as the Romantics did, to a given reality. Implicit in such a polarity are the two major
poetic theories: poetry as imitation (mimesis),
which gave rise mainly but not exclusively to
epic and dramatic poetry and which remained
unchallenged through the eighteenth century;
and poetry as creation, which brought to
unprecedented significance the lyric. Before the
Romantic revolution, poetry as mimesis was
mainly employed to interpret a given reality
and, as Horace and later Sir Philip Sidney and
Samuel Johnson had demanded, to delight and to
instruct the audience. However, as M.H. Abrams
has noted, Aristotle’s unprecedented minute

attention to the forms of poetry, independent
from its mimetic reference, implies that poetry,
even in Aristotle’s mimetic theory, acquired an
implicit aesthetic autonomy with no other criteria than its own form and internal structure.
While, for Aristotle, the historian “describes the
thing that has been,” the poet imagines “a kind
of thing that might be. Hence poetry,” he continues, “is something more philosophic and of
graver import than history, since its statements
are of the nature rather of universals.” Such a privileging of poetry over history, and of aesthetics
over nature, is reflected also in Aristotle’s
Physics, where he points out that “art in some cases
completes what nature cannot bring to a finish.”
While Sidney’s notion that “poetry does not
depend on nature but creates a second nature
of its own” is not a radical departure from
Aristotle, Sidney sees in the “peerless poet” an ideal
mixture of the philosopher and the historian:
“he coupleth the general notion with the particular example.” Such a definition of the poet
permits Sidney not only to call into question
the authority of philosophical and historical
discourse, but to liberate poetry from the philosopher’s and the historian’s alleged rhetorical
self-deceptions and to bestow upon the poet the
unique privilege of self-conscious fictionality:
“though he recount things not true, yet because
he telleth them not for true, he lieth not.”
The controversy over the nature of poetic
truth presupposes, as it does in Sidney’s Defense,
a mimetic standard. Once that standard was
abandoned in the mid-nineteenth century, as
Christopher Clausen has pointed out, Wordsworth’s “great truths” eventually became Frost’s
“clarification of life – not necessarily a great
clarification such as sects and cults are founded
on, but . . . a momentary stay against confusion.”
Poetic truth becomes “dramatic truth” (Cleanth
Brooks), poetic statements become “pseudo
statements” (I.A. Richards). And finally, in
Archibald MacLeish’s phrase, “A poem should
not mean / But be,” which echoes Mallarmé’s
laconic point that poems are not made out of ideas,
but out of words – what these words mean is not
a matter of reference but of rhetoric.
When Wordsworth in his Preface to the second
edition of Lyrical Ballads (1802) famously declared that poetry is “the spontaneous overflow of
powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion

poetry

as Deconstruction and Foucault as Genealogy. It has been observed by Christopher
Norris, among others, that when Derrida’s
writing becomes too playful he has (perhaps
unwittingly) invited the mistaken judgment that
he has abandoned entirely the seriousness of
truth and political engagement.

544
recollected in tranquility,” the epistemological
basis of poetry shifted to an unverifiable inward
subjectivity. “The paramount cause of poetry,” as
Abrams usefully adds, “is not, as in Aristotle,
a formal cause, determined primarily by the
human actions and qualities imitated; nor as in
neo-classical criticism, a final cause, the effect
intended upon an audience; but instead an
efficient cause – the impulse within the poet of
feelings and desires seeking expression, or the
compulsion of the ‘creative’ imagination.” The rise
of the lyric initiated by the Romantic movement thus generated such highly problematic
notions as “genius,” “originality,” “immediacy,”
“presence,” “aesthetic autonomy,” and “transcendence.” Although the lyrical poem is by no
means an invention of the Romantics (Spenser,
Shakespeare, or Milton were great lyric poets as
well of course; indeed, James William Johnson
traces the genre back to prehistoric Rituals),
it becomes thereafter the vehicle for expressions
of an existential situation markedly different
from the social experiences hitherto rendered by
satires, epics, odes, ballads, or pastorals (with
sonnets as perhaps a liminal form). While previously a theme or subject was given, and then
mimetically transformed into a particular verse
form, often for public performance, the Romantic
and Post-Romantic lyric is by comparison a
solitary monologue. The creator of such monologues is perhaps most famously characterized by
Shelley as “a nightingale who sits in darkness
and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet
sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the
melody of an unseen musician.” This conception
of the poet as solitary singer – overheard rather
than heard – has survived, with important shifts
of emphasis, in, for example, the French symbolists
and their various successors, the modernists, the
confessional poets, and the deep imagists.
The concept of the autonomous lyrical poem
goes back to Kant’s aesthetic, which assigns the
work of art no cognitive value but (merely) a purposeful purposelessness. Thus, Auden could say
that “poetry makes nothing happen” even if it is
precisely this non-utilitarian, ahistoric, atemporal
quality that assures poetry that “it survives / In
the valley of its making where executives /
Would never want to tamper.” Auden’s expulsion
of the executives from the valley of poetry
responds wittily to Plato’s expulsion of the poets

from his republic, where Plato had darkly warned
that poetry “endangers the whole system.” Indeed,
through Poe’s influence on the French symbolists, the poem became a self-referential order of
words, or of mental correspondences, un forêt
des symboles, as Rimbaud later called it, in which
one might get lost. Accordingly, when Eliot
writes in “Little Gidding” that “prayer is more /
than an order of words,” it is likely that he
sought a way precisely to transcend the solipsistic aestheticism and enigmatic inwardness of the
symbolist poem.
Plato’s warning is of course not a warning
against harmless illusions, but perhaps against
the kinds of implications inherent in the political autonomy of art, or in the self-absorbed
intensity of such poetic tableaux as Frost’s stopping by woods on a snowy evening (1923). The
traveler of Frost’s poem appears to be initially
undertaking the same journey that Northrop
Frye thinks of when he defines poetry as a ritual
turning away “from our ordinary continuous
experience in space and time, or . . . from the
verbal mimesis of it.” Examples to illustrate this
creative aversion, as Frye points out, may extend
beyond the subjective lyric to such varied forms
of poetry as the meditative Old Testament Psalms,
the dramatic monologues of Byron’s Childe
Harold, or the lyrical narrative of Wordsworth’s
Prelude. The short, intense, subjective lyric, however, as Frye claims, “superimposes a different kind
of experience” on the narrative rhythms of time
and of life. The implications of a definition of
poetry as opposing the constructions of meaning
through narrative intimates therefore the radical
otherness of poetry, its structurally, aesthetically,
politically disruptive qualities. The French symbolist poets, and their modernist successors,
both European and American, thus demand of
the poem a refusal to translate into the terms of
prose and paraphrase, or what these terms signify,
into the narratives of historical existence. The
symbolist, the modernist, or the aesthetic tradition that has given rise to and derived from these
forms of poetry would thus find the purest
expression of poetry in a “release,” as Denis
Donoghue has proposed, of language “from
the office of representation into the mercy of
fictiveness.” Donoghue suggests that we find such
fortunate instances in images “of pure presentation” that demand of the reader consequently

545

Whereas the symbol postulates the possibility
of an identity or identification, allegory designates primarily a distance in relation to its own
origin, and, renouncing the nostalgia and the
desire to coincide, it establishes its language
in the void of this temporal difference. In so
doing it prevents the self from an illusory
identification with the non-self, which is now fully,
though painfully, recognized as the non-self.

Such a theory, echoing as it does the existentialist’s fear of bad faith, is indebted to a materialist

or historicist mode of thinking, one that prohibits
any transcendence of material circumstances
through symbol, metaphor, or art. A similar
impulse underlies more recent theorizing of the
lyric. Jackson, for example, historicizes our construction of the relationship between poetry and
the lyric, and our consequent expectations of
each. She cautions that if we conceive of the lyric
as a timeless idealization, we at once overburden
its potential and erase its social relevance.
Virgina Woolf has reminded us that fiction is
“like a spider’s web, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.”
Nevertheless, given poetry’s abandonment of
mimetic or referential obligations, these attachments would have to be established in other,
perhaps more tenuous, ways: first perhaps in the
allowance that the poem may indeed resist to
be attached at all, with all the attendant political
and historical implications of poetry’s potential
irrelevance, and second in the admission of the
necessity, nevertheless, of such attachments.
Unlike music, words are inevitably referential,
taking their meanings, rebellious or not, from the
daily conventions of language, and that may
account for the tensions within which poetry
must define itself. Unlike music, which needs no
apology, poetry is inextricably associated with
the history of its defenses, and thus with the history of criticism and literary theory. Intersecting
with its endless critiques and defenses in theory
and criticism, while yet standing on the brink
of silence and music, poetry seeks manifold
interdisciplinary connections but complicates all
forms of appropriation.

disinterested acts of pure perception. But one
may wonder if such acts either of reception or
representation are possible.
Even if poetry is nothing but an order of
words, it is, like all artistic creation, necessarily
occasioned and contextualized by psychological
and historical realities. “Mad Ireland,” as Auden
writes, “hurt [Yeats] into poetry.” Baudelaire’s
fleurs du mal reflect nineteenth-century social
distress and personal affliction. If the romantic
conception of the poem is that of the symbol,
famously defined by Coleridge as “partak[ing] of
the Reality which it renders intelligible,” more
recent theories, especially Deconstruction and
various theories of race, Gender, class, and sexual orientation, have stressed the impossibility
of, and necessary self-mystifications attending,
such aesthetic transcendence of time and history. From a so-called demystified perspective, one
would allow poetry an aesthetic respite from the
world “if and only if one is attempting to follow
an imperative not to stop there,” as Barbara
Johnson puts it. Her imperative takes its authority from a rejection of an aesthetic solipsism, a
wistful stopping by woods on snowy evenings or
upon Westminster bridges, because these inward
forms of otherness permit an idealization and neutralization of an intrinsic otherness that would
amount to a synthesis of what always remains, and
should remain, Johnson insists, an unbridgeable
difference within. Such an irreparable difference,
by which every poem remains self-divided and
polyphonic rather than homogeneous, duplicitous
rather than self-identical, has sometimes led to a
preference of allegory over symbol. If Coleridge
dismissed allegory as “empty echoes which the
fancy arbitrarily associates with the apparitions
of matter,” Paul De Man inverts Coleridge’s
preference of the symbol over allegory:

`politics and original sin 
The return to religion has become perhaps the dominant cliché
of contemporary theory. Of course, theory often
offers nothing more than an exaggerated echo of
what is happening in reality, a political reality dominated by the fact of religious war. Somehow we
seem to have passed from a secular age, which we
were ceaselessly told was post-metaphysical, to
a new situation where political action seems to
flow directly from metaphysical conflict. This
situation can be triangulated around the often fatal
entanglement of politics and religion, where the
third vertex of the triangle is violence. Politics,
religion, and violence appear to define the present through which we are all too precipitously
moving, the phenomenon of sacred political
violence, where religiously justified violence is
the means to a political end. The question of
community, of human being together, has to be
framed – for good or ill – in terms of this triangulation of politics, religion, and violence. In
this essay, I want to look at one way, admittedly
a highly peculiar and contentious way, in which
the question of community was posed historically and might still be posed. This is what I
want to call “mystical anarchism.” However, I want
to begin somewhere else, to be precise with
two political theories at the very antipodes of
anarchism.
Carl Schmitt: The Political, Dictatorship and the
Belief in Original Sin Let us return to that return
to religion. Perhaps no thinker has enjoyed more
popularity in the past years and seemed more germane than Carl Schmitt. The reasons for this are
complex. In his Political Theology, he famously
writes, “All significant concepts in the modern
theory of the state are secularized theological
concepts.” This is true not just historically,
Schmitt insists, but systematically and conceptually. The omnipotent God of medieval
Christianity becomes the omnipotent monarch,
for example in Hobbes’s Leviathan. Until the
late seventeenth century, the general will was a
theological term of art that referred to the will of

God. By 1762, in Rousseau’s Social Contract,
the general will had been transformed into the will
of the people and the question of sovereignty
was transposed from the divine to the civic. Of
course, this entails that the will of the people is
always virtuous and those who oppose it can be
legitimately exterminated as evil. The politicization of theological concepts leads ineluctably to
the attempt to purify virtue through violence,
which is the political sequence that begins
with French Jacobinism in 1792 and continues
through to the dreadful violent excesses of
twentieth-century politics that we can summarize
with the proper names of Lenin, Stalin, and
Hitler, then through to what some might call
the “Islamo-Leninism” or “Islamo-Jacobinism” of
al-Qaeda and related groups.
But such an argument does not exonerate socalled liberal democracy. On the contrary, Schmitt
views the triumph of the liberal-constitutional state
as the triumph of deism, a theological vision that
unifies reason and nature by identifying the latter with divinity. As can be seen most obviously
in the deism of the Founding Fathers, American
democracy is a peculiar confection of Roman
republicanism and puritanical providentialism,
enshrined in John Winthrop’s sermon about
the “Citty [sic] on the Hill” (which Sarah Palin
ascribed to Ronald Reagan), the upbuilding of
the “New England.” At the core of American
democracy is a civil religion that functions as a
powerful sustaining myth and buttresses the idea
of manifest destiny. Barack Obama’s political
genius was to have reconnected classical liberal
constitutionalism with a motivating civil religion
focused around the idea of belief and a faith
in change and progress.
Schmitt’s problem with Liberalism is that it
is anti-political. What this means is that for the
liberal every political decision must be rooted in
a norm whose ultimate justification flows from
the constitution. Within liberalism, political
decisions are derived from constitutional norms
and higher than the state stands the law and the
interpretation of the law. This is why the highest
political authority in a liberal state rests with the
supreme court or its equivalent. Political action
is subordinated to juridical interpretation. For
Schmitt, a truly political decision is what breaks
with any norm, frees itself from any normative ties,
and becomes absolute. This is why the question

547
perhaps, they are not friends that Schmitt would
have chosen. He was much happier in the company of Catholic counter-revolutionaries like
Joseph de Maistre and Donoso Cortés. What
has to be grasped is that Schmitt’s argument for
the state of exception as exemplifying the operation of the political is also an argument for
dictatorship. If the subject of sovereignty is
revealed in the decision on the state of exception,
then this decision is the act where the constitution is suspended and dictatorship is introduced.
Dictatorship, then, is justified when there is an
actual or imagined danger to the existence of the
state. Roman republicanism explicitly allowed
for this possibility and one might ponder as to
the conceivability of republicanism as a political form without the possibility of recourse to
dictatorship. The condition of possibility for
legality and legitimacy is the political act that
suspends it.
Obama writes in The Audacity of Hope that
“Democracy is not a house to be built, it is a conversation to be had.” At the core of Obama’s
liberal civil religion is a resolute defense of the
primacy of the constitution, an absolute conviction that all political decisions have to be
derived from norms, and that the procedure for
decision-making is deliberation. It’s enough
to make Habermas burst into a break dance.
However, Schmitt would be turning in his grave.
For him, the idea of everlasting conversation is
a gruesomely comic fantasy. If liberals were presented with the question “Christ or Barabas?”
they would move to adjourn the proceedings
and establish a commission of investigation or a
special committee of inquiry that would report
back some time the following year. Within liberalism, everything becomes everlasting discussion, the glorious conversation of humankind, the
sphere of what Schmitt calls with a sneer “culture.”
Such a culture floats like foam over the socioeconomic reality of the liberal state, which
Schmitt, following his teacher Weber, compares
to a huge industrial plant dominated by capitalism and scientism and incapable of political
action. For Catholic counter-revolutionaries,
like Donoso Cortés, faced with the hegemony of
a depoliticized liberalism powerless in the face
of a capitalist economy, the only solution was
dictatorship. Faced with the toothless liberal constitutionalism of Weimar Germany in the 1920s

politics and original sin

of the state of exception is of such importance to
Schmitt. The state of exception is that moment
of radical decision where the operation of the
law is suspended. This is what the Romans called
iusticium, which Agamben has written about
compellingly. What the decision on the state
of exception reveals is the true subject of political sovereignty. Schmitt famously writes that
“Sovereign is who decides on the state of
exception” (“Soverän ist, wer über den Ausnahmezustand entscheidet”). That is, the sovereign
is the person who is exhibited by the decision on
the state of exception. The question “who?” is
answered by the decision itself. That is, the decision on the state of exception, the moment of
the suspension of the operation of law, brings the
subject “who?” into being. To put it into a slogan,
the subject is the consequence of a decision. The
subject that is revealed by the decision on the state
of exception is the state and the core of Schmitt’s
theory of the political is to show that the true
subject of political is the state and that the state
must always stand higher than the law.
Schmitt makes the fascinating remark that the
concept of the state of exception is the jurisprudential analogue to the concept of the miracle in
theology. The triumph of liberalism as the triumph
of deism is the hegemony of a religious view of
the world that tries to banish the miracle, as that
which would break with the legal-constitutional
situation, the order of what Badiou calls the
event, and which he compares with a miracle.
Liberal constitutionalists like Locke or Kant, or
neo-Kantians like Kelsen, seek to eliminate the state
of exception and subject everything to the rule
of law, which is the rule of the rule itself, namely
reason. Schmitt criticizes the rationalism of liberalism in the name of what he calls – and here
we find echoes of Dilthey in Schmitt that will
resound further in the young Heidegger – a
philosophy of concrete life. Such an existential
approach embraces the exception and breaks
with the rule and the rule of the rule. Schmitt
writes, thinking explicitly of Kierkegaard: “In the
exception the power of real life breaks through
the crust of a mechanism that has become torpid
through repetition.”
It is not difficult to see why Schmitt’s existential politics of passion and concrete life and his
critique of liberal democracy should have won him
many friends on the left, like Chantal Mouffe. Sadly

and the fact of economic collapse, it is not
difficult to understand the appeal the argument
for dictatorship had for Schmitt with the rise of
the National Socialists. The only way to restore
the true subject of the political, namely the state,
was the suspension of the constitution and the
decision to declare a state of exception.
The political theology of liberalism is the pervasiveness of a weak deistic God. The liberal, like
Obama, wants God, but one that is not active
in the world. He wants a God that permits no
enthusiasm and who never contradicts or overrides the rule of reason and law. That way, it is
assumed, leads to the prophetic radicalism of
Jeremiah Wright. In short, liberals want a God that
cannot perform miracles. Against this, Schmitt
wants to revivify the political by restoring the state
of exception and the possibility of the miracle. But,
as Schmitt makes crystal clear, this requires a
belief in original sin.
For Schmitt, every conception of the political
takes a position on human nature. It requires some
sort of anthropological commitment: human
beings are either naturally good or evil. Schmitt
thinks – and I agree – that this leads to the two
most pervasive political alternatives to liberalism: authoritarianism and anarchism. Anarchists
believe in the essential goodness of the human
being. Their progenitor is Rousseau and his
belief that wickedness is the historical outcome
of the development of society towards greater
levels of inequality. By contrast, on this view,
political legitimacy can be achieved by what
Rousseau frequently referred to as “a change in
nature,” from wickedness to goodness, of the
kind imagined in The Social Contract. Although
this is a caricature of Rousseau and he could in
no way be described as an anarchist, this view is
more accurately developed by Bakunin: namely
that if human beings are essentially good, then
it is the mechanisms of the state, religion, law
and the police that make them bad. Once these
mechanisms have been removed and replaced
with autonomous self-governing communes in
a federative structure, then we will truly have
heaven on earth. We will come back to this view
below, but it is worth noting that arguments
for anarchism always turn on the idea that if
human beings are allowed to express what comes
naturally to them, if the force of life itself is not
repressed by the deathly force of the state, then

it will be possible to organize society on the basis
of mutual aid and cooperation.
By contrast, authoritarians believe that human
nature is essentially wicked. This is why the concept of original sin is so important politically.
For Donoso Cortés and de Maistre, human
beings were naturally depraved and essentially
vile. There is something essentially defective
in human nature that requires a corrective at the
political and theological level. It requires the
authority of the state and the church. Thus,
because the human being is defined by original
sin, authoritarianism, in the form of dictatorship
say, becomes necessary as the only means that
might save human beings from themselves.
Human beings require the hard rule of authority
because they are essentially defective. Against
this, anarchism is the political expression of
freedom from original sin – a sinless union
with others in the form of community is the
realization of the highest human possibility.
The idea of original sin is not some outdated
relic from the religious past. It is the conceptual
expression of a fundamental experience of
ontological defectiveness or lack that explains
the human propensity towards error, malice,
wickedness, violence, and extreme cruelty.
Furthermore, this defect is not something we
can put right, which is why authoritarians think
that human beings require the yoke of the state,
God, law, and the police. Politics becomes the
means for protecting human beings from themselves; that is, from their worst inclinations
towards lust, cruelty, and violence. As Hobbes
shows, any return to a state of nature is an argument in favor of the war of all against all. We
can find numerous post-Christian attempts to
rethink the concept of original sin. For example,
Freud advances the Schopenhauerian thesis
that there might simply be a disjunction between
eros and civilization, between the aggressive,
destructive workings of libidinous desire and
the achievements of culture. This disjunction is
only held in check through the internalized
authority of the superego. Again, Heidegger’s
ideas of thrownness, facticity, and falling were
explicitly elaborated in connection with Luther’s
conception or original sin and seek to explain
the endless human propensity towards evasion
and flight from taking responsibility for oneself.
Although such a responsibility can be momentarily

John Gray: The Naturalization of Original Sin,
Political Realism and Passive Nihilism The most
consequent contemporary defense of the idea of
original sin can be found in the work of John Gray.
What he gives us is a naturalized, Darwinian
redescription of original sin. To put it brutally,
human beings are killer apes. We are simply
animals, and rather nasty aggressive primates at
that, what Gray calls Homo rapiens, rapacious
hominids. Sadly, we are also killer apes with
metaphysical longing, which explains the ceaseless quest to find some meaning to life that
might be underwritten by an experience of the
holy or the numinous. Today’s dominant metaphysical dogma – and this is Gray’s real and
rightful target – is liberal humanism, with its
faith in progress, improvement, and the perfectibility of humankind, beliefs that are held with
the same unquestioning assurance with which
Christianity was held in Europe until the late
eighteenth century. As Gray makes clear, progress
in the realm of science is a fact. Furthermore, it
is a good. De Quincey famously remarked that
a quarter of human misery resulted from
toothache. The discovery of anaesthetic dentistry
is, thus, an unmixed good. However, although
progress is a fact, faith in progress is a superstition and the liberal humanist’s assurance in
the reality of human progress is the barely
secularized version of the Christian belief in
Providence.
The most extreme expression of human arrogance, for Gray, is the idea that human beings can
save the planet from environmental destruction.
Because they are killer apes – that is, by virtue
of a naturalized version of original sin that tends
them towards wickedness and violence – human
beings cannot save their planet. Furthermore,
the earth doesn’t need saving. This is where Gray
borrows from James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis.
The earth is suffering from a disseminated
primatemaia, a plague of people. Homo rapiens is
ravaging the planet like a filthy pest that has
infested a dilapidated but once beautiful mansion.
In 1600 the human population was about half
a billion. In the 1990s it increased by the same
amount. This plague cannot be solved by the

very species who are the efficient cause of the problem, but only by a large-scale decline in human
numbers, back down to manageable levels, say half
a billion or so. This is the wonderfully distopian
vision at the heart of Gray’s work: when the
earth is done with humans, it will recover and
human civilization will be forgotten. Life will
go on, but without us. Global warming is simply
one of many fevers that the earth has suffered
during its history. It will recover, but we won’t
because we can’t.
Gray writes, with Schmitt explicitly in mind,
“Modern politics is a chapter in the history of religion.” Politics has become a hideous surrogate for
religious salvation. Secularism, which denies the
truth of religion, is a religious myth. Specifically,
it is a myth of progress based in the idea that history has a providential design that is unfolding.
Now, such myths are important. They enable
presidents like Barack Obama to get elected.
But it doesn’t mean that they are true or even
salutary. What most disturbs Gray are utopian
political projects based on some apocalyptic
faith that concerted human action in the world
can allow for the realization of seemingly impossible ends and bring about the perfection
of humanity. Action cannot change the world
because we are the sort of beings that we are: killer
apes who will use violence, force, and terror at the
service of some longed-for metaphysical project.
For Gray, the core belief that drives utopianism,
on the right as much as the left, is the false
assumption that the world can be transformed by
human action and that history itself is progress
towards such a transformation. As Gray makes
explicit, his critique of utopianism derives in
large part from Norman Cohn’s hugely influential book, originally published in 1957, The
Pursuit of the Millennium.
It is Cohn’s analysis of millenarianism that is
so important for Gray. This is the idea that
salvation is not just a possibility, but a certainty
that will correspond to five criteria: salvation is
collective, terrestrial, imminent, total, and miraculous. In his later work, Cosmos, Chaos and the
World to Come, Cohn traced the roots of this
millenarian faith back to Zoroaster’s break with
the view that the world was the reflection of a
static cosmic order defined by cycle of conflict.
On the Zoroastrian view, some time between 1500
and 1200 bc, the world was moving, through

politics and original sin

achieved in authentic resoluteness, it can never
arrest the slide back into inauthenticity. The
concept of original sin is still very much with us.

incessant conflict, towards a conflictless state.
A time would come when, during a final bloody
battle, God and the forces of good would defeat
once and for all the armies of evil. Thus, a marvelous consummation is at hand, the moment
when good will triumph over evil and the agents
of evil will be annihilated. After that time, Cohn
writes, “The elect will thereafter live as a collectivity, unanimous and without conflict, on a
transformed and purified earth.”
This idea finds expression in certain Jewish
sects before finding its most powerful articulation in Christian ideas of the Apocalypse, the
Last Days and the Millennium. On the basis of
the authority of the Book of Revelation, it was
believed that after Christ’s Second Coming, he
would establish a kingdom of God on earth and
reign over it with his elect, the company of saints,
for a thousand years until the Last Judgment
and the general resurrection of the dead. Early
Christians, like St Paul, believed that the Second
Coming was imminent and that they were living
in the end times. The search for signs of the
Second Coming obviously took on enormous
importance. The key clue to the beginning of
the end times – and this is crucial – is the
appearance of the Antichrist: the prodigious,
evil, arch-enemy of God. The Antichrist is what
Ernesto Laclau would call a “floating signifier” in
millenarian political theology. He is endlessly
substitutable and can be personified as the great
Satan, the Pope, the Muslims, or the Jews.
What is crucial here is the identification of the
Antichrist as the incarnation of evil that presages
the reappearance of Christ or a similarly messianic
figure and leads to a bloody and violent terrestrial combat to build heaven on earth. This,
of course, is the deep logic of the Crusades,
which began with Pope Urban II’s plea to the
Church council of 1095 to go to Jerusalem and,
in his words, “liberate the Church of God.”
This lead directly to the “People’s Crusade” or
the “Peasants’ Crusade” in 1096–7 and to the
formation of a Christian fighting force in Asia
Minor that was between 50,000 and 70,000
strong. It is a compelling and disturbing historical fact that the recruitment of soldiers for the
“People’s Crusade” in France, Germany, and the
Low Countries established a disturbing new
and seemingly addictive habit in Western life:
pogroms against the Jews. It would appear that

the idea of the people requires the external
identification of an evil enemy who can be legitimiately annihilated in the name of God. Such
has arguably always been the justificatory logic
of Western military intervention: it is right to
exterminate the enemy because they are the
incarnation of evil. Such views have always
vindicated crusaders from the eleventh century
through to their more recent epigones. From
the time of Saladin’s destruction of the Third
Crusade in the late twelfth century, the response
has always been the same: jihad or war against
infidels. It is perhaps not so surprising that
Saddam Hussein sought to depict himself in
propaganda alongside Saladin. After all, they
were both born in Tikrit, despite the awful irony
that Saladin was a Kurd.
What is implied fairly discreetly by Cohn and
rather loudly trumpeted by Gray is that Western
civilization might be defined in terms of the
central role of millenarian thinking. What takes
root with early Christian belief and massively
accelerates in medieval Europe finds its modern
expression in a sequence of bloody utopian
political projects, from Jacobinism to Bolshevism, Stalinism, Nazism, and different varieties
of Marxist-Leninist, anarchist, or Situationist
ideology. Much of John Gray’s Black Mass
attempts to show how the energy of such
utopian political projects has drifted from the left
to the right. The apocalyptic conflict with the
axis of evil by the forces of good has been
employed by Bush, Blair et al. as a means to
forge the democratic millennium, a new American
century of untrammeled personal freedom and
free markets. In the past decade, millennial faith
has energized the project of what we might
call military neoliberalism, where violence is the
means for realizing liberal democratic heaven
on Earth. What is essential to such neoliberal
millenarian thinking is the consolidation of the
idea of the good through the identification of evil,
where the Antichrist keeps putting on different
masks: Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Kim
Jong-il, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, etc., etc.
We saw how Schmitt’s critique of liberalism
led him towards an argument for dictatorship
underpinned by a belief in original sin. Where does
Gray’s naturalization of the concept of original sin
leave us? He powerfully identifies the poison
within liberal humanism, but what is the antidote?

551
writes: “Taoists taught that freedom lies in freeing oneself from personal narratives by identifying with cosmic processes of death and renewal.”
Thus, rather than seeking the company of utopian
thinkers, we should find consolation in the
words of “mystics, poets and pleasure-lovers.”
It is clear that for Gray, like the late Heidegger,
the real source of human problems resides in
the belief that action can transform the world.
Action simply provides a consolation for the
radical insignificance of our lives by momentarily staving off the threat of meaninglessness. At
the core of Gray’s work is a defense of the ideal
of contemplation over action, the ataraxia of the
ancients, where we simply learn to see the mystery as such and do not seek to unveil it in order
to find some deeper purpose within.
Schopenhauer, often read in an abridged
aphoristic form, was the most popular philosopher of the nineteenth century. Nothing
sells better than epigrammatic pessimism. It
gives readers reasons for their misery and words
to buttress their sense of hopelessness and impotence. Such is what Nietzsche called “European
Buddhism.” John Gray is the Schopenhauerian
European Buddhist of our age. What he offers
is a gloriously pessimistic cultural analysis that
rightly reduces to rubble the false idols of the
cave of liberal humanism. Counter to the upbeat
evangelical atheism of Dawkins, Hitchins et al.,
Gray provides a powerful argument in favor
of human wickedness that is consistent with
Darwinian naturalism. It leads to the position that
I call “passive nihilism.”
The passive nihilist looks at the world from a
certain highly cultivated detachment and finds
it meaningless. Rather than trying to act in the
world, which is pointless, the passive nihilist
withdraws to a safe contemplative distance and
cultivates and refines his aesthetic sensibility by
pursuing the pleasures of lyric poetry, birdwatching, or botany, as was the case with the aged
Rousseau. In a world that is rushing to destroy
itself through capitalist exploitation or military crusades (usually two arms of the same killer ape),
the passive nihilist withdraws to an island where
the mystery of existence can be seen for what it
is without distilling it into a meaning. In the face
of the coming century, which in all likelihood will
be defined by the violence of faith and the certainty of environmental devastation, Gray offers

politics and original sin

This is what he calls “political realism.” We have
to accept that the world is in a state of ceaseless
conflict never far from a state of war. In the face
of such conflict, Gray counsels that we have to
abandon the belief in utopia and try to cope with
reality. This means accepting the tragic contingencies of life and the fact that there are simply
moral and political dilemmas for which there
is no solution. We have to learn to abandon
daydreams such as a world of universal human
rights, or that history has a teleological purpose
that underwrites human action. We even have to
renounce the Obama-esque delusion that one’s life
is a narrative that is an episode in some universal story of progress. Against the grotesque distortion of conservatism into the millenarian
military neoliberalism of the neo-conservatives,
Gray wants to defend the core belief of traditional
Burkean Toryism. The latter begins in a realistic
acceptance of human imperfection and frailty,
a version of original sin. As such, the best that
flawed and potentially wicked human creatures
can hope for is a commitment to civilized constraints that will prevent the very worst from
happening. Political realism is the politics of the
least worst.
The most original feature of Gray’s work is
the way in which a traditional conservatism
underpinned by a deep pessimism about human
nature is fused with a certain strand of Taoism.
As Gray points out, “Nothing is more human than
the readiness to kill and die in order to secure a
meaning for life.” The great human delusion is
that action can achieve a terrestrial salvation.
This has led to nothing but bloodshed, the great
slaughter bench of millenarian history. Killer
apes like us have to learn to give up the search
for meaning and learn to see the purpose of aesthetic or spiritual life as the release from meaning. If seeing one’s life as an episode in some
universal narrative of meaning is a delusion,
then the cure consists in freeing oneself from
such narratives. Maybe we just have to accept
illusions. What interests Gray in the subtle paradoxes of the greatest Taoist thinker, ChuangTzu, is the acceptance of the fact that life is a dream
without the possibility or even the desire to
awaken from the dream. If we cannot be free
of illusions, if illusions are part and parcel of
our natural constitution, then why not simply
accept them? In the final pages of Black Mass, Gray

a cool but safe temporary refuge. Happily, we will
not be alive to witness much of the future that
he describes.
I have looked at two interrelated responses to
the thought that the modern concepts of politics
are secularized theological concepts. Schmitt’s critique of constitutional liberalism as anti-political
leads him to a concept of the political that finds
its expression in state sovereignty, authoritarianism, and dictatorship. Gray’s critique of liberal
humanism and the ideas of progress and Providence that it embodies leads him to a political
realism of a traditional Tory variety. He fuses this,
in an extremely compelling way, with what I
have called passive nihilism. Both conceptions of
the political are underpinned by ideas of original
sin, whether the traditional Catholic teaching or
Gray’s Darwinian naturalization of the concept.
The refutation of any and all forms of utopianism
follows from this concept of original sin. It is
because we are killer apes that our metaphysical
longing for a conflict-free perfection of humanity can only be pursued with the millennial
means of violence and terror.

`pop art 
“Pop art” was a term apparently first
used by the British art critic Lawrence Alloway
during a series of seminars organized by the
Independent Group at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in the early 1950s. In
its original British meaning (most fully explored
by the artist and teacher, Richard Hamilton),
“pop art” drew attention to the aesthetic value of
American mass-produced goods – cars, clothes,
domestic appliances, magazines, comics, etc. In
particular, the Independent Group argued that
these “pop” works were at the leading edge of
the artistic exploration of new technical means of
visual production and communication, and they
thus challenged the conventional distinction

between high and low Culture, between “pure”
and “applied” Art. If this was initially a theoretical or pedagogical point, and simply meant
framing commodities and advertisements as art
works for study, for formal analysis, Hamilton
soon began to incorporate pop objects and
images into his own work, and his biggest influence on students like Peter Blake and British pop
artists of the 1961 Young Contemporaries exhibition was his collage Just what is it that makes
today’s homes so different, so appealing? in the
1956 Independent Group show, “This is tomorrow.” “Pop art” thus came to describe gallery art
that “borrowed” mass cultural imagery, and this
was certainly true in the United States where the
label “pop art” was applied to such painters
as Jasper Johns (originally a commercial artist)
who began to show his painting series of banal
objects in 1958; Claes Oldenburg who opened “The
Store” (selling painted plaster replicas of food
and food containers) in 1961; Roy Lichtenstein,
whose first blown-up comic strips were shown
in 1962; and Andy Warhol. There were marked
differences in aesthetic strategy between British and
American pop artists (the former more romantic in their use of pop material, the latter more
concerned with technique and realism) and also,
just as important, between their respective art
worlds. What was more obvious in New York than
London was that pop art was not just an aesthetic
movement, but also carried its own commercial
implications (most enthusiastically and brilliantly seized on by Warhol), as the use of icons
turned paintings into advertisements for themselves, as pop art imagery was deployed as pop
imagery, and as artists were marketed as stars.

`popular culture 
“Popular culture” is a term
which in both everyday and academic usage
quickly slips free from its ties to any firm theoretical account of either Culture or the popular. It
is obviously a concept that only makes sense as a
comparative, although the implied contrast is
not obvious at all: “unpopular culture” is not a
commonly used descriptive term (and its meaning would anyway be unclear), and the more
usual comparisons are, in fact High Culture,
Folk culture, and mass culture. A further

problem is that “popular culture” is used, often
interchangeably and somewhat confusingly, to
refer to both specific cultural and symbolic
objects and to “a whole way of life.”
In analytical practice there seems to have
been, then, three overlapping ways in which the
term “popular culture” has been used. First,
popular culture is defined as that culture which
is produced for the people. The “people” in this
approach are thus taken to be a sector of the market, a body of consumers, and “popular culture”
describes certain commodities. This is the context in which popular culture is distinguished
from folk culture by reference to its industrial
means of production. However, the term is also
used in distinction from mass culture by reference
to an argument about consumption. “Popular
culture” implies a culture rooted in particular
(usually class-based) social processes, relations,
and values; “the people” are not the anonymous
“masses.” In short, in this commercial context,
“popular culture” is both a quantitative and
qualitative concept; it refers to audience size – to
be popular a record or film or fiction must sell
or be viewed in relatively large numbers (relative
to the sales and viewing figures for high cultural
or elite goods); it also refers to the quality of these
consumers and viewers, to their attitudes to and
uses of cultural goods – to be “popular” a record
or film or fiction must be consumed in certain
ways (ways clearly differentiated from those
in which cultural elites consume their goods).
In the end, in fact, the qualitative measure is
more important than the quantitative measure
in this context. Although many “popular” songs,
films, and television shows have smaller sales
and viewing figures than successful classical
records, art movies, and high-quality TV programs,
the distinguishing label “popular” still seems
appropriate.
In this respect, the marketplace approach
overlaps with another definition of popular
culture as the culture of the people, as those
symbolic objects and practices which somehow
express or give shape to popular beliefs, values,
and traditions. This definition is continuous
with (rather than opposed to) the concept of
folk culture (though now applied to industrial peoples), and implies that what makes a commodity
“popular” is not for whom (or for how many
people) it is produced (the market definition) but

for New Zealand in 1937. He taught at Canterbury College of the University of New Zealand
until 1945. Here he wrote his seminal work
on political theory, The Open Society and Its
Enemies (1945). This catapulted him into an
international career in philosophy. Popper went
on to teach philosophy at the London School
of Economics and Political Science for over two
decades. He retired as Professor of Logic and
Scientific Method. Popper was knighted in 1965,
and died in 1994.
Popper’s influence on the philosophy of
Science has been phenomenal. Best known for
introducing the “falsification” criterion, Popper
argued that scientific laws cannot be conclusively proved: they can only be falsified. By this
Popper meant that no amount of verification of
a scientific law would guarantee its truth value.
It has been known since the time of the philosopher David Hume that no number of observation
sentences of the form “X causes Y” can lead to a
provable generalization – a counterinstance to
a scientific law cannot be logically ruled out.
Induction is a habit of mind; it is not a logical
necessity. This makes all scientific knowledge
provisional. Popper’s achievement lies in shifting the philosophical emphasis from the truth
value of a theory to the rationale for theory
choice.

popular culture

how it is interpreted. The cultural meaning of a
commodity, in other words, is determined in
the social processes of consumption (even if
such processes inevitably include forms of recognition and appreciation of what is taken to be “in”
the cultural community at issue). This approach
depends, then, on a definition of the “people” as
a specific social group, with delineated social ties
and values. In British Cultural studies the
people were thus originally defined in Class
terms: popular culture meant working-class culture (see Hoggart, 1959), although such groups
may now be defined along other social fissures –
in terms of black popular culture, Scottish popular culture, women’s popular culture, and so on.
Two features of this approach to popular culture need stressing. First, it refers to the history
of the popular, to the ways in which past values
and devices are embedded in cultural Texts
such that they represent people’s sense of their
own historical identity. Second, an important
purpose of popular culture from this perspective
is to mark off a social group from other social
groups, to establish the terms of cultural difference. Culture is thus a discursive practice, and
the critical theorist must be able to read the
signs; popular culture can, in this respect, be
defined in formal terms (and there may be a
more or less tight “homology” drawn between
cultural form and group values). Popular culture,
in short, is that culture which expresses the
aesthetic, ideological, hedonistic, spiritual, and
symbolic values of a particular group of people;
we can read those values in popular practices,
Texts, and objects. From this analytic perspective, in other words, we will describe, say, a TV
show as “popular television” not because of its
viewing figures, nor because of its producers’
marketing tactics, but because of its formal
qualities, its aesthetic strategies, its organization
of pleasure.
Though this approach thus becomes textbased (with institutions and practices read as
texts, as in Hoggart’s work), it clearly overlaps with
a third definition: popular culture as the culture
produced by the people. The reference point here
is not amateur production, do-it-yourself craft,
domestic versions of the professional arts, but
people’s ways of life. Popular culture is defined
here in anthropological terms, by reference to
processes as well as objects, to relationships as well

as images. Popular culture thus becomes “everyday life”, what “the people” do, ways of talking,
eating, dressing, playing, working, worshipping.
. . . Such activities can be treated in detached,
descriptive terms, in a kind of obsessive mapping
of cultural idiosyncrasy (as familiar, for example,
in so-called “popular studies” in the United
States), or in more political, conflictual terms, by
drawing attention to the ways in which groups
wrest and exercise symbolic power for themselves (see, for example, Paul Willis’s concept
of “common culture” in Willis, 1990). Either
way, academic analysts occupy an ambiguous
relationship to the object of study, to a culture
which is both strange and familiar, part of their
own everyday lives yet foreign to them, and
the application of such anthropological methods
as ethnography to one’s own culture (which
became increasingly common in popular cultural
studies in the 1980s) is fraught with difficulty, not
least the temptation to define “popular culture”
as the “other” of academic culture, thus assigning to “the people” the solutions to intellectuals’
own cultural and ideological dilemmas.
The problem here (and it is a problem for the
academic analysis of popular culture whatever
definition is initially adopted) is how to define
“the people.” The implicit argument (reflecting the
history of Cultural studies) is that the people
are working-class people, that popular culture
is working-class culture. However, this equation
becomes problematic if theorists are not, in
fact, drawing on Marxist social theory, and it
becomes particularly problematic when applied
to contemporary media culture – the “working
class” is not necessarily the primary market
for “popular” books or films or records, for
top-rating television programs or even tabloid
newspapers. One solution to this problem is
to refine references to social class, to focus on
different cultural categories, always qualifying
“popular culture” with another adjective – black
popular culture, teenage popular culture, rural
popular culture, etc.
Another strategy is to change tack altogether,
and to see the very term “popular,” the very idea
of “a people,” as itself the cultural issue one
should be investigating. “Popular culture” can then
be used to describe those commodities, those
activities, those symbolic institutions which produce the people, which produce, that is to say, a

555
be that the consumption of popular performers
(Madonna, say) or texts (Married with Children,
for example) is, in itself, a political act. This is
not an argument that is likely to be sustained in
the 1990s – popular culture is too tricky an idea
to be pinned down by such a neat gesture.

`positivism 
A philosophical theory or doctrine
which combines a number of theses about the
nature of knowledge and reality. As with all
philosophical theories there is much debate
about its own nature although the following
indicate its major theses: (i) What really exists is
what can be experienced by the senses or what
is susceptible to experimental manipulation.
(ii) This reality is the subject matter of science.
(iii) Only scientific knowledge is genuine knowledge. (iv) Nonscientific cognitive claims, such
as those of myth, religion, and metaphysics, are
idle and spurious.
Although these theses have older origins, it is
Auguste Comte (1798–1857) who is regarded as
the founder of positivism as a doctrine. He put
forward a historical theory, according to which
human thought evolves through theological and
metaphysical stages until it reaches the positive
or scientific stage, in which science consists
of descriptive laws of phenomena able to be
experienced, rejecting “explanations” in terms
of “causes” or any other hidden essences or
mysterious entities.
Positivism took a somewhat different direction in the twentieth century, when Logical
positivism became the official outlook of the
philosophers and scientists of the Vienna Circle,
who were able to benefit from the much more
sophisticated methods of philosophical and
logical analysis supplied by Frege, Russell, and
Wittgenstein. The logical positivists developed
a demarcation principle to separate science
from nonscience; this stated that only scientific
statements were open to verification by empirical procedures. This was combined with the

positivism

particular form of collective identity, a particular set of attitudes and values, a particular
sort of recognition, a particular sense of belonging. Popular culture in this sense has obvious
implications for and effects upon the social
categories of nation and Race, Gender and
Class, age and taste.
The focus here shifts back to texts (texts as activities as well as objects), but now in terms of their
popular cultural work – their modes of address,
their construction of audiences, their symbolizing power. The questions this approach raises
concern the relationship between the “popular”
and “the public,” and the definition of popular
culture thus becomes a political issue, related to
the political problem of mobilizing the people (as
in different forms of democratic and populist
movement). The “popular,” to put this another
way, defines the site of a particular sort of struggle for political and ideological power (for this
argument see Open University, 1989).
The importance of the Open University
approach to popular culture was not its theoretical sophistication, nor its attempt to apply a
range of analytic methods to a complex, multifaceted issue, but its understanding that the
essence of popular culture is its conceptual slipperiness, its fluidity, and lack of clear definition.
Any critical analysis of popular culture must,
therefore, be concerned to open up the concept
rather than to close it down. This became
clear in the 1980s, when cultural studies took a
populist turn (partly as an effect of its increasing
success as a teaching and textbook subject, partly
in its response to the influence of populism in
broader debates about state and market and cultural value). It became commonplace, for example, to equate “popular” with the commercially
successful (begging the question of the relationship between a commercial transaction and a
cultural investment; we do not necessarily like
the films we go to or the programs we watch)
and, simultaneously, with the working class, the
economically “powerless” (begging the question
of how class is constituted by culture). The result
was a position (see Fiske, 1989, for example) in
which “popular culture” describes both commercially successful commodities (by one definition) and “resistant” practices (by another), but
in which it is not therefore seen to be essentially
contradictory. Rather, the implication seems to

“verification principle,” which linked the meaning of a statement with its method of empirical
verification. Since nonscientific statements had
no method of empirical verification, they were
literally nonsense! Thus the logical positivists
believed that they had eliminated from philosophy all its traditional religious and metaphysical
aspects, leaving only logic and a scientifically
pristine theory of knowledge.
The overall aim of positivism was to boost the
claims of science as the one and only true
approach to understanding the world, including
the social world. Although this aim is still widely
held, the details of positivist philosophy have
been heavily attacked by critics such as Quine,
Popper, Kuhn, Feyerabend, and many others,
and the positivist movement has all but disappeared. Nevertheless, positivism has had a
highly positive impact on late twentieth-century
thought, and it does not deserve its fate of having degenerated to such an extent that the term
is now largely used negatively to denounce any
view which is too narrow, too empiricist, or
which predates Postmodernism.

`postanalytic philosophy 
A movement of
thought that rejects many tenets of the mainstream
(“analytical”) tradition dominant in AngloAmerican philosophy since the 1920s. This tradition was characterized chiefly by the premise
that everyday (natural) language may often give
rise to error – or to “systematically misleading”
forms of expression – by its failure to articulate
logical distinctions with sufficient clarity or rigor.
Hence (for instance) Gottlob Frege’s canonical
distinction between sense and reference, designed
to explain how seemingly tautologous or pleonastic statements (like “the Evening Star is identical

with the Morning Star”) may in fact possess
informative content by virtue of our ability to grasp
precisely that distinction. Bertrand Russell’s
“theory of descriptions” – as applied to the
analysis of empty (nonreferring) expressions like
“the present King of France” – was another
paradigmatic example of this attempt to get
beyond the surface confusions of everyday or
ordinary language, and thereby reveal a more
perspicuous order of logico-semantic form.
The label “postanalytic” is one that is nowadays
attached to so many diverse, loosely affiliated
schools of thought that it might seem to lack
any adequate definitional criteria. It is perhaps
best described as a reactive movement, one that
rejects any version of the drive to regiment
language on a basis of clear-cut logical terms and
distinctions. Its earliest showing was the argument
brought against Logical positivism by critics
who remarked that a central plank in that program – the so-called verification principle – was
incapable of coherent formulation. This program
held that the class of meaningful statements
was that class whose members were exclusively
restricted to (i) factual or empirical propositions, the truth of which could be cashed out in
terms of observational warrant; and (ii) analytic
(or self-evidently valid) statements – like “all
bachelors are unmarried men” – whose truth
was a function of their logical form, that is,
whose predicates were “contained in” their subjects and which were therefore true by definition
while conveying no factual or informative content. All other expressions must henceforth be
treated as meaningless or merely “metaphysical.”
The latter ranged from our everyday (unregimented) statements of veridical belief to the
languages of Ethics, Aesthetics, Literary
criticism, and suchlike “emotive” habits of talk.
For a while this argument seemed to carry
great force, even among literary theorists like
I.A. Richards. Thus Richards felt himself driven
to concede that the “truth” of poetry was a matter of its purely emotive benefits, its capacity to
evoke certain moods – or certain complex states
of attitudinal response in the reader – which had
nothing to do with its truth as construed in propositional or referential terms. A similar strategy
characterized the American New criticism of the
1940s and 1950s. These thinkers took issue doctrinally with Richards’s psychologistic approach,

557
problems it inherits from logical positivism. As
these critics have often pointed out, that program
self-evidently failed to meet its own stipulative
requirements. That is to say, the verification
principle could be justified neither by empirical
proof nor in virtue of its logical form, its standing to reason as a matter of purely analytic
(tautological) truth. Later on, this criticism was
extended to the various proposed substitute
doctrines (such as logical Empiricism), which
attempted to save some version of the analytic
Paradigm – the commitment to principles of
logical consistency, conceptual rigor, and empirical truth – while abandoning the verification
principle in its original (self-refuting) form.
What I shall seek to do in the remainder of this
essay is trace the often tangled skein of alliances
– whether overtly acknowledged or not – which
makes up the postanalytic “turn” in present-day
philosophical debate.
On one possible version the account would
go back to J.L. Austin and exponents of the
“ordinary language” approach that dominated
Oxford philosophy during the 1950s and 1960s.
In their view – also much influenced by the
later Wittgenstein – it was altogether wrong to
suppose that language stood in need of logical
regimentation, or that mere “analysis” could
somehow uncover truths more important than
the great stock of wisdom enshrined in the
nuances, distinctions, and subtleties of usage to
be gleaned from our everyday habits of talk.
Thus Wittgenstein came to think that most
philosophical problems were the result of language
“going on holiday,” or of philosophers becoming
lost in abstruse and pointless puzzles of their
own artificial devising. All that was required,
by way of curative influence, was to redirect
attention to the range and multiplicity of our
everyday communal “language games” and,
beyond these, to the various cultural “forms of life”
which provided their only needful legitimizing
context. Then again there were those, Gilbert
Ryle among them, who adopted a kind of
midway position, maintaining an attitude of
qualified respect for the sanctions of customary
usage while also remarking the various sorts of
error – or “category-mistake” – which resulted
from folk-psychological beliefs like the notion of
mind and Body as existing in separate (though
somehow connected) ontological realms. Clearly

postanalytic philosophy

since they wanted criticism to be “objective” in
the sense that it located meaning (or structures
of complex verbal interaction) strictly within
the “words on the page” as construed through
techniques of rhetorical close reading, quite
apart from all the vagaries of individual reader
response. Nevertheless, they sought to avoid any
confrontation with the claims of Logical positivism by treating Poetry as a privileged realm
of “ambiguity,” “irony,” “paradox,” “plurisignification,” etc., thereby cutting it off at a
stroke from any dealing with language in its
other (cognitive, veridical, or referential) aspect.
This movement of retreat is visible not only
in Anglo-American criticism, where the impact
of logical positivist thinking was felt at an early
stage. It is also very marked in French
Structuralism and Poststructuralism, as
can be seen in a work like Roland Barthes’s
Critique et vérité. Barthes was reacting against
an older and (as he saw it) a thoroughly hidebound tradition of positivist scholarship dominant in French academic thought since the time
of Auguste Comte. However, his response – like
that of Richards though pushed to a more
paradoxical and provocative extreme – was again
to drive a wedge between “truth” and criticism,
and thus to equate literature (écriture) with
whatever exceeded, contested, or subverted the
grim paternal law of method and system.
This brief background history may help to explain why so many thinkers of otherwise diverse
persuasion have come to be grouped under the
rubric “postanalytic.” They include both downright rejectionists and cautious revisionists,
literary theorists with no time for “philosophy,”
and philosophers of a broadly Hermeneutic
(or “continental”) bent with a good deal of time
for literary theory. In the latter camp also are
neopragmatists like Richard Rorty who wish
to have done with “philosophy” in the old (constructive, analytic, or problem-solving) mode, but
who think that we should keep the conversation
going for the sake of its pluralist or democratic
ethos; thinkers of a Communitarian persuasion
who reject “foundationalist” (truth-based) arguments in favor of an appeal to consensus-based
notions of the ethical and social good; and –
among the “cautious revisionists” – philosophers
who have criticized the analytic program from
within (so to speak) by remarking on the various

postanalytic philosophy

558
there is a tension between Ryle’s approach and
the Austin–Wittgenstein line since “ordinary
language” is itself shot through with numerous
relics of Cartesian dualism, relics that Ryle summarily dismissed as the myth of the “ghost in
the machine.” Hence what Richard Rorty and
others have noted as an emergent split or parting of the ways within the broad camp of so-called
linguistic philosophy.
That the term “postanalytic” has sometimes
been applied to philosophers like W.V.O. Quine
is largely the result of their adopting a holistic
theory of meaning and truth which rejects any
version of the Frege/Russell argument. Such is the
upshot of Quine’s celebrated attack, in his essay
“Two dogmas of empiricism,” on the idea of a
clear-cut distinction between analytic and synthetic
orders of judgment, or those that are self-evidently
true in virtue of their logical form (that is,
whose predicate is wholly contained within their
subject) and those that include some element of
empirical or real-world knowledge by acquaintance. In Quine’s view this distinction has to go,
along with various other items of otiose a priori
conceptual baggage, among them the dualism of
“content” and “scheme” and the Fregean idea
of propositions as bearing determinate values of
truth and falsehood, since these alone give a hold
for analysis in terms of the distinction between
sense and reference. Thus Quine sees no point
in halting the contextualist movement which
started out by treating the proposition (rather
than the word) as its minimal unit of significance, and which must surely end, so he argues,
by extending this holist principle to the entire
“fabric” or “web” of beliefs taken as true at any
given time in any given community of knowledge.
From this it follows (again contra Frege and
Russell) that our current ontological commitments must be viewed as contingent or culturespecific, and not as possessing some privileged
status – some ultimate claim to truth – such that
they could never be subject to revision as a result
of changes in our overall structure of beliefs.
What is more, this relativity extends all the way
from what we take as empirical truths of fact (those
belonging to the “periphery” of the web where
observation statements supposedly match with
reality) to propositions at the “analytic’ core,
which we think of as embodying “laws of
thought,” or as including principles (like non-

contradiction or excluded middle) which cannot
be revised without falling into manifest nonsense
or illogicality. Quine sees absolutely no reason
to maintain this distinction. According to him,
we can always redistribute predicates across the
whole fabric of accepted belief so as to preserve
some particular favored item, even if – as occurs
(arguably) in certain interpretations of quantum
mechanics – this means abandoning the ground
rules of logical thought. “Any statement can be
held true come what may, if we make drastic
enough adjustments elsewhere in the system”
(Quine, p. 44). Thus there is ultimately no
deciding, in point of ontological status, between
centaurs, Homer’s gods, numbers, set-theoretical
classes, and brick houses on Elm Street.
That he himself has some fairly strong preferences in this regard – for example, for brick
houses over centaurs and set theory over Homer’s
gods – is nothing more than a product of his
own (albeit firmly held) commitment to a given
ontological scheme, namely that of the presentday physical sciences. “For my part,” he concedes, “I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical
objects and not in Homer’s gods; and I consider
it a scientific error to believe otherwise” (Quine,
p. 44). Nevertheless, as regards their epistemological status, “the physical objects and the gods
differ only in degree and not in kind,” for “both
sorts of entities enter our conception only as
cultural posits.” No doubt there comes a point
where we must choose between them, if only to
avoid cluttering our schemes with all manner
of redundant or otiose items. Thus “the myth
of physical objects is epistemologically superior
to most in that it has proved more efficacious
than other myths as a device for working a manageable structure into the flux of experience”
(p. 44). However, these distinctions are again
“only a matter of degree,” of what Quine calls
the “vaguely pragmatic inclination to adjust
one strand of the fabric of science rather than
another in accommodating some particular
recalcitrant experience” (p. 46). That is to say, we
are mistaken – still attached to one or other
residual dogma of Empiricism – if we take such
choices to embody something more than a preferential means of adjusting the fabric with least
disturbance to our current habits of belief.
I have taken this rather lengthy excursus
via Quine in order to point up some of the

559
instance, the transitional periods of crisis that
occurred at the turning point between Ptolomeic
and Copernican conceptions of the solar system;
in the passage from Newtonian (absolute) ideas
of gravity, space, and time to their reinterpretation as special cases within Einstein’s more
encompassing general theory of relativity; and –
most recently – with the emergence of quantum
mechanics as a theory that has forced some
radical rethinking of the very nature of scientific
explanation vis-à-vis the putative ground rules of
classical logic. In each case, so it is argued, the shift
is such as to reconfigure the entire domain of
objects, events, physical laws, and the modes of
understanding best fitted to cope with recalcitrant
or anomalous data.
Thus Quine takes quantum mechanics as his
chief exhibit in pressing the strong revisionist
claim that there is absolutely nothing – even the
supposed a priori “laws” of logical thought – that
might not be subject to some measure of pragmatic “adjustment” under pressure from the
evidence of new observations thrown up by the
physical sciences. And Feyerabend goes one better
than Kuhn – “better” by his own lights as a selfprofessed “anarchist” in epistemological matters
– when he urges that we sink the difference
between “normal” and “revolutionary” periods of
scientific thought. In his view science can become
more creative (as well as more socially responsible) by dropping its old, objectivist pretense of
disciplined inquiry, protocols of method, established research procedures, etc., and acknowledging the open-ended range of possibilities – of
alternative redescriptions – that results from this
conversion to a thesis of wholesale ontological
relativity. These arguments have not been lost on
“postanalytical” philosophers like Richard Rorty,
anxious to bid farewell to philosophy as a rational, constructive, truth-seeking discipline. What
should now take its place, in Rorty’s view, is the
idea of an ongoing “cultural conversation” where
philosophy – or the Discourse still bearing that
name for want of any handy alternative – gives
up on its old self-deluding (for instance, epistemological or ethical) pretensions. It can then offer
various novel metaphors, vocabularies, narratives, or modes of inventive self-description
which serve an “edifying’’ (as opposed to a constructive or a problem-solving) purpose, and
which thereby resist the encroachment of other

postanalytic philosophy

resemblances between his position and other
present-day versions of the argument from or to
ontological relativity. What they all have in common is the break with any form of truth-functional
or proposition-based analysis, that is, any theory
– like those of Frege or Russell – that would seek
to define the logical structure of well-formed
referring expressions. What they put in its
place is a doctrine of meaning-holism which relativizes truth and reference to the entire existing
set of beliefs, truth claims, or attitudinal dispositions which happens to prevail within some
given community of knowledge. This doctrine
received its most detailed critical review in the book
by Fodor and Lepore, Holism: A Shopper’s Guide
(1991). Their conclusion, briefly stated, is that there
exist, as yet, no compelling or decisive reasons
for adopting this view, and that on balance the
problems outweigh the benefits when applied to
issues in epistemology, ontology, philosophy of
Science, cognitive psychology, and other fields.
One such problem, clearly visible in Quine, is
that of radical meaning-variance between ontological schemes. This is the doctrine that terms
(whether referring expressions or logical connectives) may undergo drastic revision in the
passage from one scheme to another, with the
result that nothing could ultimately count as
an instance of adequate translation or crossparadigm understanding.
It is the same line of argument that has been
taken up by skeptical or relativist philosophers of
science, among them Thomas Kuhn and, more
egregiously, Paul Feyerabend. According to
them, the process of paradigm change is such as
to prevent any possible assurance that we possess
transtheoretical criteria of meaning or reference
for terms like “mass,” “gravity,” “combustion,”
“atom,” “electron,” and so forth. It follows from
the Quinean thesis of meaning-holism that these
terms can be construed only in relation to the
various frameworks of belief – or favored ontological schemes – wherein they have played
a role from one such paradigm to the next.
Moreover, it happens on occasion, according to
Kuhn, that science undergoes a period of radical
(“revolutionary”) change when even its most
basic presuppositions are called into doubt,
thus creating a likewise wholesale shift in the
operative sense (or definitional criteria) attached
to certain crucial concepts. Such were, for

postanalytic philosophy

560
– state-sponsored or quasi-universalist – limits on
our private freedom.
My point here is that Rorty arrives at this
extreme version of the dichotomy between
private and public realms by way of a doctrine
of meaning-holism that derives from both
“postanalytical” thinkers like Quine and Kuhn
and philosophers in the broadly hermeneutic
(“continental”) tradition such as Heidegger,
Gadamer, and – more questionably – Derrida.
For indeed Rorty is nothing if not eclectic. Other
sources include Wilfred Sellars (on the “myth
of the given”), the later Wittgenstein for his
problem-dissolving talk of “language games” or
cultural “forms of life,” and Michel Foucault
– whether as “archaeologist’’ or Nietzschean
“genealogist’’ of knowledge – for his holistic
leveling of the natural and the human sciences
to so many shifting configurations in the
omnipresent order of “discourse,’’ analyzed on
principle without the least regard to issues of
validity or truth. What these all have in common,
despite their manifest differences of styles and
approaches, is the idea (again contra Frege and
Russell) that propositions should enjoy no privileged status as bearers of determinate truth or
falsehood values, since the “unit of meaning’’ (in
Quinean parlance) is the entirety of language,
discourse, or beliefs held true at any given time.
This comes out most clearly in Rorty’s habit of
jumping clean across from talk of “vocabularies’’
to equally vague talk of the “language game’’ or
“cultural conversation,’’ in which those vocabularies somehow find their place. Nowhere are we
offered any adequate explanation of just what
role (scientific, critical, historical, ethical, etc.)
those vocabularies are supposed to play, of the
specific truth claims or validity conditions that
apply to different orders of discourse, or of just
why one such language game should at length –
and for reasons other than mere boredom with
the old way of talking – give way to a preferred
alternative. For Rorty, as indeed for Foucault,
it appears to be a process of random cultural
drift, with the minimal difference that Foucault
speaks dramatically of seismic disruptions and
“epistemological breaks,’’ where Rorty adopts a
more laid-back idiom of periodic changes in the
“cultural conversation.’’
It seems to me that little of value can emerge
from the current, much-heralded rapprochement

between “postanalytic” and continental philosophy so long as it pursues this line of least resistance premised on doctrines of meaning-holism
and full-scale ontological relativity. Such arguments
have taken a variety of forms, depending on the
candidates put up for election to the new crossparty alliance. Thus Rorty greets Foucault as a
sympathetic spirit in so far as he can plausibly be
read as a “private ironist,” one who is content
to pursue his own project of aesthetic “selffashioning” – or come up with new “vocabularies” to describe that project – while not straying
into the public domain of politics, social theory,
or ethics in the wider (non-self-preoccupied)
sense. That Foucault’s later thoughts on the “care
of the self ” are at times open to such a reading
is one result of his espousing a version of this
present-day linguistic turn, this holistic dispersal
of meaning and truth across the range of “discourses” that somehow both constitute the subject and provide his or her only means of private
self-cultivation. How there could possibly be a
self to cultivate – given his (and Rorty’s) attitude
of wholesale skepticism toward any “deep further
fact” about the self and its modes of understanding, reflective self-knowledge, ethical judgment, etc. – is, to say the least, something of a
puzzle. This puzzle is directly related to their
holistic (or all-out contextualist) view of “truth”
as just a product of the way that beliefs hang
together in the various language games, discourses, or “final vocabularies” that happen to
prevail, for no particular reason, at this or that
given time. It then becomes simply impossible to
conceive how ethics might be founded on an
exercise of responsible judgment in respect of
what is known (to the best of our critical capacity) from the exercise of truth-seeking thought.
There is the same problem about current
attempts to establish an alliance between postanalytic philosophy and hermeneutics in the
Heideggerian or depth-ontological mode. Rorty
has made a number of essay-length overtures
in this direction, though his promised book on
Heidegger has never materialized, perhaps on
account of precisely this difficulty. Other commentators – Mark Okrent among them – have all
the same pressed ahead with Rorty’s project to the
point of claiming Heidegger as a kind of honorary
pragmatist malgré lui, one who can be coaxed back
into the fold by stressing his talk of situated

561
to questions of meaning and truth. As I have said,
they differ quite considerably in the extent of
their commitment to Heidegger’s project, that is,
their willingness to value his thought at its own
“epochal” or world-transformative estimate,
rather than treating it – like Rorty – as a source
of new language games, “final vocabularies, or
optional metaphors we can live by.” In fact one
could argue that it is a mark of the “postanalytic”
appropriation of Heidegger – as distinct from
the work of echt-Heideggerian commentators –
that the former sorts of commentary always
entail some degree of doctrinal nonattachment,
some drawing back at the point of endorsing his
more “ontological” pronouncements. Rorty is
the most explicit about this, since according to him
what is useful in Heidegger (as likewise in Hegel,
Nietzsche, Dewey, Foucault, Derrida et al.) is
simply his offering a novel set of terms for the
ongoing “cultural conversation,” and thereby
helping to wean us away from old (for example,
Kantian or “analytic”) styles of talk. Dreyfus
and Okrent are perhaps best seen as halfway
converts with a strong pragmatist leaning and with
at least sufficient analytical awareness not to be
drawn entirely into the realm of Heidegger’s
depth-ontological talk.
So there is reason to think, without undue
skepticism, that “postanalytic” philosophy is at
present just one of those modish terms (along with
“postmodernism” and the like) which serve to
cover a multitude of otherwise fissile and disparate
trends. Certainly the prefix “post” is misleading if taken (as it is very often among cultural
and literary theorists) to suggest that there is
no longer any place for the virtues of clear and
precise analytical thought. Perhaps the main
cause of this confusion is the way in which the
term “analytic” has been annexed to the AngloAmerican (as distinct from the “continental”)
tradition of philosophic thought, thus implying
that its fortunes are exclusively bound up with
episodes within that tradition. However, we
might do better to abandon these crudely reductive categorizations and the prejudicial habits
of thought which tend to go along with them.
After all, there are numerous shared concerns, a
genealogy that becomes more complex (or less
clear-cut) the further one traces it back, and – most
important – a common point of departure in those
issues (like the analytic/synthetic dichotomy)

postanalytic philosophy

being-in-the-world and tactfully downplaying
his other, more echt-ontological themes and
concerns. (Hubert Dreyfus’s commentary on
Being and Time accords them a somewhat more
respectful hearing.) What these approaches
share is a sense that analytic philosophy has
arrived at a stage, with its turn toward holistic
or contextualist paradigms, where any talk of
“truth” is in danger of becoming largely redundant. That is to say, it either drops out altogether
(as in Rorty’s neopragmatist appeal to what is
“good in the way of belief”) or else figures
merely as a product of formal definition. Such is
the “disquotational” theory – devised by Alfred
Tarski and taken up by Donald Davidson –
where “true” has the role of a metalinguistic
predicate that applies to every veridical statement in a given language, but which then cancels
out, for all practical purposes, so as to leave
those first-order statements quite unaltered.
Thus for instance: “ ‘snow is white’ is true in
language L iff [that is if and only if] snow is
white.” By means of this formal notation, so the
argument runs, one can generate a corresponding “T-sentence” for every sentence in the object
language, and thus recursively generate a theory
of truth which matches those sentences point for
point in respect of their extension (that is, their
reference) to items of veridical belief.
However, the problem with this whole line of
thought is that it offers nothing more than a
purely circular definition of “truth,” one that
satisfies the formal requirements for such a theory while failing to provide any more specific or
substantive set of criteria. So one can see why many
commentators – Rorty, Dreyfus, and Okrent
among then – have sought a way beyond what
they perceive as this dead-end predicament.
Such is at least one sense of the term “postanalytic philosophy”: the quest for an alternative to
that entire tradition of thought, starting from
logical positivism, whose upshot, after so much
critical scrutiny, seems to be either a formalized
(semantic or metalinguistic) theory of truth
devoid of explanatory content, or on the other
hand a pragmatist conception that reduces truth
to the currency of in-place consensus belief. For
each of the above thinkers it is clear that this alternative must come from outside the analytical
mainstream, and moreover, that it needs a
Heideggerian (or depth-ontological) approach

postcolonial studies

562
which Kant was the first to articulate in their
distinctively modern form. Where on the map
should we place figures like Frege, Husserl, and
(more ambiguously) Wittgenstein, whose work
surely answers to no such tidy parcelling out of
geophilosophical domains? And again, what
reason can there be – ingrained prejudice aside
– for withholding the descriptor “analytic” from
work of such subtlety, rigor, and intelligence as
Derrida’s at its best? Given these problems there
seems little point in defining “postanalytic” philosophy beyond its present function as a label of
convenience, a catch-all term for whatever slips
through the standard doxographical net.

`postcolonial studies 
Unqualified, the term
“postcolonial studies” would incorporate the
study of all the effects of European colonization
in the majority of the Cultures of the world,
and include all the academic disciplines in use in

institutions of learning across the globe. Clearly,
it is only from a great distance, for instance, that
of the Western academy, that so vast a formation
can be assumed to have coherence. Consequently, it is only from the narrowed perspective
of the Western academy that the term “postcolonial studies” appears feasible. This entry
will perforce share such a perspective, focusing on
primarily anglophone postcolonial Cultural
Studies as it has developed in the Western
academy, though this development has of course
had to take note of the work being done elsewhere
in the Third World.
Yet even from this narrowed perspective, the
rubric “postcolonial” has caused anxiety, based
in part on the confusion surrounding the prefix
“post,” and in part on the staggering geographical, temporal, and theoretical sweep of the
term. Cultural critics who read “postcolonial” to
mean “the end of colonialism” are troubled by
its implication that so-called decolonizations in
the Third World effected a clean break from
colonial exploitation. Others, more alert to the
necessary ambiguity of the prefix “post,” do not
take it as a synonym for “de” or “ex,” and are
consequently able to read “postcolonial” to mean
“since colonialism began.” For them, the term
covers a vast terrain of decolonized/neocolonized
cultures that may have witnessed the end of one
phase of Western imperialism – the formal
dismantling of colonial political/administrative
machinery – only to enter the next phase, with
Western imperialism now organizing them in
the interests of its late capitalist economies.
A second objection to the rubric is that, in
its present Western institutional usage, it effectively elides an array of differences: for instance,
between a vast number of nations and cultures in
Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean; between internally colonized European communities, such as
the Irish, and Third World postcolonial nations;
and, finally, between recently postcolonial
Third World nations, and the European-settled
ex-colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and North
America, in which any surviving indigenous
non-European populations are now reduced to
minority status. Structured as it is on the ground
of difference, postcolonial studies is always under
the obligation, outlined by Gayatri C. Spivak and
other theorists, to persistently examine the relationship between various postcolonial formations

563
and finally, that increasingly complex and rigorous ways be found to read cultural practices in
their political contexts.
An older but recurring debate within postcolonial studies is over Third World discourses
of pan-nationalism, nationalism, and diaspora.
Each offers one way for Third World communities to construct cultural and political identities
in opposition to Western imperial prescriptions.
Pan-nationalisms, which arose in the early
phases of some anti-imperial struggles, were
short-lived but powerful movements that added
a great impetus to cultural production. An
example is Negritude, which called on people of
African descent across Africa, Europe, and the
Americas to forge a collective identity beyond
national boundaries, recognize their shared history of oppression and resistance, and celebrate
and preserve a common culture rooted in Africa.
Although Negritude attracted prominent literary
and political figures such as Leopold Senghor
(Senegal) and Aimé Césaire (Martinique), it
was also, from its inception, criticized from
other revolutionary perspectives, for instance,
that of Frantz Fanon (Martinique). Although
he was drawn to the affirmatory politics and
creative energies of Negritude, Fanon found its
oppositional political stance to be a mere reversal rather than a fundamental displacement of
Western ethnocentrism; as such, it remained
locked in the essentialist terms dictated by that
ethnocentrism. Marxists such as Fanon believed
that anti-imperial struggles would necessarily be
organized on the model of the nation-state; if a
cross-continental resistance had to be chosen, it
would need to be based on class rather than race.
Pan-nationalisms generated a vast literary
and cultural archive, much of it committed to
reviving “authentic” and “classic” precolonial
indigenous practices, often in direct challenge
to imperial/colonial pronouncements on the
cultural impoverishment of the colonized. While
appreciating the energy of this cultural project,
critics such as Fanon questioned its nativist
rhetoric of authenticity, and its petrification of
culture into static, essentialized, and classicized
forms outside the reach of the masses. The
debate over authenticity has often been revived
in postcolonial studies, for instance, with the
incorporation of Western Critical theory (see
Appiah, 1984; Bhabha, 1994; and Ngugi, 1986).

postcolonial studies

– and to do so without assuming either their
a priori coincidence (so that one can be made
to represent another in the academy) or their a
priori radical discontinuity (so that the difference
between them need be theorized).
Some have also questioned the rubric “postcolonial” on the grounds that it delineates
Third World nations in terms of their relation to
postcolonizing powers rather than their internal
concerns or their relation to each other. A
related argument is that postcoloniality offers
an inappropriate context for cultural practices
that emerged under (post)colonialism but were
not primarily concerned with this context. These
arguments, based loosely on the feeling that the
rubric “postcolonial” overemphasizes the power
and role of imperialism, come surprisingly often
from the same critics who found the term objectionable because it underestimated the exploitative scope of imperialism as well as itscontinuing
strength (see Ahmad, 1992). The counterargument
for retaining “postcolonial” is that, if it defines
Third World nations according to their relation
to European imperial centers rather than according to their relation to each other, it does so in a
descriptive rather than prescriptive effort to keep
in sight the material homogenization that came
in the wake of past and present imperial control,
and that will not simply disappear if left unnamed.
Indeed, if the common designation “postcolonial”
obligates cultural theorists from various Third
World nations to reflect on their relation to each
other, that is something to be welcomed, not
dreaded. Finally, the criticism that postcoloniality
is a misleading context for Third World cultural
practices that do not directly engage with it is often
met with the rejoinder that Texts produced
within a larger political context can be read in its
terms, whether or not the texts anticipate such
a reading or, more generally, such a positioning
of themselves.
As these debates should make clear, the rapid
institutionalization of postcolonial studies has
resulted in an ongoing and close scrutiny of its
scope and method. For postcolonial studies to
retain its oppositional charge, it will be necessary
that the ambiguity of the prefix “post” be kept in
sight; that specific differences within its rubric
be actively mobilized and understood not just
in terms of national origins but also of Class,
Gender, race, sexual and ethnic orientations;

The majority of anti-imperialist struggles,
especially in the twentieth century, have been
organized not on pan-nationalisms but the model
of the nation-state. Recent discussions of nationalism have historicized this model as something
not ordained in nature but produced in response
to specific needs of European economies during their industrial phase. Critics of nationalism
argue that the nation-state model, held out to
Third World cultures as their only entry into the
global economy after decolonization, did not
necessarily address their specific needs. Further,
nationalist movements were led by middle-class
Western-trained leaders who, in their efforts to
present a united front to colon-ialism, often
curbed the more radical demands of feminists and
subalterns, and were thus unable fundamentally
to transform the oppressive political structures they
inherited from colonialism.
Like pan-nationalisms, nationalist struggles
and Discourses have been immensely productive in the cultural sphere, although their own
rhetoric of authenticity has also raised some
questions from Third World feminist and subaltern critics. In their efforts to preserve an
untainted, classic, precolonial, and indigenous
tradition, these discourses sought to ward off the
influence of living and Popular cultures. As
is frequently the case, they called on women to
assume the role of the keepers of tradition, thus
reimmersing them in the rhetoric of purity and
sanctity, and assigning them the most passive,
secondary, and privatized spaces in the official
narrative of nationalisms (see Jayawardena,
1986; Mohanty, 1991).
The critique of these discourses from the
viewpoint of those excluded by it, such as subalterns and women, is an increasingly powerful
strain within postcolonial studies. This criticism
is sometimes misrepresented as a nostalgia for
colonial Ideology and institutions, and sometimes reduced to a tradition versus Modernity
debate, with indigenous practices being seen as
traditional and therefore oppressive for women
and the subaltern, and the Western as modern
and more emancipatory. In fact, however, few
Third World subaltern and/or feminist critics
of nationalism are apologists for Western imperialism, and few endorse its claims of having
eradicated oppressive feudal and patriarchal
indigenous practices. Instead, scholars such as

the subaltern collective in Indian, Ngugi wa
Thiong’o in Kenya, and Rey Chow in China have
read imperialism as not only actively suppressing
the more feminist and egalitarian of indigenous
institutions and cultural practices, but also as
driving indigenous Patriarchy to increasingly
reactionary excesses against women and subalterns
in an effort to maintain its strength vis-à-vis
the colonizers. Third World feminist and subaltern histories/cultural studies have thus been
engaged in a dual task: close analyses of colonial
and indigenous patriarchal power, and crucial
archival work to recover lost/neglected female
and subaltern cultural texts and resistances. This
work has been tremendously effective in opening up the closed, official narratives of nationalism, and clearing the space for a study of
popular cultural practices, including film and
music; street and creolized languages; oratures (or
oral literatures); and politicized and agitprop
genres such as testimony, prison memoirs, and
street theater.
Contemporary discussions of nationalism have
also had to address the question of postcolonial
Diasporas. Earlier colonial institutions of slavery, indenture, and forced migration, and more
contemporary divisions of labor between the
Third and First Worlds have scattered large
groups of the colonized across the globe. Left to
negotiate new ethnic identities for themselves
vis-à-vis both the European-descended majority
populations and groups of non-European displaced and disenfranchised people, various diasporas from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean have
given rise to questions about multiple-rooted
ethnic identities and languages. Diaspora theorists
such as Homi Bhabha, Rey Chow, Stuart Hall,
Wilson Harris, and Trinh T. Minh ha focus on
cultural production within communities almost
exclusively populated by displaced Third World
populations, such as the Caribbean, as well as
on Third World immigrant cultures within the
First World, such as the black British. From a
variety of theoretical perspectives, these critics
have proposed that identity and language be
read not as closed, static, and imbued with
essences, but rather as performative, “hybrid,” “creolized,” and existing “on the borders” of various
interpellating systems. The focus on diaspora has
also led feminists such as Chandra Mohanty to
call for a dialogue between theorists of gendered

565
reading of power – in its complex colonial,
neocolonial, patriarchal, discursive, and material
manifestations – so as to unsettle its epistemology, its claims to truth, and its strategies of
representation. An attentiveness to the ways in
which meanings are produced and value-coded in
language has always marked postcolonial studies,
exemplified in landmark works such as Edward
Said’s Orientalism (1978). Although formalistuniversalist claims that culture and language are
produced autonomously of the political context
have sometimes been internalized by Third
World writers and critics, especially when postcolonial scholarship was organized under the
rubric of “commonwealth studies,” these claims
have been contested from their inception. As
a result, the theorizing of language and culture has
been central to postcolonial studies, notwithstanding vast differences between various theoretical perspectives.
The role of Western(ized) theories in postcolonial studies has been the first subject of
debate. With the proviso that postcolonial cultural texts have always themselves theorized
meanings and values, critics such as Barbara
Christian have attacked the inaccessible languages of Western theories; their refusal or
inability to speak to the situation of the Third
World; and their institutional effect of distracting postcolonial studies from crucial archival
work and political praxis. Those opposed to
this view maintain that Western theories, which
themselves criticize the closures of Western systems of thought from their margins, can be disengaged from any leanings towards patriarchal
or imperial ideology and thus made useful for
postcolonial studies. Such postcolonial theorists
question the residual nativism beind the blanket
rejection of Western theories, and argue against
the polarization of theory and praxis, or theoretical and empiricist scholarship, urging that while
one kind of work cannot replace the other, each
must be used productively, in Spivak’s words, to
“interrupt” the other and bring it to crisis.
A variety of theoretical approaches characterizes postcolonial studies at present, of which the
three most prominent, the Marxist, the psychoanalytic, and the deconstructive will be briefly
described below. Third World feminisms have
intervened powerfully in each approach, insisting
that it address the concepts of gender, sexuality,

postcolonial studies

subalternity in the Third World and First World
women of color. The concept of diaspora has
emphasized the need for postcolonial studies to
enter a sustained dialogue with Afro-American
or native American studies, again without presupposing an entire coincidence or a complete
discontinuity of interests. Unfortunately, however, such efforts have often been thwarted in
the academy by the phenomenon of various
marginalized studies being made to compete for
resources.
In diaspora communities, the question of language of course takes a very different form from
that of the indigenous cultures of Africa or Asia.
In the latter, activists and theorists such as Ngugi,
who himself turned from writing in English to
writing in Gikuyu, have called for postcolonial
writers to return to indigenous languages. While
acknowledging that postcolonial writing in European languages has subverted these languages
with oral and written indigenous traditions, and
thus displaced colonial literary Paradigms and
genres, Ngugi argues that the most scrupulous
and innovative efforts to Africanize the English
language will still not make that language accessible to the majority of Africans. Further, if
writers continue to work within colonial languages and structures in an effort to subvert
them, they will run the risk of being recuperated
as minor strains and Subcultures within
European cultural traditions. In a similar vein,
Subaltern studies in India have focused not
on the history and cultural production of a
Western-trained middle class writing in English
or classicized indigenous languages, but of disenfranchised Indian masses working in the vernacular. However, in the context of Caribbean or
black British diasporas, where the language of the
majority is a European one, there is clearly less
impetus for returning to the original language
of one’s culture than for creolizing European
languages. This difference notwithstanding,
diaspora theorists and theorists of subalternity
in the Third World share the common goal of
studying the languages not of high culture, but
of the people.
Underlying the debates over the rubric of postcoloniality and over nationalism, pan-nationalism,
and diaspora are various theories of identity and
the production of culture. A central impetus
in postcolonial studies has been the resistant

postcolonial studies

566
and varied discourses of patriarchy not merely
as secondary issues within the larger inquiry,
but rather as questions that could transform the
terms of the inquiry.
Marxist and feminist-Marxist critics have
asked persistent questions about the institutional
apparatuses through which postcolonial cultural
texts are produced and circulated; about the
Hegemony of high literary Aesthetics over
popular culture; about the vanguardist and
“native informant” roles postcolonial intellectuals sometimes assume vis-à-vis the masses; and,
following the intervention of Marxist-feminists,
about the role of gender and sexuality in the production of culture. Although Western Marxists
such as Marx, Mikhail Bakhtin, Antonio
Gramsci, and Louis Althusser have strongly
influenced postcolonial studies, for instance, the
work of Fanon, Spivak, Ngugi, Hall, Chow, and
the subaltern studies collective, some Western
Marxists have also been criticized for their minimal engagement of postcoloniality, and for their
periodization, which positions the Third World
in a time lag in relation to the First, reading it
as the historical past of the First World present
(see, for instance, Fanon’s critique of Jean Paul
Sartre; Said’s critique of Marx; and Madhava
Prasad’s critique of Jameson).
Aspects of psychoanalytic theory have also
powerfully influenced theorists such as Fanon
and Homi Bhabha, feminists such as Trinh T.
Minh ha and Rey Chow, and postcolonial
Althusserians, who have used Psychoanalysis
to complicate Marxist teleological narratives of
power and resistance. Such critics are drawn
to psychoanalysis for its ability to position power
and resistance in the contexts of desire, psychic
investments, and the processes through which
identities are constructed in language. Psychoanalytic critics approach identity as not given
or static, but as performative and staged within
language. By mobilizing Freudian and Lacanian
concepts such as “fetish” and “mimicry” in the
context of postcoloniality, theorists such as
Bhabha have drawn attention to the ambivalences within colonial stereotypes and within
various subject positions occupied by any one
“consciousness.” While Third World psychoanalytic feminists share these interests, they have
also criticized some of the male approaches,
including Fanon’s, for their inability or refusal to

address questions of gender, sexuality, and sexual orientation, and to go beyond the patriarchal
subtexts of thinkers such as Freud. Psychoanalysis continues to have a strong appeal for
Third World feminists such as Trinh and Chow
because of its sustained interest in questions of
sexuality, and its narrativization of sexed and
gendered identity.
However, like Western Marxisms, Western
psychoanalysis has not been embraced uncritically.
The larger Marxist critique of the psychoanalytic
approaches is that they have not theorized
beyond individuated psychic resistances to collective action. An early instance of the unease
generated by the more ahistoricized forms
of psychoanalysis is Fanon’s critique of O.
Mannoni, who isolated such static Paradigms
as the “dependency complex” of the colonized
with little reference to the systemic material
exploitation of colonialism. Third World Marxistfeminists such as Spivak have pointed to the
Orientalism, ahistoricism, and even antifeminism of Freud as well as of some contemporary
French feminists such as Kristeva, while still
suggesting that French feminism can be usefully
extended to a postcolonial context.
Finally, Derridean Deconstruction (rather
than its US version) has strongly influenced the
work of Spivak and translation theorists such as
Tejaswini Niranjana. The appeal of deconstruction for political resistant readings is precisely
its persistent questioning of the kind of originary
and foundational thinking that has characterized
Western universalist, humanist, and colonial
discourses. Spivak also describes deconstruction
as a reading strategy that consistently questions
the objectivity and innocence of the reader, and
is thus of immense use to postcolonial readers
as a reminder of their own complicity in the
structures of thought that they critique.

`postmodernism 
Postmodernism names many
different kinds of cultural object and phenomenon in many different ways. Among these,
perhaps three different applications of the term
may broadly be distinguished. First, postmodernism designates a number of developments in the
arts and Culture in the second half of the
twentieth century. The reference point and point
of departure for this form of postmodernism are
the various forms of modernism that flourished
in the arts and culture in Europe in the first half
of the century. Second, it describes the emergence
of new forms of social and economic organization, again roughly since the end of the 1939–45
war. As such, its reference point and point of
departure is the movement of modernization
which characterized the early years of the century,
with the growth of industry, the rise of the
mass market, and the accelerations in automation,
travel, and mass communication. Third, it signals
a particular kind of theoretical Writing and
reflection, usually, though not exclusively, writing and reflection which takes the first or second
area as its object. It may be useful to distinguish
these three areas of application with the terms postmodernism; postmodernity; and the postmodern.

(It should be said that this division is a convenience adopted for present purposes alone, and
does not correspond regularly to usages of these
three variants in critical writing.)
Diagnoses of postmodernism have extended
to nearly every artistic form and area of cultural
practice, but the argument about the emergence
of a postmodernist reaction to an earlier modernist movement has tended to take its clearest and
strongest form in those areas in which modernism had previously been most clearly and visibly defined, for example, architecture, the visual
arts, and literature. Central to the influential
claims on behalf of postmodernism articulated by
writers such as the architectural critic Charles
Jencks and the literary critic Ihab Hassan was a
sense that the challenge or revolutionary energy
of earlier forms of modernism had hardened
over the twentieth century into conventional
artistic procedures and respectable institutional
forms. There two writers offer markedly different
accounts of the ways in which postmodernism
emerges out of and surpasses this now institutionalized modernism. For Jencks (1991) what is
at stake is the loosening of the authoritarian style
and sensibility of international modernism and the
opening up of architecture to a new diversity of
Styles and functions. Thus the ideal of a building that would be austerely and nakedly itself,
announcing and performing its function without
ornament or excess, is to yield to an ideal of a
building that would variously embrace, mimic, and
converse with its architectural and nonarchitectural contexts. Such an architecture is typically not
pure or self-consistent but hybrid, in terms of
its blending of different styles drawn from past
and present. For Hassan (1987) the postmodernist
impulse is to be found not in a clear break with
modernist styles in literary writing so much as
in a return to some of the more fractious and
uncontrollable forms of Avant-garde practice
that had characterized literary and artistic
modernism at its outset: the consuming fury of
Alfred Jarry’s “pataphysics,” the playful iconoclasm of dadaism, the embrace of dynamism in
vorticism and futurism. Hassan finds support for
this view of postmodernism as a renewal rather
than a surpassing of modernism in the work of
Jean-François Lyotard, for whom, paradoxically, postmodernism may be said to come before
rather than after modernism. “A work can

become modern only if it is first modern,”
Lyotard declares. “Postmodernism thus understood is not modernism at its end but in the
nascent state” (Lyotard, 1984, p. 79).
Central to many definitions of artistic postmodernism is a refusal of the value of aesthetic
autonomy. For many modernist artists and writers, the value of Art was to be defined purely
on its own terms. In criticism of the visual arts
especially, the justification of modernist technique was that it fulfilled Immanuel Kant’s
proposal in his Critique of Judgement (1790) that
aesthetic feelings were or should be wholly disinterested, which is to say independent of the
desires, interests, and conflicts of ordinary life. The
value and purpose of art thus came to be defined
in terms of a number of refusals and negations:
a refusal of personality; a refusal of expressive
intention; a refusal of any ambition to represent
the real world, or represent it realistically; a
refusal of social norms and conventions, especially the conventions of communication itself.
Artistic postmodernism may be defined largely
as a refusal of this refusal – a negation of the
ideal of art’s autonomy and separateness from the
world. For some commentators, this means a
returning sense of the necessary connections
between art and the social and political realm from
which modernism had abstracted it. Where the
ideal of aesthetic autonomy was concentrated for
modernism is the idea that the work of art ought
to be seen as a perfected and self-sufficient object,
for example, a contrary impulse reveals itself in the
dissolution of the artistic object and the fascination with temporal process characteristic of certain
forms of postmodernism, such as the conceptual
and performance art of the 1960s and beyond.
Thus one may summarize the shift in attitudes
toward the work of art from modernism to postmodernism as a new preference for complexity
over purity, plurality over stylistic integrity, and
contingency or connectedness over autonomy.
Postmodernity signifies the breakdown or
radical transformation of the modes of social,
economic, and political modernity that had been
dominant in most Western industrial nations
from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth
century. As with artistic postmodernism, opinions
differ as to whether this constitutes a simple
passage beyond or an intensification of the
capitalist forces expressed in modernity.

One of the earliest and most developed narratives of the emergence of postmodernity was
provided by Daniel Bell in his book The Cultural
Contradictions of Capitalism, first published in
1976. Bell suggests that advanced capitalism has
moved from being an economic and cultural
system based upon the disciplines necessary for
production to one centered on the pleasures of
consumption. This in turn changes the status
of art and culture. Artistic modernism had been
produced, Bell argues, out of a fierce antagonism
between the puritan ethic of work and conformity
and the hedonist cult of self-expression and selfenlargement characteristic of modernist writers and
thinkers such as Nietzsche, Lawrence, Woolf,
and others. A postmodern condition is reached
when these modernist values, which had previously
been the preserve of a small and dissident artistic
minority, become generalized in a consumer
society. Bell is only one of a number of writers
who see the defining condition of postmodernity
as a certain aestheticization of economic conditions: “The autonomy of culture, achieved in
art, now begins to pass over into the arena of life.
The post-modernist temper demands that what
was previously played out in fantasy and imagination must be acted out in life as well. There
is no distinction between art and life. Anything
permitted in art is permitted in life as well”
(Bell, 1979, pp. 53–4).
A similar claim is advanced by Jean Baudrillard, who, in a series of books produced from
the late 1960s onwards, had been criticizing those
economistic theories such as Marxism, which
made the function of the economy the determining factor in social life and saw the forms and
forces of production as the central principle of
every economy. In his early work, Baudrillard
argued that culture and the processes of representation and reproduction more generally had
gained a primacy over the economic “base” from
which Marxist theory held them to be a secondary emanation. Social analysis must learn, he
argued, to understand the primary role of social
Signs, Codes, and languages in contemporary
society. His later work extends this analysis
remarkably to argue that the explosion in the
technological means of simulation and reproduction has brought about a priority of signs
over the real. The postmodern world (though
Baudrillard rarely uses the term) is one in which

569
to speak, dissolves into time. Under these conditions, profit is not measured in terms of material
increase, but as a gain in turnover time, or an
increase in the rate of consumption. Where the
domination of modern capitalism had come
about partly by means of the rationalizing science
and technology that allowed space to be controlled at a distance, the furious pace of transformation in postmodernity creates a sense of place
that is paradoxical and evanescent. Nevertheless,
Harvey insists that these economic and cultural
transformations are extensions of, rather than
fundamental breaks in “the invariant elements and
relations that Marx defined as fundamental to any
capitalist mode of production” (Harvey, 1989,
p. 187). As such he does not, as Baudrillard so
obviously does, abandon the aspiration to provide progressive political understanding of the
present.
For Harvey, as for others such as Scott Lash
and John Urry (1987) and Alan Lipietz (1987),
social and economic postmodernity may be
measured conveniently in terms of the dissolution
of the form of organized capitalism represented
by the Ford motor corporation in the middle years
of the twentieth century. Ford typified a mode
of production which depended upon large,
rationalized factories, dedicated to the mass production of a minimally varied single item. Such a
form of organization is centralized, concentrated
upon production, and driven by economies of
scale. It tends to demand and provide stable and
continuous patterns of employment. A “postFordist” pattern of economic organization, by
contrast, is much more decentralized; today a
motor car will not be assembled in one factory
in one location, but in a variety of locations and
by a number of different workforces, both of
which are subject to sudden and unpredictable
variation, in the pursuit of efficiency or for
political reasons. The dispersal and mobility of
production in past-Fordism is matched to the sense
of the diverse and shifting patterns of demand
in a mass market that is no longer perceived
either as passive or homogeneous. Economies
of scale, based upon the savings in the cost of
production brought about by minimizing variation in the product, give way in post-Fordism
to economies of scope, in which the mobility
of taste and fashion is met by increased differentiation of the product. Thus the largest and most

postmodernism

experience and reality are codified and mediated
to such a point as to have become irretrievable in themselves. Where previous eras can be
characterized by the different kinds of relationship obtaining in them between reality and the
socially produced images of reality, our contemporary world has seen the domination of the
self-sufficient “simulacrum,” the image that
“bears no relationship to any reality whatsoever . . . [and] is its own pure simulacrum”
(Baudrillard, 1983, p. 170). Such a condition
accompanies and is in some ways determined
by the move from a production economy to an
economy based on consumption, in which
goods are not produced to supply already existing needs, but rather as a secondary response to
needs which are themselves conjured “in the first
place” by advertising and marketing strategies.
David Harvey’s account of the condition of postmodernity proceeds along lines similar in some
respects to those of Bell and Baudrillard, though
with a very different focus and political attitude.
In his The Condition of Postmodernity (1989)
Harvey sees postmodernity as the result of an
intensification of the very energies of transformation and dissolution which had been associated with modern capitalism, energies which, in
assimilating more and more areas of life to the
logic of the marketplace, had caused a radical
undermining of previously stable values, beliefs,
and economic forms. Postmodernity, according
to Harvey’s report, brings about an undermining
of the very forms of social and political organization which had supplanted traditional forms
in Modernity. In place of the clear division
of economic interests between the owners of
capital and those who sell their labor, along with
the clear patterns of social antagonism and identification, and even spatial-geographical forms
brought about by these divisions, the global
economy of postmodernity is characterized by
impermanence of interests, volatility of economic
conditions, insecurity in patterns of employment,
and plurality of class and political identification.
Harvey focuses in particular upon the “space–
time compression” brought about by accelerations
in travel and telecommunications. In a world in
which distance no longer represents any kind of
material constraint upon economic activity, such
that space is measured in the shorter and shorter
intervals of time required to traverse it, space, so

postmodernism

powerful economic corporations are not producers of single, identifying products, but conglomerates, aggregating a set of different and
constantly changing interests and involvements
which traverse the boundaries of nation-states
with ease.
These developments cooperate with the other
principal defining condition of social and economic postmodernity, namely the shift from an
economy based upon goods to one based upon
the supply of information and services. In a
regime of this kind, images and life-styles are as
much the subject of economic marketing and
exploitation as the goods which accompany
them, and indeed, an ever-increasing proportion
of economic activity as a whole is centered on the
generation and circulation of signs and reproductions: news, Texts, films, images, music,
software. Capitalist modernity nursed the fear
that the assimilative hunger of the market might
end up annihilating culture altogether; Fredric
Jameson points to the surprisingly inverse effect
brought about by postmodernity, namely the
“prodigious expansion of culture throughout the
social realm, to the point at which everything in
our social life – from economic value and state
power to practices and to the very structure of the
psyche itself – can be said to have become ‘cultural’” (Jameson, 184, p. 87). Such developments
lead to a move away from the clarity and permanence of affiliations and values in the sphere
of political belief and practice, as a politics based
upon class antagonism gives way to an “identity
politics” based upon a more complex and dispersed
sense of affiliation and power, and an uneven
configuration of sexuality, age, Gender, and
ethnic identity.
There are a number of ways in which postmodernism in the arts is held to reflect or bear
out these changes is the social and economic
sphere. Many writers stress the parallels between
the playful multiplication of styles and mixing
of media characteristic of postmodernist art and
literature and the move from centralization to
decentralization, the sense of accelerated relativity of values, and the dissolution of stable norms
and identities in social and political life generally. In a similar way, an art that pushes selfconsciousness to the extreme, acknowledging
and reveling in its status as fiction or image,

seems appropriate to a world that seems to be
more and more preoccupied with the fashioning
and contemplation of images of itself. Perhaps
the most influential account of the relation
between postmodernism and postmodernity is
that of Jean-François Lyotard in The Postmodern
Condition (1984). Lyotard suggests in that book
that modernity comes into being with the replacement of divine or providential narratives of
human destiny with more secular but no less
universal narratives, or “metanarratives,” which
impart a sense of the irresistible linear progress
of human history toward some singular destination – the achievement of fully self-conscious
“spirit” in Hegelian philosophy, the universal
emancipation of human beings in Marxism. The
postmodern condition comes about with the
collapse of or extreme skepticism toward these
universalizing metanarratives. In place of a
single narrative of the unfolding of an essential
humanity, Lyotard proposes a multiplicity of
different histories and local narratives that is
incapable of being summarized or unified in one
all-encompassing story. Postmodernist art and
culture assist this multiplication of identities
and ways of speaking by resisting every kind
of formalization, and attesting to the sublime
complexity and incommensurability of human
worlds.
For others, however, the very condition of
postmodernity is one in which the relations
between the separate realms of social and economic life on the one hand and art and culture
on the other have undergone a more fundamental transformation. If it is true that there are
powerful parallels between the innovative energies of artistic modernism and the social and
political turbulence of modernity, it is also true
that artistic modernism is often characterized
by its sense of implacable opposition to the
modern world which it inhabits. Seen in this
way, the very smoothness of the interchangeability between postmodernist art and social and
economic postmodernity may seem less like a vital
affinity and more like a collapse of the distance
and differentiation necessary for art and literature
to claim any serious or transforming function. For
proponents of this view, such as Terry Eagleton
(1986), the striking correspondences between
postmodernity and postmodernism are a sign of

571
“working without rules in order to formulate
the rules of what will have been done” (Lyotard,
1984, p. 81).

`post-Soviet studies 
A term that describes
a new approach to literature and Culture in
Russia after the collapse of the Soviet system and
the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the fall
of 1991. However, it must be recognized that
post-Soviet studies originated in the late 1980s,
as they grew directly out of the policy of perestroyka
(restructuring) and glasnost (openness), which
was introduced in 1986 by the former Soviet
premier Mikhail Gorbachev, incorporating the
dissident and unofficial literature and criticism of
the Soviet era. The artists and critics who were
opposed to the Soviet system, and who therefore
were persecuted by it, then formed the mainstream
of post-Soviet studies. The distinction between
studies done at home in the conditions of

post-Soviet studies

the numb and inert compliance of postmodernist art with the forces of commodification.
If one of the important characteristics of the
postmodern condition is the rise of a generalized
self-consciousness in cultural life, then it may
seem fitting that one of the most striking evidences of the condition is the emergence of “the
postmodern” as a style or sensibility within
critical writing itself, such that certain forms of
writing about postmodernism, whether in philosophy, social theory, Cultural studies, or
Literary criticism, come to perform and even
consciously to promote the values or qualities that
are its object. The ambiguity of the phrase “postmodern theory,” which does not allow the senses
of “theory of the postmodern” and “theory as
the postmodern” to be easily distinguished, is
therefore appropriate as well as confusing. If
the postmodern condition is one in which previously separated or opposed areas or forms begin
to merge, then one might indeed expect postmodern theory to come to resemble its object.
Much postmodern writing in philosophy, cultural
studies, and Women’s studies deliberately compromises the clarity of the distinction between
fiction, art, and criticism (just as postmodernist
art often entails highly theoretical reflection
upon its own nature and purpose). Such writing
may refuse to adopt the neutral voice and distanced
perspective that are still conventional in academic writing, forcing acknowledgement of the
situated character of every utterance. It may
offer forms of dialog between cooperating and
competing voices as a polyphonic filling out of
the authoritative closure of the single voice. It may,
as in certain texts by Roland Barthes, such as
his A Lover’s Discourse (1977, trans. 1978) or
Jacques Derrida, such as his Glas (1974, trans.
1986) or “Living on: borderlines” (1979), adopt
some of the techniques of the modernist avantgarde, such as collage and typographical experimentation, to pluralize and complicate the
experience of the reading. Some feminist writers
such as Luce Irigaray, in her Speculum of the
Other Woman (1974, trans. 1984), have sought
in a similar way to generate forms of critical and
theoretical writing that would delegitimize academic authority. Such writing perhaps attempts
to put itself in the place of the postmodernist
avant-garde as defined by Jean-François Lyotard,

constant oppression in opposition to the official
directions of Soviet literature and culture, and
studies of Russian and Soviet literature and culture conducted abroad, where scholars and critics were generally free to express their opinions,
has since lost its significance. There is currently
no separation between official and unofficial
Art and criticism.
The first sign of this change was the publication of previously inaccessible archival materials
and works of authors, critics, and philosophers
suppressed under the Soviet regime. For example,
in 1986 the magazine Ogonyok published a selection of Poetry and a short biographical essay
on the poet Nikolai Gumilev, who was executed
in 1921 on charges of participation in a counterrevolutionary conspiracy. Gumilev was the first
victim of the Soviet regime among Russian
artists. His works were not published in the
Soviet Union, and there had been no attempt at
an analysis of his poetry since the time of his death.
The Gumilev publication opened the floodgates
of publishing activities. At the present time
there are no authors who are banned in Russia.
Works by everyone – from the suppressed Soviet
writers of the 1920s and 1930s like Bulgakov and
Platonov, to old émigré writers like Nabokov
and Merezhkovsky, the third-wave émigré writers
like Aksyonov and Brodsky, the dissidents
Solzhenitzyn and Sinyavsky, Western writers
labeled “modernist” like Proust, Joyce, Kafka,
and Sartre, or those who were considered politically incorrect like Orwell, Musil, and Henry
Miller – are now available.
The publication of previously suppressed materials is coupled with the task of reassessing past
values. Soviet Ideology and the method of
the Socialist realism as a dominating form
of Literary and cultural criticism are firmly
rejected in post-Soviet studies. Having discarded
ideological and methodological baggage, contemporary critics and scholars have undertaken
a broad (if rather chaotic) search for new criteria of evaluation. They see a need to provide a new
interpretation of Russian and Western classical
literature, utilizing new approaches in critical
analysis – from poststructuralism and deconstruction to culturological and mystical philosophical approaches, which are marked by
extreme pluralism in the opinions of the postSoviet critics. This pluralism has replaced the

semantic duality that was one of the most
important aspects of Soviet literature and culture
before the fall of Communism in Russia. Unable
to express their views and opinions openly and
forced at the same time to exist within the Soviet
system, those artists, critics, and scholars who
considered themselves honest and progressive
invented a special Aesopean language to convey
their messages to the reading public. This language
determined a careful selection of verbal material
and presupposed a special attitude toward the
written word, on the part of both the writer and
his/her reader who knew how to read not what
was written, but what was implied in the Text.
Even the period of glasnost was marked by the
duality of thought, by both the dual system of
evaluation and a dual time scale (the wretched,
vulgar, present Soviet time vs. the expected,
genuine, final time associated and identified
with the free, Western world of science, art, and
creative life) and a dual perception of artists and
critics themselves. On the one hand, they were
prophets of the coming new world of freedom,
but on the other hand, the victims of this world
in which they now had to stop solving the problems of culture and country and to earn their
daily bread. In spite of this duality, both the
official and unofficial criticisms were monolithic. The orthodox Soviet critics were united
by the Marxist-Leninist ideology; the opposition
critics were united by the principle that if something did not fit the Procrustean bed of the
official Soviet literature or the method of social
realism, it must be good. This principle in its
reverse form is carried out today: everything
which was created within the framework of the
official Soviet culture is now considered bad.
This typically Russian, indiscriminate rejection
of the entire Soviet culture gives rise to serious
concern on the part of some critics. The refusal
to reevaluate the art of socialist realism is regrettable, not only because its analysis could reveal
most fully the mechanism of totalitarian culture,
but also because it makes impossible any analysis of the unofficial Soviet literature that was
created during that period by “comparing” it
with the official literature.
The liberation from the totalitarian culture
of socialist realism was initially perceived as the
freedom of the word and the spirit, not simply
in the sense of basic human rights but as “a

573
Chudakova (1991, p. 5) correctly pointed out in
her article in Literary Gazette; “for the first time
in nearly two centuries, our society is ceasing
to be literature-centric.” An event taking place
in one sphere of culture is no longer perceived as
having a universal significance; the unity of the
common intellectual reading has disappeared;
the very notion of the intellectual significance
that used to give rhythm to the existence of the
entire class of Soviet intelligentsia is not there
any more. There is no longer a culture-centered
reader, as new classes of readers have appeared.
For example, women have emerged as the main
readers of popular literature, and they have
brought with them new tastes and themes: sex,
love, eroticism, forcing the writers and critics to
make necessary adjustments. Post-Soviet literature
and criticism explore themes that were unthinkable before the fall of Communism in Russia: from
religion and New Age mysticism to eroticism
and sex, and from ethnogenesis and metaphysics
to the absurd and grotesque.
Some critics look in desperation at the present
state of Russian culture, feeling that “the word itself
is dying and losing its old passion and strength;
the great Word of literature, which traditionally
has been an organic part of the spiritual life, has
been that life itself” (Selivanova, 1993, p. 44). The
leading dissident writer of the 1960s and 1970s,
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, sees the contemporary
state of Russian culture as a catastrophe which,
in his opinion, has resulted from the amorphousness of Russian national consciousness,
from the indifference towards one’s own nationality. Salvation can be found only in developing
the feeling of patriotism, which Solzhenitsyn
defines as follows: “Patriotism is a whole and
persistent feeling of love towards your homeland
and your nation combined with your service
for her” (Solzhenitsyn, 1994, p. 174). The writer,
V. Rasputin, also sees the only solution to the
present spiritual bankruptcy to be the revival of
the sense of nationalism based on religious faith.
Many scholars entering post-Soviet studies from
previous decades lament the general decline
and impoverishment of humanistic culture in
Russia; the reason for which they see in the
interruption of cultural traditions and traditions of “Holy Russia” in particular. As the only
panacea for national spiritual revival, they suggest
the return to teaching Scripture and Russian

post-Soviet studies

re-creation of the world” and “a reinterpretation
of destinations” (Aitmatov, 1993, p. 11). However,
with the disintegration of the totalitarian regime,
“the conflict between the spirit and power,”
which constituted the most important theme
of the Soviet epoch and had almost universal
significance for the Soviet creative world, disappeared as well. Artists had to take the freedom
test; and many failed it, being unable to write for
and not against something.
The collapse of the state system of control and
support of the arts has been another factor that
contributes to the crisis keenly felt in post-Soviet
culture. The physical state of post-Soviet studies
is extremely difficult. Many critical literary journals have closed, owing to the lack of funds and
the decline of interest on the part of the general
public. Furthermore, there are neither new institutions nor other mechanisms of support for the
humanities and the arts. The critics who grew
accustomed to existing contrary to and at the
same time within the limits of the Soviet socialist structure of culture are now forced to compete with commercial publications in a struggle
that they feel they are losing. Critics exist mostly
by publishing their works in a handful of the
remaining thick journals, such as Novy Mir (New
World), which have Western sponsors, or by
finding a way to travel and teach in Western
universities. Genuine literature is inexorably
losing its position, giving way to a surrogate
of cheap books and mass culture, particularly of
American exports. Very much in the spirit of
Western Liberalism, in place of the faith in the
might of the word comes repressive tolerance
(Kagarlitsky, 1993, p. 132).
Post-Soviet studies are also marked by a radical
change in relationships between the artist or
critic and his/her reader, and in the perception
of the artist by the Russian public. In Russia
historically, literature and literary criticism had
always been more than just a form of art. For centuries they were a forum for discussion of “life
and death questions,” and the Russian reading
public always looked to literature for answers,
viewing writers and critics as teachers of life.
Now in the conditions of absolute freedom, “the
writer and belle lettres have lost their formerly
sacrosanct status, that certain halo of the righteous”
(Aitmatov, 1993, p. 14) as the public begins to view
literature purely as entertainment. As Marietta

Orthodox Ethics. Scholars, like the academician
Likhachev, call for the Russian people to confront their own history, which is perceived as
an equivalent to personal national repentance.
Critics of this inclination see in this striving
towards historical knowledge of the recent past a
solution to the national tragedy.
Unfortunately, they do not realize that the
new generation of Russian intellectuals perceive
Scripture, religion, and cultural traditions quite
differently. The Scriptures, which were used and
studied in secret under the Soviet regime, have now
become the source of remaking and sacrilege.
The unrepentant society and especially its intellectual elite have chosen alternative paths in
finding the “national myth,” which would explain the historical concreteness of their actions.
Instead of restoring ties to traditional Russian religious culture, contemporary writers and critics
throw a bridge to the lost traditions of modernism. They substitute for the sacred, historical,
cultural space (Likhachev, 1994) a nonexistent
one that reflects the predominant theme of the
post-Soviet culture – the conviction that in contemporary Russian society people live in a country where nothing has meaning for anyone.
We must remember that with the end of socialist realist art, modernism, which was the alternative to the official culture in Russia, ended as well.
It has been replaced with Postmodernism,
which forms the first of the two major divisions
of post-Soviet studies. Today’s creators of
postmodernist literature are yesterday’s Soviet
underground. While they were underground,
the artists and critics believed they were composing
a literature of truth to offset the programmed
official lie. That underground has now surfaced
and has collided with a reality which is so complex and contradictory and, moreover, changing
with such speed, that the constant battle with
socialist realism has turned out to be simply
absurd. Postmodernist literature and criticism
reflect a deep intellectual crisis. They recreate
a deconstructed, paradoxical world which contradicts normal moral instincts and from which
the primary human subject has disappeared. In
an attempt to think in universal categories, postSoviet criticism in the form of postmodernism has
entered an abstract, speculative, utopian space
where humans with their character, will, and
motives are turned into an abstraction.

The perception of contemporary reality in
Russian postmodernism can be defined by the
title of Milan Kundera’s novel, The Unbearable
Lightness of Being, which leads to perceiving as
“unbearably light” all old absolutes and authorities (both ideological and ontological, universal
and personal) which were previously unshakable. Postmodernism expresses the tragic state of
the world, which is perceived as an escape from
the turn of history, and itself can be called “the
end of history,” beyond which one could expect
the return and rebirth of the human soul in the
forgotten, lost, universal history of personality.
The mission of postmodernism in Russia could
be defined as that of Charon transporting the
“dear shadows” into the land of the dead.
The best manifestation of postmodernism in
Russia is conceptualism. Originating in the linguistic experiments of futurists, conceptualists
have arrived at a totally different vision, although
perfectly fitting the contemporary life; instead
of the futurists’ “beyonsense” language of higher
reality, we encounter the deliberate misarticulation and linguistic Alienation of the conceptualists. As Mikhail Epstein correctly points out:
“The conceptual treatment of language leaves
us in a space of tense silence, of the decay and
decrepitude of all existing or possible words –
in a kind of nirvana of discarded sign systems
and absolute, extrasubjective, extralinguistic
meaning-conjecture” (Epstein, 1993, p. 265).
Such an approach to the representation of
reality is charged with a final eschatological meaning. Conceptualism separates signifiers from the
signified and demonstrates the transparency and
illusory quality of the latter (Epstein, p. 265).
An alternative to conceptualism is a new realism or more properly, postrealism. Postrealism is
characterized, on the one hand, by the belief on
the part of its creators in real existence of higher
spiritual entities and by the desire to attract the
reader to them; and, on the other hand, by an
attempt at a synthesis of the traditional, ideological view of the world and the subjective, personal,
individual sphere.
Postrealism is a method based on the principle
of relativity understood in universal terms,
according to which the constantly changing
world is perceived dialogically through the total
openness of an author’s position toward the universe. Thus postrealism becomes an “existential

575
her people. According to him, it consists not
of “some special political, economic or social
structures,” but of the fact that the Russian
people possess this gift of Atlantis, the universal
logos consisting of three letters. By penetrating into
the depths of this universal logos, Russia will
be able to accomplish the true coup in human history: to leave the technocratic path of the development of civilization, the path designed for
satisfaction of immediate, transient needs, and to
enter the logocratic path, the path of exploring
inner, essential, constant values. Russia’s task is
to follow this path and to lead all humanity
along it.
In the post-Soviet reality, postrealism fulfills
the cosmogonical function of creation of a new
myth. To offset the frightening chaos of modernism, socialist realism established its totalitarian
cosmos, which did not allow any deviations
from the Canon and in which there was no freedom of thought, no pathos of discoveries; but it
provided the fatalistic optimism that guaranteed
happiness in the end. Postmodernism, asserting
that culture is chaos, established complex cultural
poetics in which a living person with his/her
pains and destinies turns out to be replaced
by a bunch of mutually exclusive associations.
Postrealism completes the culturological work
of postmodernism. It attempts to comprehend
chaos through a person and for the sake of a person, and thus to find a teleological connection,
which may become the purpose and justification
of a singular human life surrounded on all sides
by the attributes of chaos. Out of chaos postrealism restores the cosmos, which rediscovers the
wholeness of the world in its discreteness, the unity
and stability in the repulsion of opposites, the balance in the very process of endless movement,
and creates a dialogue of the opposing elements
which does not reconcile cosmos and chaos but
harmonizes chaos (Leiderman and Lipovetsky,
1993, p. 238).

realism,” since it is based on “the faith without
a faith.” Mikhail Bakhtin is perceived as a
founder of the Aesthetics of postrealism, the
relative aesthetics that proposes a view of the
world as an eternally changing, liquid entity in
which there are no distinctions between top and
bottom, eternal and transient, existence and nonexistence. “Meta-realism is a poetics of homogeneous, indivisible unfolding of a multifaceted
reality, where, for the sake of observing a theocentric world structure, the lyrical ‘I’ gives way to
lyrical ‘it’” (Epstein, p. 263). The search for the
meaning of life is transferred into “The life of
insects” (the title of Viktor Pelevin’s story), and
hope for the future is realized through the discussion of suicide (M. Butov’s story “In memory
of the suicide Seva”). As a critic, Irina Rodnyanskaya writes that the paradox of the contemporary literary situation consists of the fact that
“the most humanistic prose is from the life of
insects, and the most optimistic is about ‘unmotivated’ suicide” (Rodnyanskaya, 1993, p. 227).
Postrealism returns to the traditional Russian
perception of literature as a teacher of life. The
pronouncements of some post-Soviet critics
and writers by inertia go far beyond the strictly
literary analysis and often acquire a “prophetic
urgency.” Thus an analysis of an individual
literary work grows into a meditation on the
present state or the future path of Russian society. For example, in a recent essay entitled “The
third path, or the priceless gift of Atlantis. An
attempt at the newest philosophical-polyclinical
studies,” postrealist critic A. Andreev analyzes
“the word well-known to all strata of population
which defines . . . the male life-giving organ.”
Proceeding from the fact that this word in
Russian is composed of three letters, which came
to the Russian language from the Greek “x,”
“y,” and “twice rotated in the three-dimensional
space Latin ‘z’” and which, according to the
author, constitutes the gift of Atlantis to the
Russian civilization, he, in absolute seriousness,
deduces that this triad represents “the three axes,
three coordinates, three vectors” which determine the structure of the universe. Thus the
word consisting of these three letters becomes
the universal logos, which explains the special
mentality of the Russian people, their innate
attraction to the eternal. In his conclusion, the
author defines the messianic idea of Russia and

`poststructuralism 
A general term in the
history of late twentieth-century thought that
is used to designate, often dismissively, a wide
range of discrete thinkers, including Barthes,
Deleuze, de Man, Derrida, Foucault,
Girard, and Said. The word was coined to refer
to the intellectual movements that emerged from
the International Colloquium on Critical Languages and the Sciences of Man, which was held
at Johns Hopkins University in 1966. Perhaps the
most influential paper delivered at that conference was Derrida’s “Structure, sign, and play in
the discourse of the human sciences,” which was
subsequently published in the proceedings of the
conference (The Structuralist Controversy) and
as a chapter in Writing and Difference, with an
important epigraph from Mallarmé’s Un Coup de
dés that anticipates post-structuralism.
Although Derrida does not use the word “poststructuralism,” his essay offers the best opening
into the concept. An important event has taken

place in the concept of structure, he announces,
(see Structuralism). Acknowledging that it
may seem strange to use the word “event” in relation to Structure he nevertheless proceeds to
show that a rupture has occurred in this concept
and in its history. Structure, as word and concept,
is as old as Western science and philosophy.
Indeed, it is so much a part of the root network
of ordinary language and thought that it is easy
to forget its metaphorical character. In this forgetfulness bred of excessive familiarity, “the
structurality of structure” (Derrida, 1978, p. 278)
has been neutralized; and it has been allowed to
assume a center point of presence, and fixed origin in language and thought. This has been done
to limit the Play of structure. Structure, especially
the center of a structure, keeps play within limits, however. The center operates as a metaphor
within the metaphor of structure. It works to
close off play and does not allow for substitution, permutation, or transformation. The center
is that which is unique in a given structure.
Although center governs structure, it is not
structured in turn. The center is a still presence
from which the attempt may be made to conceive
of structure itself as “a full presence which is
beyond play” (p. 279). The entire history of
the concept of structure, however, manifests
the substitutions of one center for another or the
assignment of different forms or names to the
center, such as “the Word” for “God.” To think
through the structurality of structure in this way
– to recognize center and presence as metaphors
– is not to do violence to the structure of language
or the structure of a given text. On the contrary,
it is to be aware of what structure is and has been;
it is to reflect on “a central presence which has
never been itself, has always already been exiled
from itself into its own substitute” (p. 280). At
such moments of critical reflection as this,
language ceases to be a transparent medium of
reflection or the undifferentiated substance of
thought; it now becomes part of the universal
problematic. Poststructuralism therefore is not an
abandonment of structure but rather a critical
reflection upon its dynamics. It neither brings
philosophy to an end (see End of philosophy)
nor attempts to work outside of philosophy.
While systematically opposing rigid, oppressive,
and monolithic structure, poststructuralism is
not an invitation to irresponsible formlessness.

`Poulet, Georges (1902–91) 
Critic of the
Geneva school. Born in Belgium, influenced
by Marcel Raymond, Arthur Lovejoy, and
Gaston Bachelard, Poulet taught in Edinburgh,
Baltimore, Zürich, and Nice, while developing an
analytic approach that emphasizes categories of
space and time as keys to understanding literary
Texts, and the coordination of these categories
to reconstruct an implied author’s identity or
cogito, that is, the Cartesian “I think” that represents an individual act of consciousness. Poulet’s
brilliantly seductive Literary criticism has also
been controversial because it marshals evidence
from an author’s complete writings without

recognizing either context or the unity of individual works. Rejecting formal structures and
critical objectivity, he correlates key words to
define a characteristic organizing consciousness that persists throughout each writer’s entire
work. His Studies in Human Time (1949–68)
describe the spiritual careers of authors from the
Renaissance to the twentieth century, prefacing
them with a larger “history of human consciousness” that outlines, century by century, the
evolution of concepts of existence. Later books
consider individual authors (Proustian Space,
1963) and literary critics (The Critical Consciousness, 1971). Key phrases are “interior distance,”
the mental universe projected by the Text; foyer,
a generating core or starting point unique to
each author’s experience; and “criticism of consciousness” or “criticism of identification,” the critical attempt to reproduce in oneself the author’s
mode of experience. Poulet’s approach is the
obverse of Deconstruction: he emphasizes
cogito, not Parole; person, not language; and
manifold constructions of presence, not traceries
of deferral and absence.

`practical criticism 
The critical method originating from I.A. Richards’s Practical Criticism
(1929), a work recording a teaching experiment
at Cambridge in which students were asked to
analyze unidentified Texts.
In its broad sense, practical criticism is thus
synonymous with “close reading” or the French
explication de texte. But, historically, it came to
mean something much more specific and contentious, the New Critical doctrine of “intrinsic”
analysis which encouraged students to read a

practical criticism

Instead, poststructuralist critique celebrates the
liberating potential within human forms and
accepts the responsibility of reflecting upon them.
In this respect it is a kind of critical reading that
champions Writing, although its procedures
can be extended, at least by analogy, to all
human activities.
Poststructuralism is often loosely and misleadingly equated with Postmodernism or identified
exclusively with Deconstruction in support of
the erroneous claim that poststructuralists are
unified enemies of meaning and truth. The most
ambitious effort of this sort is Manfred Frank’s
What Is Neostructuralism? which attempts to
reduce French poststructuralism to antirationalism and to oppose it to German rationalism. The
publication of Textual Strategies: Perspectives
in Post-Structuralist Criticism (1979) made poststructuralist thought widely available to American
and British readers, while serving as an important correction to the assumption that there is
a single definition or essence that constitutes
poststructuralist practice.

this would mean asking the reader to interpret
Milton’s “When I consider how my light is

Practical criticism has been widely criticized not
only for being unhistorical, and for depending
on an indefensible ideal of the autonomous
text, but also for focusing too exclusively on the
purely verbal aspects of literature and neglecting
other elements, such as patterns of action in
drama or Plots in novels, which also determine
meaning.

`Prague Linguistic Circle 
For two decades
the Prague Linguistic Circle charted the course
of modern linguistic and literary studies. The
morphological and phonological theories of current generative linguistics as well as the central
notions of modern Semiotics are direct legacies
of the circle.
The first meeting of the Prague Circle was
held in the office of Vilém Mathesius at Charles
University on October 6, 1926 to discuss a paper
read earlier that day by Henrik Becker. In
addition to Becker and Mathesius, that initial
gathering included the anglicist Bohumil Trnka,
the slavists Roman Jakobson and Bohuslav
Havránek, and the orientalist Jan Rypka. The
meeting ended on a general note of agreement
that the group should meet regularly to develop
a new agenda of language study. Although
Mathesius is considered the founder of the
Prague Circle, Jakobson, a former member of the

Moscow Linguistic Circle, shaped it and steered
its course for nearly two decades.
While Saussure was a major influence on
the research program of the Prague Circle, the
brand of Structuralism which emerged from
the Prague Circle was distinct from that of the
Geneva school set afoot by Saussure. In his
first address to the circle, Jakobson argued
against Saussure’s position that language studies
completely divorce synchronic and diachronic
analyses since synchronic phonology can be
fully explained only in terms of diachronic processes currently under way in a given language.
Jakobson and his colleagues were also attracted
by the new concepts of the “phoneme” (smallest
distinctive linguistic element of sound) and
“morpheme” (smallest meaningful linguistic
element), introduced by Baudouin de Courtenay
and Nikolai Kruszewski. Before arriving in
Prague, Jakobson was convinced that studying
individual sounds in isolation was pointless;
rather, individual sounds (phonemes) must be
studied in terms of the patterns they form within
a given language. This led him to his notion of
“contrast.” Linguistic sounds constitute morphemes (stems and affixes) whose function is
to convey distinctive meanings. To accomplish
this, morphemes and ultimately phonemes must
contrast with one another. If two phonemes
do not contrast, say, as /t/ and /d/ do in English,
they cannot discriminate meaningful elements,
as /t/ and /d/ (alone) distinguish the two words
tip and dip. The system of contrasts, based on
distinctive properties like vocal vibration, position
of the tongue, and nasality, form the patterns of
sounds in languages.
Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy, who joined
the group in 1928, also developed the distinction
between purely phonological rules, conditioned
by phonological (sound) phenomena alone,
and morpho(pho)phonological rules, which are
sound variations conditioned by morphological
phenomena. This distinction with all its implications remains fundamental to the all contemporary theories of linguistics. Trubetzkoy’s
monograph on the subject, published posthumously in 1939, laid the foundation for that
distinction as well as Jakobson’s later work on
distinctive phonological features.
That new linguistic agenda was presented to the
First International Congress of Linguists which

579
extended far beyond individual works. Beyond
the structure of any single work of art was the
structure of that genre of art itself, and beyond
that, the structure of art itself. Literary theory
and, ultimately, all aesthetic theory, must take a
work of art in the context of all the internal and
external relations within this hierarchy.
The Prague Circle saw linguistic and poetic
structuralism cut from the same bolt. Since
language turns on the classic linguistic sign, an
indissoluble association of Symbol and meaning,
in the 1930s the Prague school began to interpret
all art in terms of signs. This notion provided
further proof that form could not be studied
aside from content and led Mukar̆ovský and
Jakobson to the works of the Russian philosopher
Mikhail Bakhtin and Charles S. Pierce. The
combination of these various threads of thought
led to the semiotic theories of the Prague Circle,
which directly molded the Eastern and Western
Europe schools of semiotics.
The activity of the circle diminished rapidly after
the sudden rise of the Communist Party to
power in Czechoslovakia in 1948. By that time
Jakobson and Wellek had moved on to the
United States and Mathesius and Trubetzkoy
had both passed away. Attempts in the 1950s
and 1980s to revive the circle never achieved the
intellectual heights of the original organization.

Prague Linguistic Circle

convened in The Hague in April of 1928. The
circle’s Phonological Theses were signed by
Jakobson, Trubetzkoy, and Sergei Karcevskij and
published in the proceedings of the Congress
along with the Program of Linguistics Analysis,
signed by Jakobson, Mathesius, and Trubetzkoy,
as well as the editors of Saussure’s Cours générale
linguistique, Charles Bally and Albert Séchehaye.
The initial meeting of the Congress thus served
as the catalyst of the European structuralist
school of linguistics, since it was the Prague
Circle and the Geneva school, later joined by the
Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen, which defined
the basic program of structuralism, the precursor of modern generative linguistic theory.
The following year the first International
Congress of Slavists convened in Prague and the
circle was actively engaged in its preparations. By
this time its members had developed a rounded
program of language study, which it presented
to the Congress as another set of theses. These
theses cast a totally new light on the issues
of phonology, the newly delineated area of
morphophonology, morphology, syntax, and
lexicography. They also addressed questions of
linguistic geography and language standardization. The first two issues of the circle’s journal,
Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Prague, were also
presented to the Congress. It would continue to
have an enormous impact on linguistics and
poetics until its demise in 1939.
The early ties with the Moscow Circle were
underscored in 1928 when two of its outstanding members, Boris Tomashevsky and
Yuri Tynyanov, spoke before the Prague Circle.
The Moscow Circle was closely associated with
Formalism and its notion that the study of Art
be restricted to the inner laws of the work alone
without reference to external facts. The idea that
a literary work could be understood in isolation
from its milieu, ignoring its historical legacy, was
as foreign to the thinking of the Prague Circle
as the notion that linguistic sounds could be
analyzed in isolation. Jan Mukar̆ovský played the
cardinal role in developing the literary positions
of the circle, although Jakobson and, later, René
Wellek contributed handsomely. These three
and their colleagues accorded structure a central position in their theories of art but a richer
endowment than had the formalists. Mukar̆ovský felt that structure was hierarchical and

(Heidegger, 1927). The idea was implicit in what
Husserl called predelineation (Vorzeichnung).

The phrase derives
from an essay on the subject authored by French
social theorist Emile Durkheim and Marcel

The authors asked: how and why do human
beings classify their social and physical world?
Their answer, exhaustively critiqued by Needham in his introduction to the 1963 English
translation, is mainly of historical interest. In the
years since, however, the analysis of indigenous
classification systems has blossomed: how societies classify such domains as kinsmen, flora and
fauna, medicines and illness, supernatural entities, and the color spectrum, and what principles
underlie those classifications, have stimulated
elegant and fruitful analyses.

`Propp, Vladimir (1895–1970) 
A Russian
formalist most famous for his structural analysis
of the Russian folk tale (1968), Propp can be
considered an important influence on the
development of Narratology, especially with
regard to work on plot composition.
The impetus behind Propp’s work was similar
to that of Structuralism. He was interested in
finding the rules which were fundamental to the
folk tale. His work on plot was based upon that

of Veselovsky, who saw plots as subdivided into
“motifs.” Propp expanded this formulation, analyzing them in terms of “roles” which constitute
the character types, and the functions by and
through which characters act out the story,
effectively creating the plot sequence. For Propp
all folk tales consisted of variations upon this
basic structure. He isolated four basic classes of
folk tale: those concerned with success at the
end of a long struggle; those concerned with the
successful conclusion of a difficult task; those
concerned with both of these classes; and those
concerned with neither. Such broad divisions are
of course open to question, and it is this fact which
has proven so fruitful in the structuralist attempt
to produce a science of narration. The reason for
this is that Propp’s analytical method has proven
to be most attractive to structuralists precisely
because in one crucial particular it matches one
of the fundamental premises of structuralism
itself. This aspect is Propp’s attempt to reduce the
heterogeneous richness of the folk tale to a fundamental set of rules. These rules form a sort
of “deep structure” which can be discerned in all
folk tales in his equivalent of the structuralist
assumption that, ultimately, a structural homology rooted in the human mind is responsible for
narrative. Such a position offerred structuralists
interested in narrative a model which allowed them
not only to compare different narratives, but
also to read all narratives as the surface results of
a single imperative. Nevertheless Propp cannot
be considered to be a fully fledged structuralist
of this kind since he did not develop a
Metalanguage of his own in which to conceptualize his analyses. This remained for those who
followed his method but who perhaps found it
to be insufficiently couched in scientistic terminology. Propp generalized at the points at which later
narratologists move onto different conceptual
levels. Thus he tended to analyze the incidents
which interested him in the same kind of language
employed by the Texts he read and it was this
methodology which was to be supplanted in the
work of structuralists such as Claude Bremond.
Accordingly, it has been argued by Fredric
Jameson (1989) that Propp therefore organized
his material into a single overriding narrative
which subsumes all of the folk tale narratives
he analyzed. It is this which constitutes a problem for structuralists, who wish to achieve an

`psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism 
In an encyclopedia article written in 1922,
Freud (1922, p. 235) supplies a lucid description
of the discipline he founded. Psychoanalysis is,
he writes, the name given to “a procedure for
the investigation of mental processes which are
almost inaccessible in any other way.” It is a
therapeutic method for the treatment of neurotic
disorders. Finally, it is a body of psychological data
“which is gradually being accumulated into a
new scientific discipline.”
Although it was developed primarily as a
clinical method for the treatment of individuals,
Freud’s new scientific discipline has always had
a variety of other applications. Freud (1913)
described it as having claims to scientific interest
which made the psychoanalytic method extensible to nonclinical disciplines as diverse as philology, biology, sociology, and education, as well as
to the science of Aesthetics. His professed
aversion to totalizing philosophies and systembuilding notwithstanding, Freud was always
prone to the most wide-ranging speculations,
and the literary-artistic domain was in his view
one which came within the remit of psychoanalysis. Freud’s Writings abound in literary
allusions and references, mainly to classical
German authors such as Goethe and Schiller.
There is a certain Irony here in that whereas Freud
is often seen as one of the cardinal thinkers of the
modern, his own tastes remain resolutely classical and traditional.
Freud believed that the writer and psychoanalyst draw on the same or similar sources, and that
intuition is endorsed by Lacan when he remarks
(Lacan, 1965, p. 9) that Marguerite Duras
“knows without me what I teach” and that the
writer “precedes” the analyst. Literary models

have had a productive role in the history of
psychoanalysis. The early “cathartic method”
of therapy (Breuer and Freud, 1893–5; see
Freud) contains an obvious allusion to classical
theories of tragic drama and the theory of the
Oedipus complex itself originates in memories
of Sophocles and Greek mythology. One of the
reasons that Freud was so attracted to Jensen’s
Gradiva, a “Pompeian fantasy” published in 1903,
was no doubt that it can be read as a psychiatric
study which describes the return of the repressed,
for the hero’s infatuation with a sculpture proves
to derive from repressed childhood memories
(Freud, 1907). The manner in which Freud
applies his method of dream interpretation to the
dreams and delusions of Jensen’s fictional character reveals, however, one of the characteristic
weaknesses of classical psychoanalytic criticism,
namely its surrender to the realist fallacy and its
inability to recognize the materiality of the Text.
There is no challenge to an unproblematically
mimetic view of the expressive correspondence
between Text and author, text and reality or
even character and reality.
A number of Freud’s papers are devoted to
aesthetic topics. These range from studies of
fiction (1919, 1927), of Shakespeare (1913), and
of Dostoievsky (1927) to two major essays on
the visual arts (1910, 1914a) and to briefer but
more general considerations on creative writing
(1908). In general, Freud displays little interest in
the formal properties of the works he discusses
and is less concerned with the science of aesthetics than with the psychology of creativity and
the psychopathology of creative artists. As Freud
(1914b, p. 36) himself puts it, psychoanalysis
moves “from the interpretation of dreams to the
analysis of works of imagination and ultimately
to the analysis of their creators.”
Artistic creativity is usually seen as a parallel with
the fantasy activity of the child. At the most basic
level, fiction provides a form of wish fulfillment
for both author and, thanks to the mechanisms
of identification, reader. Thus, stories in which
women readily fall in love with a first-person
hero are readily recognizable as a form of ego
gratification (Freud, 1908). Most psychoanalytic
criticism relies to a degree upon the theory of sublimation, or the diversion of the sexual instinct
toward nonsexual aims. The classical examples are
artistic creation and intellectual inquiry, which is

psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism

objective science of narrative. In any event,
Propp’s analysis came at the moment of a shift
in theories of literature: he enacted a movement
away from readings which operate in terms of
simple representation.

psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism

582
often seen as a sublimation of the sexual curiosity of childhood. The theory of sublimation
provides, for example, the metapsychological
underpinnings for the Leonardo essay (Freud,
1910). Sublimation is not, however, the most
coherent notion in Freud’s metapsychology,
being partly a metaphor drawn from chemistry
(where it refers to the vaporization of a solid
without the intermediate formation of a liquid)
and partly an allusion to an aesthetics of the sublime, and its mechanisms are never described by
Freud with any great clarity. While sublimation
is held to be a basic property of the aesthetic, Freud
is also forced to admit that there is something
unknowable about creativity and accepts in his discussion of Dostoievsky that “Before the problem
of the creative artist, analysis must lay down its
arms” (1928, p. 177). To that extent, Freud is still
clinging to a romantic notion of genius.
Classical psychoanalytic criticism is an author
and content-based criticism based mainly upon
thematic readings. As a theorist of Objectrelations puts it, Freud’s writings about Art
and literature deal with “general psychological
problems expressed in works of art and shows,
for instance, how the latent content of universal
infantile anxieties is symbolically expressed in
them” (Segal, 1952, p. 185). Given that psychoanalysis operates with a fairly small number of
Symbols, most of them pertaining to the
Oedipal triangle and its effects, its application
to the literary domain can be very reductive.
Biography tends to be the dominant mode of
classical psychoanalytic criticism, the protoptype
being Freud’s study of Leonardo da Vinci. Here,
Freud seeks to demonstrate that both the artist’s
sexuality and his works relate to the childhood
memory or fantasy of a bird opening his lips
with its tail (an image of both suckling and passive oral intercourse; the enigmatic smile of the
Mona Lisa is read as an emblem of the satisfaction obtained from both activities). Freud claims
to rediscover that motif in Leonardo’s most
famous paintings. Freud was extremely fond of
his “analytic novel,” but it is fatally flawed by
reliance upon inaccurate material. Freud believed
he was writing about a vulture – a bird with rich
mythological connotations relating to the maternal image – but was using a faulty translation.
Leonardo’s bird was in fact a banal kite, a bird
quite devoid of mythological importance.

Marie Bonaparte’s study of the life and work
of Edgar Allan Poe is a good example of analytic
psychobiography (Bonaparte, 1933). The Tales,
which are grouped by Bonaparte into “cycles” centered upon maternal and paternal figures, are
seen as providing an equivalent to the Manifest
content of a dream; analytic interpretation
of them can supply the Latent content. The
latent content is then related back to the known
biographical data to produce an exercise in psychobiography. Thus “The purloined letter” is
read in terms of the author’s identification with
the Minister, representing a hated but feared
father and illustrating the author’s nostalgia for
a maternal phallus. The result is a characteristic
combination of an investigation of the individual artist’s psyche and a search for supposed
universals. A certain circularity is inevitable as
biographical details are pressed into service to
confirm the analytic interpretation. In a much
briefer study, Hanna Segal (1952, p. 190) interprets the whole of A la Recherche du temps perdu
as a product of Proust’s acute awareness that “all
creation is really a re-creation of a once loved and
once whole, but now lost and ruined world and
self,” and concludes that the wish to create is
rooted in the depressive position and the wish to
make reparation to the ruined object.
A much more sophisticated version of psychobiography is provided by Charles Mauron’s
“psychocriticism” (1954; a good Englishlanguage account is given in Bersani, 1984), which
is influenced by both Freudian and Kleinian
models. Racine’s plays and career are interpreted
in terms of maternal and paternal imagos. Thus,
the Oedipal love object of the theater is a counterbalance to the cruel mother of Jansenism
and its austere mysticism. Racine eventually
renounces the stage, and the Jansenist mother
figure is victorious over the weak king figure
with whom the playwright attempts to identify.
Racine’s theater is ultimately a failed attempt to
make the transition from an obsessional relation
with the mother to a classic Oedipal pattern.
Although Mauron does rely upon a psychobiographical framework, his ability to combine an
exemplary close reading of Racine and analytic
insight allows him to avoid the more crudely
reductive aspects of the genre, and to reveal
patterns of desire that provide an effective
basis for a formal textual organization. Critic

metaphors for unconscious conflicts, and illustrating strategies for negotiating problems like
aggression, sexuality, and death. More recently,
the object-relations approach adopted by Margaret and Michael Rustin (1987) has resulted
in an attractive study of the construction of
fantasies and internal objects in children’s literature which successfully combines analytic and
sociologial insights.
While traditional psychoanalytic criticism
continues to be written, it is often held in poor
regard by critics influenced by the general trends
within modern literary theory and by the broad
movement from Formalism to Structuralism
and Poststructuralism. The death of the
Author, as proclaimed by Barthes and
Foucault, has undercut the support for traditional psychobiography (though it is important
to note that Bloom’s schema requires the revival
of the author) and few professional critics
would now adopt Bonaparte’s “life and works”
approach. Increasingly the emphasis is placed
upon the text, its operations and its productivity, rather than on the author, while characterological studies have been largely eclipsed.
The interdisciplinarity of modern literary
studies makes it increasingly difficult to speak of
psychoanalytic criticism as such. Psychoanalysis
is now part of a wide tissue of Intertextuality, taking in Derrida’s Deconstructionist
dialogs with Freud, mingling with strands of
Feminist criticism and the work of theorists
like Kristeva, and merging, in the work of
Macherey, with Althusser’s Marxism to
generate symptomatic readings of the silences
of literary texts which attempt to uncover an
ideological Unconscious.
Recent psychoanalytic criticism tends to be
influenced primarily by Lacan and to stem
originally from French sources. A major stage in
the introduction of these developments into
the Anglo-American sphere was the appearance
of the important issue of Yale French Studies
(no. 55–56, 1977), edited by Felman and devoted
to “Literature and psychoanalysis. The question
of reading: otherwise.” Lacan himself remains
surprisingly close to traditional psychoanalytic
views and often simply appropriates literary
texts for the defense and illustration of psychoanalytic theory. Hamlet, for instance, is seen by
Lacan as illustrating “a decadent form of the

psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism

and playwright are particularly well matched
in that the very formal and repetitive nature of
Racinian tragedy lends itself well to a search for
a restricted number of Symbols, while the classical concentration on the passions is eminently
amenable to an analysis of the fluctuations of
desire.
Other variants on classical psychoanalytic
criticism adopt a slightly different approach and
successfully exploit other areas of Freud’s oeuvre.
The French critic Marthe Robert (1972) skillfully
mines the short paper on “Family romance”
(Freud, 1909) to produce a broad narrative
typology and even an account of the desire to write
fiction. Freud uses “family romance” to refer to
the Oedipal fantasies in which children construct
a different relationship with their parents, imagining that they are the offspring, not of their real
father and mother, but of kings and queens, or
warding off sibling rivalry with fantasies that
their brothers and sisters are illegitimate. Robert
applies this fantasy structure to Robinson Crusoe
and Don Quixote, viewed as prototypical novels,
and constructs a typology of bastard and foundling, of fictional structures based respectively
on the self-creation of the hero and the omnipotence of wishes. A very different typology, but one
which again relates Oedipal structures to literary structures, is supplied by Harold Bloom’s
thesis about poetry and the anxiety of influence (Bloom, 1984). The anxiety of influence is
seen as an equivalent to the experience of the
Uncanny; the young poet comes to recognize in
his work the influence of precursors with whom
he must wrestle in order to emerge as a “strong
poet” capable of absorbing and creating his precursors without dying as a poet. Tradition is
likened to the repressed material in the psychic
life of individuals, and relations between poetic
generations as a form of Transference. Bloom’s
Freud is a very literary figure, cast in the role of
a strong poet.
Given the emphasis of psychoanalysis on the
importance of childhood memories and experiences, which are obviously relevant to both
Robert and Bloom, it is strange that so little
analytic writing is devoted to children’s literature,
though this may simply reflect the traditional
neglect of the genre. A signal exception is

tales as depicting stages of development and

Oedipus situation, its decline” (1959, p. 45), while
Poe’s “Purloined letter,” which has become
a locus classicus for Lacanian literary theory, is
read as an allegory of the workings of letter and
signifier.
Lacan has, however, undoubtedly been the
major influence in the emergence of a new
psychoanalytic approach to the literary domain,
thanks largely to his foregrounding of the cultural
and symbolic function of language, his hints at a
poetics of a linguistically structured unconscious
which is as adept at rhetoric as any poet. The stress
on reading in the proposed “return to Freud”
also has an obvious appeal to those trained in
the literary traditions of close reading and
Hermeneutics. One of the less happy aspects of
the critical appropriation of Lacan has been the
emergence of an almost purely literary version
of psychoanalysis which is increasingly divorced
from the clinically based work of practicing
analysts. There is also a tendency to reduce the
history of psychoanalysis to the work of Freud and
Lacan, and to ignore the broader tradition.
Freud’s psychoanalysis has also become part of
literary Discourse. Felman reads his work on
transference in parallel with the fiction of Henry
James, while Cixous (1976) literally stages psychoanalysis in an emotionally powerful dramatization of the Dora case (Freud, 1905), which
is in part a feminist interrogation of psychoanalysis. The effects of this breaking down of genre
boundaries can also be seen at the level of critical
discourse. Increasingly, the emphasis is placed
upon “theoretical fictions” as very broad definitions of textuality and discourse tend to eliminate
almost all reference to the extratextual or social
dimension. Sarah Kofman, who is heavily influenced by Derrida’s deconstuctionism, detects
a parallel between Freud’s analytic constructs
and the delusions of his patients, and strongly
endorses Freud’s self-deprecating description of
his science as being no more than a provisional
construct which is equivalent to a mythology or
fiction (Kofman, 1974). Bowie reaches similar
conclusions in his fine study of Freud, Proust,
and Lacan, arguing that the demolition of the
“increasingly dilapidated partition between ‘theory’ and ‘fiction’ ” has created “a wide terrain of
near-synonymy between the two terms” (Bowie,
1987, p. 5). The blurring of the fiction–theory
partition does spare the critic the problem of

how to address the more embarrassing aspects
of Freud’s speculative forays into anthropology,
and the confusions of the Leonardo essay
become distinctly less thorny if it can be read as
personal mythology. It is, on the other hand,
difficult to reconcile such readings with Freud’s
more positivist and even scientistic statements and
ambitions. And if it can legitimately be claimed
that Proust, Freud, and Lacan are “portraitists
of the mental life” (Bowie, 1987, p. 7), it might
also be argued that reports of the demise of the
author and psychological criticism have been
greatly exaggerated.

`Putnam, Hilary (1926–) 
American philosopher. Putnam has held positions at Princeton,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and
Harvard, and has made important contributions
in various areas of metaphysics and epistemology,
including the philosophies of mind, logic, and
language. A central concern of Putnam’s earlier
work was the theory of reference. He rejected
verificationist accounts, according to which the
meaning of a sentence can be completely given
by a statement of its verification conditions (see
Logical positivism). According to the rejected
view, any shift in our theoretical Paradigm dramatic enough to change such verification criteria

would effectively change the meanings of the
relevant theoretical terms. Putnam observes that
the reference of theoretical terms can remain
constant even across fundamental changes in
our theories about objects: the developments
in chemistry which revealed that water is H2O did
not change the meaning of “water,” but rather our
beliefs about the microstructure of water (see
“The meaning of ‘meaning,’ ” in Putnam, 1975,
vol. 2). He therefore proposes that the references
of theoretical terms are partly determined by the
objects (for example, water) which play a causal
role in the phenomena described by the theory.
Since independent objects help to fix the content
of our beliefs, this causal theory of reference committed Putnam to a strong version of realism.
Since 1976, however, Putnam has been best
known for his rejection of “metaphysical realism,”
in favor of his alternative, “internal realism” (see
Putnam, 1981; 1987; and 1990). Metaphysical
realism holds that the world is made up of a fixed
totality of determinate, theory-independent
objects, and that there is a single true description
of that world, whether we can discover it or not.
A theory is true only if it corresponds to the
way theory-independent objects really are. The
standard to which metaphysical realism holds
our theorizing, then, is that of a God’s-Eye View
of the world. Putnam argues that this standard is
ultimately incoherent.
The fundamental insight which reveals this
incoherence is what Putnam calls the “phenomenon of . . . conceptual relativity” (Putnam,
1990, p. x). Theories do not simply reflect theoryindependent facts, but conceptualize those facts.
Such conceptualizations are conventional and
relativistic in the sense that we can equally well
use different schemes to understand the world.
Putnam argues both that this element of convention is ineliminable from our theories, and also
that there is no way to draw a clear line between
the conventional and factual contributions to
knowledge. Since any description of the world
is already infected with convention, we are left with
no way to characterize the world as it is “in
itself,” or to give any clear sense to the metaphysical
realist ideal of a God’s-Eye View on an independent world.
Conceptual relativity does not imply relativism,
however. From the fact that different conceptual
schemes can be used to interpret the world, it does

Putnam, Hilary

`punk
 A term used since the late 1960s to
describe, first, a form of pop music and, later, its
associated youth Subculture. As a musical
description, punk was originally deployed by
American writers to describe a form of rough,
aggressive, teenage rock and roll. The term
(which derived from criminal street slang)
described a sound (harsh, guitar-driven), an attitude (“get out of my way!”), and a form of production (cheap, do-it-yourself ). When British
musicians began to make a similar sort of music
in the mid-1970s (often directly influenced by
American bands) journalists gave them the same
label. In Britain, though, punk took on other
connotations (see Savage, 1992). Punk groups
like the Sex Pistols and the Clash were more
self-conscious about their shock effect, and more
aware of the cultural power of visual images.
And it was these – spiky, dyed hair; rips and
tears and safety pins; “forbidden” signs of sex and
power and fascism; a deliberate ugliness (see
Hebdige, 1979) – that were adopted by workingclass youths across Britain, thus inspiring both
local music-making scenes and a national punk
subculture which became a mocking commentary
on the Queen’s Silver Jubilee. The punk look
may have ended up as a tourist attraction, the
punk sound just another style export, but the punk
attitude continues to be an important, anarchical strand of popular music culture.

not follow that every scheme is as good as any
other. Putnam points out that any argument
for such wholesale relativism is self-refuting.
To insist that relativism might still be true, even
though unwarranted, is just to make an assertion
about how things “really” are, and thus to assume
the God’s-Eye perspective Putnam rejects as
incoherent.
Putnam replaces the metaphysical realist appeal
to an “external,” God’s-Eye perspective with his
“internal” realism, which insists that our notions
of truth and rationality are deeply interconnected. We understand truth not in terms of correspondence to completely theory-independent
objects, but rather in terms of a theory’s satisfaction
of the epistemological standards internal to our
theoretical practices. Conversely, our conception
of rationality is bound up with truth, since rational standards bring us into theoretical projects
which attempt to “get things right.” For Putnam,
a statement is true if it can be warranted by
knowers with more or less our cognitive powers
and standards, given that epistemic conditions were
good enough. This account must be qualified
because our cognitive standards evolve over
time, but this Historicity does not mean that
different cognitive standards are all equally good
(or bad). Such norms are subject to reform, in
the sense that the future growth of knowledge
(guided by those very norms) may lead us to

see their limitations, and to revise them so as to
lead to theories with better “fit” to our overall
experience and background beliefs.
Despite appearances, this internal realism is not
completely unrelated to Putnam’s earlier realism
(see Ebbs, 1992 for a stronger version of this
idea). His early causal theory also insisted on
an interconnection between reference to objects
and our theoretical beliefs. Thus, even in his
early period Putnam did not conceive of objects
in absolute independence from what our theories
have to say about them. From this point of view,
Putnam’s move to internal realism can be seen
as an attempt to reform and clarify his initial
realist intuitions, thereby saving what was coherent about them from the Scylla of metaphysical
realism and the Charybdis of relativism.

`Quine, Willard van Orman (1908–2000)
American philosopher. Quine spent his career
at Harvard, beginning in the 1930s. His works
include important contributions in logic,
philosophy of Language, metaphysics, and
epistemology, and are widely known for the
controversial doctrines of indeterminacy of
translation, inscrutability of reference, and
ontological relativity. These three positions are
deeply related to one another, and to Quine’s
rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction.
Quine argued against Rudolf Carnap’s project
of rational reconstruction of science, which
strove to separate genuine disagreements from
pseudo-problems by giving a rigorous characterization of the rules of evidence assumed by
investigators. According to Carnap, various
linguistic frameworks might serve for the formulation of genuine questions, but each must have
specific rules determining how such questions
could be resolved by evidence (see Ricketts,
1982). This picture of rationality essentially distinguishes between analytic and synthetic truths.
Analytic truths are established by the assumption
of the framework, and are thus revisable only in
response to the considerations of convenience
proper to framework choice. Synthetic truths
respond to empirical evidence.
Quine argues that this analytic/synthetic
distinction is unsustainable. Carnap’s simple
stipulation of analytic sentences does nothing
to elucidate the general notion of analyticity,

because it defines analyticity only for one framework. Moreover, such stipulation presupposes
the idea of linguistic frameworks which the
appeal to analyticity was supposed to clarify.
Quine also insists that purported analytic truths
are not fundamentally distinct from synthetic
claims when it comes to theory revision. Since
empirical theories are underdetermined by their
evidence, we always have various options for
revising a disconfirmed theory. In particular, we
could maintain some favorite (synthetic) theory
in the face of recalcitrant evidence by forfeiting
some of the “analytic” sentences (logic, rules of
evidence, etc.) through which the theory implies
the unwanted empirical consequence.
The notion of analyticity might also be
defended by appeal to a clear notion of meaning.
A sentence would be analytic if it were true
simply by virtue of the meanings of its words.
Quine, however, finds meaning itself indeterminate. He formulates these worries through the
thought experiment of radical translation, the
project of producing a translation manual for
a language hitherto completely isolated from our
own. A successful manual would correlate native
expressions with English expressions of the same
meaning, and the mutual isolation of the two languages guarantees that any resulting clarification
of the notion of meaning will be independent of
antecedent assumptions. Unfortunately, Quine
argues, a field linguist could adopt any number
of substantially different translation manuals,

each consistent with all native speech dispositions.
Some sentences, of course, are closely tied to
sensory stimulations. Thus, the linguist may find
that natives assent to the sentence “Gavagai” in
the presence of rabbits, and dissent from it in their
absence. She might then translate “Gavagai” by
“Lo, a rabbit.” Most sentences, however, are
standing sentences, for which patterns of assent
and dissent do not change on the basis of stimulation (for example, “There have been black
cats”). The linguist translates such sentences
through “analytical hypotheses” about the
appropriate translations for the parts (words) of
sentences like “Gavagai” (see Quine 1960, pp. 68–
72). She supposes, for example, that “gavagai”
means “rabbit,” and uses this conjecture to
translate standing sentences containing that
word. Ultimately, she constructs her own native
sentences to test native reaction to her emerging
translation manual.
According to Quine, these analytical hypotheses
are plagued by indeterminacy. Rabbits are present
when and only when undetached collections of
rabbit parts and temporal stages of rabbits are.
These other phrases thus seem equally good as
translations of “gavagai.” If we could ask questions about, for example, whether this “gavagai”
is the same as that, then we might resolve this indeterminacy; but in radical translation, any rendering
of some native expression as “same as” is itself
in question. The same native expression might be
translated by “This is the same rabbit as that,” or
by “This undetached rabbit part belongs with
that.” Different syntactic Structures are reciprocally related, so that changes in the translations
of one kind of word can be offset by adjustments
in the translations of another, preserving all native
speech dispositions. Incompatible translation
manuals therefore produce equally good renderings of the native language. In fact, we learn our
own language through these same empirical
methods, and given that we all speak the same
language, any facts about that language must be
publicly accessible by such means. Since these
methods do not suffice to determine a translation
manual, translation is indeterminate: there is no
fact of the matter about the meanings of standing sentences.
Similar considerations support the doctrines of
inscrutability of reference and ontological relativity.
Not only is the meaning of sentences including

the word “gavagai” indeterminate, but also the
reference of the term itself eludes specification.
If there were a fixed interpretation for the logical
particles concerned with the individuation of
objects, then we could precisely specify which
objects our terms refer to. But there is no such
privileged interpretation of our logical vocabulary.
Therefore, any theory can be reinterpreted so as
to change its basic ontology, given corresponding
adjustments in the theory’s “apparatus of individuation” (Quine, 1969, p. 39). Under such a
transformation, there will still be a difference
between rabbits and undetached rabbit parts. This,
however, shows only that the logical syntax of the
theory generates two different “nodes” (Quine,
1992, p. 31) to which we can assign objects.
Absent any fixed interpretation of the apparatus
of individuation, we can assign rabbits and their
undetached parts to either node indiscriminately.
Thus, no terms have an absolute reference, and
fundamental ontology itself is relative to our
choice of a translation manual.
It may now seem that Quine has not departed
from Carnap after all. Just as the commitments
of Carnap’s investigator were understood relative
to a choice of linguistic framework, so a
Quinean’s ontology is fixed relative to a choice of
translation manual. This appearance is deceptive, however. Quine insists that it makes no
sense to think of investigators standing back
from their language and theory to make a choice
among alternative frameworks or ontologies. We
are always already within our language/theory,
and our investigations make sense only as
understood from this internal point of view.
Epistemology itself must therefore become
natural science (see Quine, 1969, pp. 69–90).

race

See Comparative racialization

`race–class–gender analysis 
A method of
interpreting texts that attends to the complex
intersection of race, class, and gender oppressions
in the production of social structure and human
subjectivity. The term “Text” here is broadly construed, including literary texts, popular cultural
texts (televised narratives, for example), political
Discourses, social practices, and social structure
itself. Race–class–gender analysis has multiple
roots in three scholarly traditions: black, Marxist,
and feminist inquiry. Each of these traditions,
however, originally defined its problematic (its
framework of ideas and concomitant problems)
exclusively in terms of only one of the three components: black scholars tended to isolate Race,
Marxists isolated Class, and feminists isolated
Gender as the primary axis of socially constructed
difference and oppression, and consequently as the
primary category of inquiry and analysis. There
were important precursors to race–class–gender
analysis in the early 1970s, including prominently
the socialist-feminist critique of classical Marxist
theory as inadequate to explain women’s work,
and subsequently the development of socialistfeminist theories to account for the relationship of
gender and class (see Barrett, 1980). Also, Lillian
Robinson’s essays in feminist literary criticism,
collected in Sex, Class, and Culture (1978), urge
feminists to commit themselves to the problems

of race and class. Properly speaking, however,
race–class–gender analysis is the invention of
women of color, their creative response to the fact
that their experiences, histories, and cultural
production (including the production of theory)
have been excluded, ignored, effaced, marginalized, and trivialized everywhere in academia, as
much by scholars proclaiming themselves to be
radically subversive as by traditional conservators
of the status quo. Race–class–gender analysis
was developed by feminists of color in order to
reinterpret their own lives and theorize their own
standpoint (Collins, 1990).
In the early 1970s, black feminist theorists
worked with notions of the “double” or “triple
oppression” of black women, their subjection to
both racist oppression as black people and patriarchal oppression as women. Racism and sexism
combine, particularly through racial and sexual
divisions and stratifications of labor, resulting
in the assignment of most black women to the
impoverished classes. Discourses of race efface sex,
while discourses of sex efface race, either rendering women of color invisible or marking them as
always somehow different, anomalous and therefore marginal. While constructing “women of
color” as a distinct social entity and promoting
the visibility of women of color in all spheres of
social life, theories of double and triple oppression quickly proved inadequate, however, in
part because they were analytically reductive and
in part because of their undesirable political

consequences. For one thing, they tended to reify
destructive stereotypes, characterizing women
of color as the ultimate victims, “sturdy black
bridges” whose magnificent, astonishing achievement is that they survive at all (Chigwada, 1987).
They also did little to resolve conflicts between
black feminists and those multiple others who
logically were and should practically have been
their allies. The analytical separation of race,
class, and gender oppressions neatly coincided with
social practices of racism, sexism, and classism to
produce oppositional movements that were dominated by identity politics, tended toward separatism, and inadequately addressed black women’s
needs. In disputes concerning which type of
oppression could legitimately be considered primary
and how to rank and order types of oppression
into hierarchies – disputes which decided how
movements set political agendas and distributed
resources – black women were frequently cast
as a desirable prize and pressured to “choose
sides.” The first anthology of black feminist
writings published in the United States, Toni
Cade (Bambara)’s The Black Woman (1970),
attempted to rewrite the terms of these debates,
expressing resentment of both the racism of white
feminism and the sexism of black nationalism.
Throughout the 1970s, black feminist theory was
addressed to multiple audiences, including white
women and black men, but increasingly became
constructed as a transaction among women of
color, an intellectual and political enterprise
authored by and for themselves.
Although race–class–gender analysis had been
implicit in the work of nineteenth-century black
feminists such as Frances Harper and Anna Julia
Cooper (work that was “lost” to several generations of twentieth-century cultural critics), the first
explicit articulation of contemporary race–class–
gender theory was the Combahee River Collective’s
manifesto, “A Black Feminist Statement” (1977):
The most general statement of our politics at
the present time would be that we are actively
committed to struggling against racial, sexual,
heterosexual, and class oppression and see as our
particular task the development of integrated
analysis and practice based upon the fact that the
major systems of oppression are interlocking.
The synthesis of these oppressions creates the
conditions of our lives. As black women we see

Black feminism as the logical political movement to combat the manifold and simultaneous
oppressions that all women of color face.

The language of the collective’s statement is
revealing. Clearly, the emphasis is on oppression, the single most repeated word. Race, class,
and gender are not merely categories for analysis, variables to be manipulated by the analyst,
or “differences” that might either be described,
subordinated to another variable, or set aside in
order to generalize. Instead, race, class, and gender are the fundamental hierarchies which create
oppressive social relations, relations of inequality in which the subordination of one group
constitutes and is the necessary condition for the
privilege of another. Forms of oppression are
neither separable nor “additive,” but “interlocking,” “manifold and simultaneous.” As Dill and
Zinn (1990) explain, “they operate in complex and
confounding ways” as each black woman “experiences the effects of these hierarchies and her location in them as a whole. She cannot divide her
life into component parts and say which status
has the greatest impact at any given moment.”
Rather than constructing a single, monolithic
“black” or “female experience,” commitment to
race–class–gender analysis reveals the diversity
and variety of black women’s situations, locations,
and positions in historically specific social formations. Race–class–gender analysis is firmly and
finally committed to a transformative political
agenda, to intervention in and transformation
of the oppressive economic, political, and labor
relations that exist among social groups. Analyses
of Culture, especially of cultural representations, are only valuable to the extent that they
inform practice, contributing concretely to political struggles against Racism, sexism, heterosexism, and capitalism.
Race–class–gender analysis yields finely
nuanced studies of history, culture, and Ideology that are particularly useful for rendering
visible the agency of oppressed people. The
work of Hazel Carby, who is associated with
the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies
in Birmingham, exemplifies the achievements
of race–class–gender analysis by the late 1980s.
In Reconstructing Womanhood (1987), Carby
examines the disarticulation by late nineteenthcentury Afro-American women of dominant

`racial neoliberalism 
The Second World War
is widely considered to have revealed the extreme
dangers of racial conception and thinking,
what such commitments entail and some claim
invariably bring about. By the late 1940s race
was being challenged as a scientifically vacuous,
morally repugnant, and politically dangerous
notion. European societies especially sought to
expunge race from social reference. But this rejection presupposed that racial conception and the
sort of political order it entailed are predicated
exhaustively on its naturalistic interpretation that
whites or Europeans are inherently superior to
those who are not. Following first the anti-colonial
and then the civil rights struggles, increasingly
the commitment regarding race in social arrangements came to be expressed as colorblindness, or
more generally as racelessness. And underpinning
this latter commitment is a competing conception
of racial conception, one I call racial historicism:
namely, that those not white or of European heritage are historically – culturally or civilizationally – immature by comparison with those who are.
In Western Europe this shift followed almost
immediately its painful wartime experiences and
the drive to reconstruct, reconfiguring as much
Europe’s imagination of itself as the material
conditions of its well-being. In the USA, the stress
on colorblindness, though expressed as early as
1896 in Justice Harlan’s famous dissent in Plessy
v. Ferguson, took a couple of decades longer to
solidify. It materialized first as a characteristic
expression of the civil rights regime and then
as a reaction to its commitment to affirmative
action. One was not supposed to judge intellectual or moral competence, or for that matter
physical prowess, by the color of a person’s skin.
Colorblindness – or racelessness more generally
– claimed to judge people according to individualized merit and ability. Where members of a

sexual ideologies and their production of an
alternate discourse in which black womanhood was
rearticulated in liberatory terms. Carby’s project
necessarily entailed critique of both the androcentricity of constructions of nineteenth-century
black American experience and the racism inherent in contemporary white feminist constructions of interracial “sisterhood,” which Carby
finds nonviable in light of the historical failure of
white women to form progressive alliances with
black women against racism (see also Carby,
1982). She concludes with an argument for a
practice of Cultural studies attentive to contradiction and discontinuity and critically aware
of itself as a Signifying practice, itself a sign and
site for the production of ideology. Other useful
entries into this dynamic line of inquiry include
Bryan, Dadzie, and Scafe’s history of black
experience in Great Britain, The Heart of the
Race (1985), and Evelyn Glenn’s history of three
generations of Japanese-American women, Issei,
Nissei, War Bride (1986).
Race–class–gender analysis is not a method
restricted to the study of women of color, although
the primary site for its production so far has been
the black feminist movement. While race–class–
gender analysis is marginalized in both the academy as a whole and even in Women’s studies
(Dill and Zinn), it has important implications
for every aspect of cultural studies. Not only
black women but also everyone else is located
in a social structure organized by race, class, and
gender; everyone is categorized – empowered
and/or disempowered – by these intersecting
systems of privilege and inequality; and each and
every significant social practice, whether material
or discursive, has some relation, whether of
opposition or complicity or both, to them.

racially identified group were generally and repeatedly judged to fail, or to be less qualified, it would
be attributed to cultural deficiencies of the group,
historically developed, rather than as naturalistically determined. Colorblindness, far from inconsistent with racial historicism, was its contemporary
extension, the perfect cultural corollary for emergent
neoliberal political economies.
The increasing stress on individualized merit
and ability was coterminous with structural shifts
in state formation from welfarism to neoliberalism accelerating from the second half of the 1970s
onwards. Neoliberalism took hold of political
imaginaries as capitalism vigorously sought to
expand its market reach, as technologies of travel,
communication, and information flows became
speedier and more sophisticated, shrinking distances and compressing time. As globalization took
on dramatically new forms following the global
war pitting freedom’s good against fascism’s evil
and successful anti-colonial liberation struggles,
its regimes of management and rule developed
novel strategies. Eventually, these cohered under
the rubric of neoliberalism.
Neoliberal commitments, increasingly institutionalized with the respective rules of Thatcher,
Reagan, and Kohl, have structurally transformed
the state. From the 1930s through the 1970s, the
liberal democratic state offered a more or less
robust set of institutional apparatuses concerned
in principle at least to advance the welfare of its
citizens. Citizens benefited from social security,
welfare safety nets, various forms of national
health system, the expansion of and investment
in public education, including higher education,
in some states to the exclusion of private and religiously sponsored education, and the emergence
of state bureaucracies as major employers. Since
then, and as reaction, the state has been molded
into a structure increasingly troubled with securing privatized interests from the perceived contamination and threat of those deemed for various
reasons not to belong, to have little or no standing, the welfare of whom is calculated to cost too
much, economically or politically.
Neoliberalism is identified as the undertaking
to maximize corporate profits and efficiency by
reducing costs, most notably caused by taxes,
tariffs, and regulations, expanding the freedom of
unregulated (or, what amounts to the same thing,
self-regulating) flows of capital, goods, and services

and more recently of information. Neoliberalism,
then, is committed to letting the market regulate
itself so far as the artificial constraints of politics
will allow, placing faith in its capacity to optimize
resource allocation and expand employment
capacity as a result of sustained profitability
and subsequent economic growth. It follows that
neoliberalism is committed to denationalizing
industry and de-unionizing labor in the name of
limiting state regulation, reducing public costs and
so rolling back the need for public funding. And
it stresses even the need to resolve public policy
and political questions by subjecting them to the
supposedly rational calculus of monetized costs
and benefits.
In short, 9/11 hastened and heightened the
shift already well under way from the caretaker
or pastoral state of mid-twentieth-century welfare
liberalism to the traffic cop state of the millennial turn. The latter, by contrast, seeks to elevate
privatization of property, revenue generation,
utilities, services, and social support systems,
including health care, aid, and disaster response
and relief. The privatizing of services is particularly revealing, shifting the traditional caretaking
functions of the modern state – emergency relief
etc. – increasingly to profit-making or charitable
institutions. This inevitably produces bifurcated
experiences of social goods and access such as
health care, education, and even public highways. In turn, privatized property – equated with
nationalist identification and supplementing state
enforcement – has functioned to rehomogenize
the body politic. Where the welfare state, with
all its contradictions and failings, produces a
modicum of social egalitarianism, the neoliberal
state exacerbates inequality, further privileging
the already privileged.
So neoliberal states are restricted to securing
conditions for privatized interests to flourish,
and of shaping – policing may not be too strong
a term – the flows of information, capital, and
consumer goods to these ends. Neoliberalism’s
emphasis is less to get rid of the state (despite that
common, even clichéd characterization) – what,
in any case, exactly would that mean? – than
radically to shift its priorities, to redirect it to
represent different interests, to do different work.
Support for state institutions of violence, their
enactment and (re)enforcement – military, policing, homeland security – spiral at the cost of a

593
– the state. The state is to stand for protecting
me, and those like me, my national family. The
traditional language and objects of racial humiliation, expunged from social characterization
because supposedly at odds with this extreme
individualization, are not so much erased as similarly structurally transformed. They now silently
reference those who threaten the fiscal well-being
(notably the perpetually unhealthy, the precarious or disposable) or the social security of the
nation (namely, those deemed to be threatening,
to embody death approaching, and those, even
entire nations, identified as or with them).
In the USA, the Minutemen, a vigilante border
patrol group fueled by Latin American antiimmigrant sentiment with tacit approval from
the Bush administration, protested under the
slogan, “This is America, get off my property.” In
this, the Minutemen perfectly represent neoliberal state commitment. The traditional state
function of border enforcement was abrogated
under the Bush presidency to a private, selfpromoted vigilante group. The claim to America
is staked as a national one, the belonging to
which is implicitly characterological: one is taken
to belong because one embodies the characteristics – the character – of presumptive Americans,
its rugged individualism, racially coded as white.
And public land, the property of the nation, is
privatized, becomes enclosed, from which the
group can expel those taken not to belong. There is
a privatizing, too, of extreme political expression,
encouraging private sphere expression of views that
the formal representatives of the state, with its
nominal commitment to neutrality and formal
equality, cannot be seen to express, to stand for.
If the Minutemen trade on racial presumption
implicit in the representational codes they readily
express and circulate, racial meanings have animated
neoliberal attacks on the welfare state. The most
obvious example was the strident vocal attacks
on the “Welfare Queen.” She is projected as the
stereotypical single black mother of multiple children, usually portrayed as having different fathers,
minimally educated, irresponsible, refusing work
and collecting welfare while partying all night long.
Sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll, at state expense.
Where the figure of the Welfare Queen suggested
that the welfare state did nothing but support idle,
undeserving, and overly fertile black women, the
image of state support for the undeserving poor

racial neoliberalism

diminishing treasury burdened by dramatic tax
reductions for the wealthiest and consequently
crimped state revenues and squeezed social welfare commitments. Social welfare commitments,
including subsidized education or health care,
are defunded, the resources sustaining them
shifted to repressive state functionalities such as
the police, military, and prisons. Far from dismantling the state, or drowning it, neoliberalism
would make it more robust, more intrusive,
more constraining, more repressive.
The social ends of state emaciation accordingly are not that social spending should terminate. Instead, in being redirected into private
hands, social spending and charitable giving are
fashioned by and for the social and political
interests of those with capital to spare. Those
recalcitrant states or population factions not
willing to support or that resist the neoliberal
political economy of structural adjustment, debt
creation, and regulation are subjected to more
direct forces of militarized or policed imposition. In the extreme, “uncooperative,” “rogue”
forces, or unruly populations (states, communities, groups), are to be subjected to constraining
– and at the extreme necropolitical – discipline
through the threat of imprisonment or death,
physical or social.
These forces of precarity, disposability, and
unruliness are likewise defined through racial
extension and rearticulation. Where the prevailing
social commitments for the liberal democratic state
had to do with social well-being revealed in the
registers of education, work, health care, and
housing, the neoliberal state is concerned above
all with issues of crime and corruption, controlling immigration, and tax-cut stimulated
consumption. Contemporary neoliberalism thus
is committed to a sociality of security that
encourages citizens to lock themselves in (to
gated communities) while it locks up (in prisons)
or out (by way of immigration restrictions) the
undesirable. Where the liberal democratic state was
concerned in the final analysis with the welfare
of its citizens, the neoliberal state is concerned
above all with their security.
These transformations in the structure of the
social are rationalized to secure individuals, their
families, and those they choose to care for. At
the macro level neoliberalism expresses itself in
terms of the nation over – even at the expense of

racial neoliberalism

594
of color was branded into the social imaginary by
the determined attack on affirmative action from
the mid-1970s onwards. Affirmative action was
considered unacceptable to the neoliberalizing
stress on individual merit because it was taken to
reward undeserving people on the basis of group
attributes or achievements, not on individual effort
and excellence. Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination to
the Supreme Court represented for her principal
critics not just an affirmative action appointment but a preferential treatment presidency.
Indeed, for neoliberals committed to privatizing
individualization, a narrowed projection of affirmative action – rewarding people for no reason
other than their membership of a racial group –
came to be their standard-bearer of contemporary racism. Liberalism’s very instrument for
undoing the effects of racism became neoliberalism’s poster child for the condition of racism itself.
These attacks on affirmative action reveal a
deeper critical concern for neoliberals troubled
over race. In the USA, neoconservative critics
of the state implicitly identify it as representing
blackness and the interests thought most directly
to advance black life. As a result both of serious
application of anti-discrimination legislation and
of affirmative action policies, the state became the
single largest employer of African Americans.
The perception among critics of these programs
accordingly devolved into the view that black
people are either employed because they are the
beneficiaries of affirmative action, or supported
by welfare. In short, from the 1970s on, the state
increasingly came to be conceived as a set of institutions supporting the undeserving. Fear of a black
state is linked to worries about a black planet, of
alien invasion and alienation, of a loss of the sort
of local and global control and privilege long
associated with whiteness. Barack Obama cannot
possibly represent the United States because he
cannot possibly be an upstanding member of the
nation (“look, he wasn’t even born here”).
Neoliberalism accordingly can be read as a
response to this concern about the impending
impotence of whiteness. Neoliberalism is committed to privatizing property, utilities, and social
programs, to reducing state expenditures, increasing efficiencies, and to individual freedom from
state regulation. As the state was seen increasingly to support black employment, to increase
expenditures on black education, and to increase

regulation to force compliance, white neoconservatives found neoliberal commitments increasingly relevant to their interests. It was but a
short step from privatizing property to privatizing race, removing conception and categorization
in racial terms from the public to the private realm.
It does not follow that the state purges racism from
its domain. Instead, the state is restructured to
support the privatizing of race and the protection
of racially driven exclusions in the private sphere
where they are set off-limits to state intervention.
California’s happily defused experiment with the
Racial Privacy Initiative best represents the sort
of structure proponents of neoliberal commitment
seek accordingly to put in place.
The Racial Privacy Initiative was a ballot proposition placed before the California electorate in
the November election of 2003. It was intended
to restrict state government from collecting
any racially identified data save principally for
criminal justice investigations (police profiling) or
certain sorts of medical research. It was designed
to make it impossible to track ongoing racial discrimination across a wide range of social indices,
including residential, educational, and employment. While the proposition failed significantly
to garner electoral support, its terms of conception should be noted. The Racial Privacy Initiative
was not a proposal to outlaw racial discrimination, to address past or to redress structural
racism. It was, to put it bluntly, the “protection
of private racial discrimination initiative,” the
undertaking not just to privatize racism but to
protect ongoing discrimination in private, to
restrict it from scrutiny and from intervention.
An example from a different social context will
suffice to illustrate the implications of a policy such
as this. In Paris, having run out of beef one day,
a privately run soup kitchen discovered by accident that if it made soup with pork neither
Muslims nor Jews would eat it. This “identity
soup,” as it came to be called, served as the rallying cry for those explicitly considering Europe
to be white and Christian, for those calling
jingoistically for “Ours before the Others.” The
outcry for or against this expression of continental
nativism notwithstanding, this sort of private
expression would be beyond the reach of state
restriction in the USA (though a number of
municipalities in France subsequently banned it).
The neoliberalizing of race accordingly entails

595
to spend half or less on education per student than
top-tier private universities. Students of color
are overwhelmingly educated at public institutions,
when they make it into higher education at all;
private universities are overridingly the preserve
of wealthier whites. The most extreme version
of this, once again, is represented by the recent
budget slashing in the state of California by a
Republican minority legislature and Governor
holding hostage a racially mixed populace to
balance a deeply deficited budget. In the 2009/10
budget, state support for all levels of education
was cut by 25 percent, while deep tax breaks for
large corporations remained firmly fixed in place.
Programs supporting the racially mixed poor
and middle class have been devastated, leaving
the overwhelmingly white wealthy almost completely untouched. One Republican state legislator recently declared that California could no
longer afford to support its poor, who should seek
to move to states better equipped to provide
employment or welfare.
As with personal or corporate bankruptcy,
this emaciation of the social support sector of government revenues forces a radical restructuring of
public programming and state governmentality.
The immediate implication of such state restriction and ultimately devastation is to redistribute
wealth upwards. The point, explicitly articulated
by neoconservative pundits and neoliberal proponents, including politicians, is to put more
wealth into the hands of the already wealthy.
Expenditures of the wealthy (largely on themselves), the public is repeatedly misinformed,
will trickle down into jobs for the less well off.
(Foreign policy supposedly runs on the fuel of the
same logic.) But the mission, as much as any, is
also to elevate the decision-making, social engineering, and effective powers of the well off. The
social effect of state emaciation, accordingly, is
not that social spending should end completely.
Instead, in being redirected into private hands, it
is fashioned by and for the social and political
interests of those with capital to spare.
Now the elevated factions of social class in
traditional racial states have traditionally been
white, or more precisely representing the interests of those occupying the structural class position of whiteness (and men). The US Census
Bureau reports that in 2000 the top 5 percent of
white wage earners received wages almost double

racial neoliberalism

the delimitation of public interventions to curtail
racisms and the discriminations on which they
invariably rest.
The social traumas of post-Katrina New Orleans
offer ample illustration of these shifts from the pastoral care of welfarism to the curtailed neoliberal
state in the case of the USA, leading the way in
both definition and implementation of neoliberal
commitment.
Since Ronald Reagan’s presidency, hyperconservatives in the USA have targeted programs
for the poor both because these programs offer
easy fiscal and political targets and convenient
ideological rationalization. At the same time,
defense budgets, whether narrowly or broadly interpreted, have spiraled. Thus, the defense budget for financial year 2006 increased by 5 percent
from the previous year and almost 25 percent from
its 2002 total. The $40 billion worth of cuts in the
2006 US budget projections focused overwhelmingly on social programs such as student loans,
health care and welfare for the poor, etc. If one
factored into the figure for the defense budget
the entire range of institutional apparatuses sustaining military presence at home and around
the world, including $35 billion for Homeland
Security, funds to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and the considerable sums for their respective
reconstructions, the total would reach a staggering
$900 billion, up roughly 30 percent from 2002.
Since 2003, when it was incorporated into the
Department of Homeland Security, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been reduced by 10 percent (if President Bush had
had his way the cuts would have come closer to
25 percent). The cuts have had a debilitating
effect on disaster preparedness and reconstruction,
undercutting the agency’s ability to sustain support for those most in need, as witnessed in the
wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and ceding
to uncoordinated private charities the responsibilities of evacuation, clean-up, reconstruction,
and care. The results were more disastrous than
the natural event of the hurricane itself.
Education has not been spared either. Between
2002 and 2004, for instance, states cut their
budgets supporting public higher education by a
total of 10 percent adjusted for inflation. While
first-rate public universities today receive only
between 5 and 25 percent of their operating
budgets from their states, they typically are able

Radical Philosophy

596
those of the top 5 percent of black wage earners.
Unsurprisingly, the largest contributors by far to
political campaigns are white men. Under this
mandate of radical privatization, funded institutions, programs, and activities accordingly become
dramatically less diverse in their programming,
scope, and commitments, and notably in their
employment patterns. And given that the language
of race itself – not just as an organizing principle
of the state but as an analytic category for social
critique – is being eroded and erased, it becomes
increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to sustain
a critical focus on the pernicious effects of this
restructuring.
I am suggesting accordingly that race is a key
structuring technology both of modern state formation and more contemporarily of neoliberalism
as the driving condition of late modern capitalist
state formation. Categories of race disappear as
much from keeping account of discrimination as
from supposedly producing the discrimination
itself, thus leaving the condition it is supposed to
articulate, to mark and express, as well as identify
and assess, as untouchable as now untouched.
Devoid of race in the public sphere, racism – as
modes of racially driven exclusion, debilitation,
and humiliation – is freed up to circulate as
robustly as individuals or non-government (or
non-government funded) institutions should
choose in private.
Finally, racial social structure is founded on the
undertaking to manage heterogeneous populations,
those structurally positioned historically as nonwhite. Under neoliberal social order, heterogeneous
populations are managed through two principal
modes, whether at “home” or abroad. First, neoliberal habitus encourages social mixing by the
different but subject to the strict constraints upon
modes of conduct and civility set by the dominant codes of whiteness. The different are socially
welcome if they adopt the civilities of the dominant beliefs and values, behavior and virtues
represented by whiteness. They are welcome, in
short, if they give up their supposed difference,
their distinction. The sorts of “cordial” racism
that have proliferated since Barack Obama was
elected President exemplify the privatization of the
social standards and of the modes of racial
maintenance at work here.
The second, if related mode of racial maintenance in play under neoliberalism, then, is

triggered where mixture either does or is feared
to break down, where the different explicitly or
implicitly are thought to refuse the dominant
social, moral, and behavioral codes. Here violence
is threatened or unleashed, forcing the reinstatement of dominant order where the soft power
and rewards of intercourse fail to be enticement
enough. Behind the civilizing mission the gun or
the whip, the military or the police always lurked
as assurance, if not insurance, that the values
of whiteness would prevail. As the contemporary
extension of racial historicism, embedding cultures
of whiteness silently into its self-conception,
neoliberal sociality simply renews and updates
these modes of racial management. The vehemence
of the attacks on Obama, the circulation of explicitly racist jokes and put-downs, the aggressive
rejection even of his birthright and so citizenship
are symptomatic of deeper antagonisms to all
those supposedly not belonging to the national
family, not white “like us,” exhibiting behavior
considered antithetical to the civilized world
order. Racial neoliberalism just makes the terms
of such assertions and their denials harder to
pinpoint and more slippery to the touch.

more than anyone else who gave the movement

abstractions and Art “must invest it again with
body.” His aim was an “ontological” criticism
which would explore the relationship between
poetic language and “the dense, particular, individual world of objects.” This resulted in his
most influential critical concept, the distinction
between a Text’s “structure,” its extractable
rational argument, and its “texture,” its presentation of the heterogeneous density of the
natural world. The fullest embodiment of texture
was metaphor, which, like all the New Critics,
Ransom found represented in its highest form in
metaphysical Poetry.

 Swiss literary critic. Raymond, whose From Baudelaire to

school, defined modern literature as the flowering of an anti-rationalist, anti-classical tradition
that emphasized a quasi-mystical search for
reality, the manipulation of poetic form to
express new modes of vision, and an authorial
consciousness fusing subjective and objective
experience. The critic’s task is to recognize and

`reader-response criticism 
Originating in the
late 1960s (see Stanley Fish), reader-response
criticism constitutes an attempt to overcome some
of the limitations of the New Critical, formalist,
and structuralist approaches to the study of
literature by diverting the critic’s attention from
Text to reader. This shift coincided with, but
happened independently of, a transition from the
structuralist focus on studying the Sign Systems
underlying a literary text to a poststructuralist view
of the text as a site for a seemingly endless proliferation and subversion of meanings.
Like Poststructuralism, reader-response
criticism distrusts the notion of a reified, autonomous, and pregiven text that New criticism,
Formalism, and Structuralism propagated.
As opposed to poststructuralism, however,

reader-response criticism

philosophy. The founders objected to an emphasis
in mainstream British philosophy on linguistic
analysis. This style of philosophy, often called
Ordinary language philosophy, focused narrowly on the meaning of words and the truth or
falsity of statements. The founders viewed such
an approach as stultifying, of limited interest to
anyone outside a tight philosophical circle, and
as disengaged from the world. In contrast, their
own theoretical work, influenced by Karl Marx
and G.W.F. Hegel rather than by Bertrand
Russell and George Moore, was an extension of
the radical student movements of the late 1960s.
Today, the journal retains its radical edge, adopting socialist and feminist frameworks to address
an array of topics, from reproductive rights and
nanotechnologies to the so-called war on terror.
By design, Radical Philosophy is more magazinelike than most scholarly publications, with lively,
glossy covers, a mix of scholarly articles, letters,
political discussions, conference reports, and
interviews, and a deep circulation. Decisions are
made by an editorial collective.

reader-response criticism

598
reader-response criticism continues to think within
the framework of a more traditional version of
Hermeneutics: reader-response criticism assumes
that all perception necessarily entails interpretation, and that therefore our relationship to a literary text is inevitably a hermeneutic construct
(with its own blind spots).
In and by itself, reader-response criticism constitutes not a homogeneous but a highly diverse
and controversial movement. Much of audienceoriented criticism would agree that what reading
a literary text does is more important than what
it means, although it will not agree on much else.
The individual strands of audience-related criticism derive from disparate philosophical traditions,
and they study different aspects of the reader–
text relation.
The conventional approach to mapping the
vast ground of audience-oriented criticism consists of asking the question: what reader? Readerresponse criticism comprises a multitude of readers
such as the mock reader, a role that the reader
is invited to play for the duration of the reading (Walker Gibson); the narratee, the imagined
person to whom the narrator addresses his
Discourse (Gerald Prince); the contemporary
reader, that conglomerate of received ideas which
forms the horizon of expectations against which
a text is read – by accounting for how horizons
of expectations and consequently readings change
over time, the question of reading is brought
into historical perspective (Hans Robert Jauss); the
ideal reader, the perfectly insightful reader who
commands an intricate system of internalized
codes, conventions, and procedures – in other
words, Literary competence – and is therefore
able to understand the writer’s every move
(Jonathan Culler); the superreaders, a group of
informants who, on the basis of crucial deviations
of style and “ungrammaticalities” that form
stumbling blocks in the reading, highlight the
literariness of language (Michael Riffaterre); the
informed reader who, by adopting certain shared
assumptions about a literary text, becomes part
of an Interpretive community (Stanley Fish);
and, finally, the Implied Reader, a network of
response-inviting structures in the text (Wolfgang Iser).
All these types of readers are mere philosophical propositions, theoretical generalizations, and
should by no means be equated or confused with

actual readers reading. They are heuristic constructs intended to generate a set of notions for
understanding certain isolated aspects of the
text–reader relation.
Moreover, most of these reader constructs are
essentially deterministic entities: either the reader
is dominated by the text, and an ideal reader is
posited, or unrestricted power over the text is
accorded to him or her, “and the text is reduced
to an indeterminate Rorschach blot” (Kuenzli,
1980, p. 48). One possible way out of this predicament is opened up by Wolfgang Iser’s theory
of aesthetic response which centers on the interactions between text and reader: Iser holds that
meaning resides nowhere but in the convergence
of text and reader.
Most of the various reader-response theories
have meanwhile been converted into methods
for practical Literary criticism. For this very
reason, reader-response criticism posits a challenging alternative to the arid self-referentiality
inherent in much of poststructuralist criticism.
Moreover, reader-response criticism has supplied us with a new and original teaching angle
(even if its pedagogical benefits, which were first
explored by Louise M. Rosenblatt, have been
curiously neglected by the profession at large). And
yet reader-response criticism is still riddled with
certain unsolved methodological dilemmas.
One of its major shortcomings consists of the
fact that reader-response criticism, by evading
the question of the individual reading Subject,
does not allow for a gendered reader: reading is
seen as a hermeneutic act, and as such as transhistorical and gender-neutral. What is at stake
here is the problem of how to account for the
effects the structures in a literary text have on the
activities in which an actual reader engages when
processing a text. Attention will have to be called
to the open-endedness of all our hermeneutic endeavors as well as the intricacies and contingencies
of subject formation. What we need is a theory
which comprises both these aspects of reading, and
subsequently, a method that will enable us to
analyze how the precarious mode of existence of
a literary work on the one hand, and on the
other, the vicissitudes of subject formation act
upon one another during the individual reading.
Another problem inherent in the reader-oriented
project consists of the fact that negotiating a literary text is conceived of as a cognitive, conscious,

`record industry 
The record industry is routinely ignored in media studies, but it has more
claim than the cinema, press, or television to
have changed the experience of everyday life. We
now take it for granted that sounds are stored on
tape or disc, that they are readily available, that
they no longer need to be performed anew on each
listening occasion. On the one hand, this means
that music is no longer something special. We
not only assume now that we can hear recorded
sounds from any time and any place (a 1930s
recording of Billie Holiday; sacred music from
contemporary Thailand; the Sex Pistols’ “classic”
“Anarchy in the UK” but also that we can listen
to these sounds at any time and in any place (the
bathroom, the beach, working, shopping, driving).
Music, in short, is no longer an event. On the other
hand, this means that music, our music, is individually a commodity, and we are often therefore
possessed by it: musical taste seems to express
something emotionally real about ourselves that
the enjoyment of other media does not.
Before Bell and Edison’s experiments with the
telephone and the phonograph at the end of the
nineteenth century, to hear a disembodied voice
was to hear voice of God (or of some other
supernatural being), and it is easy to forget how
the phonograph, as a street and fairground gimmick, helped accustom people to the magic of
electricity, moving pictures, radio, and television. The record industry was at the forefront of
many of the issues that have defined the making
of twentieth-century mass culture: the transformation of domestic space into something both
public and private; the complex collusion of
manufacturers of hardware (the electrical and
electronic goods industries) and the suppliers of
software (the owners of musical rights and talents);
the competitive dependency of the various media

record industry

and fundamentally rational activity. Reading,
however, contains yet another aspect. Side by
side with the cognitive and basically rational
level of reading there exists an unconscious,
emotional, and maybe even irrational level of
assimilation. Like the cognitive level, this second
level originates with and is to some extent delimited by literary language, by the text. In other
words, any literary text comprises rhetorical
devices, layers, linguistic strategies, and points of
view. These structures guide the hermeneutic
and conscious acts of making sense of literature,
as well as the unconscious acts of Transference
and countertransference that take place
between text and reader.
What we need is a comprehensive theory of
reading, one that will remain faithful to the
actual experience of reading and that can still be
converted into a method for analyzing readers and
texts. Such a theory will have to allow for the openendedness of subject formation, and it will have
to take account of both levels of reading, the
cognitive as well as the unconscious.

on each other (in the 1920s and 1930s, for example, the radio and record industries both competed
with each other for people’s leisure time and
became entirely dependent on each other); and
the shifting strategies of “cultural imperialism” (the
pioneers of recording took their machinery across
the world like missionaries, but sold their equipment by using local sounds; the revolutionary
technology in spreading the same sounds around
the globe – and the trade is not just from West
to East or from North to South – was the portable
cassette player, which, among other things, made
piracy the central issue of the international record
business). (For an account of the record industry as an industry, see Frith, 1981, part 2.)
The record industry has changed not just the
way we listen to music also how we hear it – it
has changed our understanding of what music
can and should be. What differentiates recording
from memory or musical score as a musical storage system is its ability to reproduce, every time,
the details of a musical performance. Recording,
in short, made possible the remarkable twentiethcentury impact of Afro-American musics, and
changing recording techniques further shifted
musical expectations: electrical recording made
possible new forms of musical “perfection.” In the
end, indeed, tape (and digital) recording freed our
experience of “music” from any original happening at all (most “recorded” music today is actually assembled from sounds performed, often in
a computer, at quite different times and in quite
different places). We are left with a contradiction,
an industry that sells us something – a “record”
of a performance – that we all know did not exist.
And this is as true of “classical” music (which has
always been central to the record industry’s production and sales policies) as it is of “pop.”

`Reich, Wilhelm (1899–1957) 
An AustroAmerican psychoanalyst and apostle of sexual
freedom, Reich had the unique distinction of

having been expelled from both the International
Psychoanalytic Association and the German
Communist Party.
Reich became a member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1920 when he was still a medical student and rapidly established a reputation
as an expert on technique. Reich was also one
of the first generation of Freudian revisionists,
replacing Freud’s definition of sexuality with
a much narrower and more biological notion
of “the genital” and arguing that all neuroses
were accompanied by a disturbance of genitality
and an absence of orgastic potency. In Reich’s
view, psychic health was dependent upon orgastic potency, or the capacity to experience sexual
excitation in a natural act.
A rather less controversial innovation was the
notion of character armor and character analysis
(Reich, 1933). Originally a metaphor for the
resistance of the ego, “character” was extended by
Reich to refer to systematic defensive attitudes
which appear to resist conventional analysis and
interpretation, and which persist depite the content verbalized during treatment. In a character
neurosis, defensive conflicts appear not in the form
of identifiable symptoms, but as character traits
or modes of behavior. Character armor develops
in response to anti-sexual pressures arising within
the authoritarian family, which is held together
by the repressive power of the father.
Throughout the early 1930s Reich was active
in sexual politics in Vienna and then Berlin,
helping to establish sex-hygiene clinics offering
contraceptive advice and seeking to promote
orgastic potency. In an attempt to reconcile Freud
and Marx, Reich now argued (1935) that, just as
Marxism expressed a growing consciousness of
economic exploitation, psychoanalysis represented
an emerging consciousness of the social repression of sex. The history of psychoanalysis was the
history of the removal of sexual repression.
In 1939, Reich emigrated to the United States,
where he spent the remainder of his career. His
earlier political views gave way to what can only
be described as mysticism. The last decades of
his life were spent in an attempt to describe
and even capture the mysterious cosmic energy
he called orgone. Reich was finally imprisoned
for renting a fraudulent therapeutic device,
namely an Orgone Energy Accumulator, and
died in prison.

`reification
 From the Latin res (thing) and
facere (to make), the term literally means to
make a thing. In Marxist terminology, reification
is a specific form of Alienation in which the consciousness of the individual is so overwhelmed by
his or her identification with the means and
fruits of production and the artificial designation
of value that the dialectical process of identity
is arrested, a psychological closure taking place that
denies individual growth, as well as any meaningful
social interaction. Hence human beings lose
their humanity and become fixed properties in
the assumption of capital, wholly defined by
their purpose and utility in the capitalist drama.
An analysis of reification is implicit in Marx’s
discussion of commodity fetishism (capital), or the
social dynamics constituted by the production of
a commodity in a capitalist economy. According
to Marx, capital exploits the worker in that he
becomes a mere instrument in the production of
value, a tool of the capitalist. The ultimate
tragedy and the deciding factor in this game of
subjection, however, is the worker’s acceptance
of his thinglike identity: The social character of
men’s labor appears to them as an objective
characteristic, a social natural quality of the
labor product itself. . . . To the producers the
social relations connecting the labors of one
individual with that of the rest appear not as
direct social relations between individuals at

work, but as what they really are, thinglike
relations between persons and social relations
between things (Marx, 1977, p. 72).
The worker identifies himself with the product
to the extent that the thing that is being produced
and consumed constitutes his identity and the
nature of his interactions with others. Besides
the fact that the baker is not an individual with
distinct hopes, dreams, and aspirations, but
merely the man who bakes the bread to sustain
the productivity and utility of the engineer, the
logic of such an abstract identification limits his
relationship with others, for the man who makes
bread can have little in common with the man who
makes sophisticated machinery.
Discussion of reification has been central to
Marxist theory, especially that of Lukács, the
Frankfurt school, and the New Left, but it is, of
course, integral to any philosophical examination
of the dichotomy between appearance and reality. The dialectical process of history, as well
as individual identity, is a process toward transcendence. To define is ultimately to confine, and
to deny growth and change. A favorite topic of
notable twentieth-century theorists (de Saussure,
Barthes, Derrida, De Man, etc.), one can, none
the less, trace discussion of the implications of
naming or defining and the insidious and psychologically manipulative properties of language back
to Plato’s theory of forms (The Republic, book X).

`relative autonomy 
A category advanced by
Althusser in “Contradiction and overdetermination” (1965, pp. 87–128), in an attempt to
wrest historical materialism from the economic
determinism inherent in the orthodox Base and
superstructure topography.
Taking his cue from reflections by Engels and
Gramsci, Althusser sought to reconcile economic
“determination in the last instance” with the
“specific effectivity of the superstructures” by radically revising the traditional model. Any Social
formation was a global structure, encompassing
three regional structures – the economic, the
political, and the ideological – each of which
enjoyed “relative autonomy” vis-à-vis the others.
Accordingly, the political and ideological levels of
the Social formation were not to be regarded

relative autonomy

Reich’s reputation had always been controversial. Vilified by more orthodox psychoanalysts
(Chasseguet-Smirgel and Grunberger, 1976), he
enjoyed great popularity with the theorists of the
counterculture of the late 1960s (Reiche, 1968).
The emphasis on biological genitality and heterosexuality in his work, as well as his failure to
consider sexual difference, make it seem much less
attractive to a era marked by Feminism and gay
liberation.

as the secondary effects of a primordial cause or
the superstructural phenomena of an infrastructural essence. At once determined and determinant, they formed the “conditions of existence”
of the economic mode of production. This did not,
however, license pluralism. The superstructures
were not sheerly independent. Any social formation comprised a complex totality, a “structure in
dominance,” containing a dominant structure
which organized the hierarchy and interrelations
of the regional structures. And although the economic structure was not invariably dominant, it
was always ultimately determinant, since it allocated dominance (in precapitalist societies, for
example, to the ideological or political structures).
Althusser’s proposals possessed considerable
appeal for Marxists, since they permitted analysis
of politics and Culture to proceed unconstrained
by economic reductionism or Essentialism;
and a fertile literature emerged in their wake.
However, critics increasingly came to query the
coherence of the category, arguing that politics
and Ideology were either autonomous or determined; Althusser’s formula had failed to square
a circle from which the only exit was “postMarxism” (Hindess and Hirst, 1977; Laclau
and Mouffe, 1985). Others (see Geras, 1987, pp. 48–
50) have charged Althusser’s detractors with a
spurious rigor, vindicating the kindred notion of
“conditional autonomy.”

`Renaissance studies 
The Renaissance was
traditionally considered the era of rebirth, a
rallying of the human spirit after the “dark ages”
blotted out the accomplishments of the great
empires of Greece and Rome; the cradle of
Humanism, an age of discovery, and a pinnacle

of artistic, intellectual, and literary accomplishment. As the era that saw the recovery of the philosophy, drama, literature, and political treatises
of classical antiquity, and developed its aesthetic
and rhetorical forms in imitation of these models, the Renaissance was considered the repository
of the moral, political, and philosophical truths
of classical learning – and thus it was credited
with regenerating, safeguarding, and furthering
the essential tenets of Western civilization. The
epoch has been cast as an era of human selfdiscovery, and credited with the optimistic realization of human potential – ideas that perhaps
reveal more about post-Enlightenment Positivism than Renaissance humanism. Yet even
more recent schools of critical thought that view
much of this traditional picture as an idealized
construction indicate, in renaming the era, the
degree to which it is still considered to be the root
of contemporary Western Culture and identity: “the early modern period.”
To the scholars of the vast amount of literature in English generated in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, Renaissance studies is the
study of the English Renaissance (although it
is traditional to acknowledge the Continent –
especially fifteenth-century Italy – as the source
of the intellectual and philosophical currents
that develop in England). The invention of the
movable-type press, and the subsequent increase
in the availability of printed material leading to
a general increase in literacy across Europe; the
recovery of Classical texts that provided new
inspirational models, spurring an explosion of
literary activity; the rediscovered arts and sciences of poetry, philosophy, rhetoric, and logic;
the “new worlds” discovered through scientific and
geographic exploration; and the advent of a new
philosophical movement, humanism, which primarily valued education – these inventions, discoveries, events, and developments resulted in a
prolific explosion in arts and letters, considered
a pinnacle of achievement for the English language
and its poets, rhetoricians, and philosophers.
Still another result of the rise of a print culture
in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England is
that an immense amount of written and printed
matter has survived, not only the lyric poems and
the countless sonnets that circulated in aristocratic
circles, but also a vast body of popular literature:
ballads, broadsides, pamphlets, and play scripts

603
unified literary masterpieces that transcended
time, location, and nationality, capturing all that
was truest, most enduring, and universal in the
human condition.
Virtually every one of these assumptions has
been dismantled by the philosophical, literary, and
epistemological questions posed by Cultural
studies. From the first undermining of postEnlightenment certainties about the primacy of
the rational mind and its capability for knowing
objective, unchanging truths, to the first challenges
to the presumption that literary Canons are
formed from the impartial recognition of a universal standard of value – to the exploration
of alternative voices, histories, values – cultural
studies and recent Critical theories have
proved uniquely suited to undermining the
universalist-formalist claims that had been the
basis of traditional Renaissance studies. Inspired
to some extent by the political activism of the late
1960s and early 1970s, informed by Marxist-style
examinations of the material realities of history,
and encouraged by the feminist, civil rights,
and anti-war movements to a new awareness
of the oppressions, injustices, and exclusions of
Western civilization, a generation of scholars
ventured to challenge the (presumably) ahistorical, politically neutral aesthetic models of established critical practice. The literary Marxism of
Frederic Jameson and Walter Benjamin supplied ideological and philosophical support, as did
Louis Althusser’s meditations on Ideology
and consciousness. Michel Foucault’s theories
about how power circulates in society encouraged
literary scholars and historians to a new perception of the ways in which art functions in
the social realm that produces it: representing
specific historic situations and conflicts, now
subverting, now affirming the dominant ideological Codes of its moment. Scholars grew
more conscious of the distinction between literature and dramatic art, considering more carefully the difference between static literary texts and
the circumstances and conditions of theatrical
performance – and appreciating more accurately
early modern English drama’s unique status as
an ephemeral popular form, dependent for its
livelihood on a wildly heterogeneous cross-section
of London’s social composition at a time of
unprecedented religious, social, familial, and
economic disruption.

Renaissance studies

– those written artifacts of a flourishing new
artistic and commercial enterprise, the English
theater. Much documentation has also survived:
baptism, marriage, and burial records; legislative
accounts of lawsuits, land sales, and commercial
transactions; letters, diaries, and household accounts. That it is possible for “the Renaissance”
to appear familiar, knowable, might be a tautology of the historic moment; the kinds and quantities of historical evidence which were generated
and which survive make it possible to know
much about the period. Yet the relationship of that
material evidence to literary study – and how
literature responds to the influence of historical
forces – are vexed questions. Indeed, for much
of the twentieth century, scholars denied the
“influence” of history upon literature, viewing
literary Texts in splendid isolation from the
circumstances in which they were created. In the
literature of the Renaissance – the lyric poetry,
the sonnets of Sidney and Spenser, the plays of
Shakespeare – generations of New critics
found fertile ground to practice their methodologies, viewing the works as self-contained
verbal icons best “understood” by close reading
and attention to patterns of theme, Symbol, and
imagery.
Attention to the works of William Shakespeare
has tended to dominate Renaissance studies,
and changes in the study of Shakespeare point to
the major developments in the discipline as a
whole. Until quite recently, a handful of names
sufficed to define the field: the “Silver Poets” of
the early sixteenth century – Thomas Wyatt,
Henry Howard, John Davies, and later, Edmund
Spenser and Philip Sidney; the “metaphysical
poets” John Donne and George Herbert, and
playwright Thomas Middleton, once T.S. Eliot
had recovered them from obscurity in the 1920s
and 1930s; Shakespeare’s “great” contemporaries,
Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson; and
especially Shakespeare, the master poet whose
works embodied both formalist perfection and
humanist significance. By aesthetic criteria that
frequently elided the difference between poetry
and theatrical art, that were often antipathetic
to the physical and material conditions of the
Renaissance theater, and that deemphasized the
unstable processes by which theatrical texts
were recorded and disseminated in the period, the
plays of Shakespeare came to be regarded as

Renaissance studies

604
If anything united this coalition of (mostly
North American and British) academics in
the early 1980s (when the transition from “the
Renaissance” to “early modern studies” began),
it was a shared fascination with reading the
Renaissance against its historical moment, keen
interest in evaluating the production, circulation, and dissemination of literary art in its
material culture, and a desire to place into focus
what that culture had consigned to its margins.
A new breed of social historians (Christopher Hill,
Lawrence Stone, Keith Wrightson) gleaned data
about daily activities that made it possible to
foreground previously unrecorded lives and disregarded issues: Class, Gender, Race, Literacy.
Practitioners of new and challenging Discourses
like Feminist criticism, New historicism,
Psychoanalysis and Poststructuralism
transgressed traditional disciplinary boundaries to
borrow tools, methodologies, and resources from
the social sciences, anthropology, ethnography,
linguistics. The influence of Deconstruction
prompted questions about the referential reliability
of cherished texts, even of language itself. And
as they shattered traditional aesthetic criteria
and critical certitude, scholars acknowledged
their own “embeddedness” in the present cultural
moment and their own concerns, recognizing
the difficulty (if not the impossibility) of accurately
comprehending the ideological forces of the
past, and abandoning the traditional stance of
critical objectivity to signal their own political
investments and positions.
From its earliest inceptions, these new ways
of reading and writing about the Renaissance
registered conflicts where there had previously
been Hegemony, seeing ruptures where unities
had previously been established. No longer
repositories of essential human values, treatises on
“man” and the “human condition,” the plays of
Shakespeare and Jonson, the poetry of John
Donne and Thomas Wyatt, all could be read as
“extraordinarily sensitive register[s] of the complex struggles and harmonies of culture” – or so
claimed Stephen Greenblatt, whose Renaissance
Self-Fashioning (1980) helped to craft one of
the most significant new methodologies of the
decade. New Historicism purposed a more complete vision of “history,” one that accounted for
contradictions, exclusions, exceptions, and silences,
as previous readings, inspired by a monolithic

history of ideas, could not. Less a doctrine than
a “set of themes, preoccupations, and attitudes,”
New Historicism (or its now-preferred appellation, Cultural materialism), examines literary
and dramatic art against other discursive forms
and objects of cultural production – historical
documents, pamphlets, ballads, court masques,
royal progresses, maps, visual art – seeking “bizarre
overlappings” and “surprising coincidences”
(Veeser, 1989). By the mid 1980s, titles proliferated that confidently affirmed the extent of
this critical revisioning: Radical Tragedy (Dollimore, 1984); Rewriting the Renaissance (Ferguson,
Quilligan, and Vickers, 1986); Political Shakespeare (Dollimore and Sinfield, 1985). The
polemical introductions and prefaces of these
and other works (Holderness, 1988; Howard
and O’Connor, 1987) pledged to revolutionize
readings and ways of reading; to raise new and
profound questions about the status, value, and
claim of literary texts. New understandings of
early modern printing techniques, editorial practices, and authorship placed texts themselves
under scrutiny, raising doubts about the reliability of transmission and authorial integrity of many
Renaissance works – including Shakespeare’s
(Taylor and Warren, 1983; De Grazia, 1991).
Works and authors long considered “lesser” or
obscure were opened to interrogation (Beaumont and Fletcher, Thomas Heywood, John
Webster), while a strong feminist presence further expanded the canon by bringing to attention
works of forgotten women writers (Elizabeth
Carey, Lady Mary Wroth). Feminist readings
developed from their first attempts to acknowledge and describe – often optimistically – the place
of women in Renaissance life and art (Bamber,
1982; Lenz, Greene, and Neely, 1980); to more
skeptical appraisals of the tenacity of “patriarchal
structures” in the era (Erickson, 1985; Jardine,
1983), to more theoretical discussions of the
gendering of identity and its representation
(Callaghan, 1989; Traub, 1992). Gay perspectives contributed significant reconsiderations of
the homoerotics of the Renaissance theater, the
works of Marlowe, and Shakespeare’s sonnets
(Bray, 1982; Orgel, 1989), while postcolonial
awareness urged new attention to the discourses
of racial and ethnic difference and imperialism
in works as peripheral as Jonson’s Masque of
Blackness and as canonical as The Tempest or

605
underrated, pointing to a strain of insularity
within the profession, and, at worst, a tendency
to acclaim the derivative and merely fashionable.
Despite its rhetoric of diversity, the predominant
figures of the academic left remain principally
white and male. And given the conservative nature
of many of the institutions and structures of the
academy, and the privileged status of those who
teach in it, claims of radical commitment from
university professors can risk appearing either
wistful or incongruous. Yet despite these and
other controversies, at the midpoint of its second
decade of substantial revisioning, the study of this
significant body of literature and its remarkable,
conflicted, and astonishingly well-documented
historical moment signals continued momentum
and vitality.

`reproductive technologies 
The new reproductive technologies employ a myriad of methodologies including the use of donor sperm,

reproductive technologies

Othello. And media, performance, and Film
studies opened an important new dimension,
providing a conceptual framework and vocabulary to theorize the works of Shakespeare – and
other Renaissance dramatists – in theatrical performance, on film, and as artifacts of present
Popular culture.
Some objections have been raised to these
attempts to intepret Renaissance literature and
drama through the comprehension of the political elements of the historical moment and the
material, social, economic, and technological
circumstances that produce, value, and disseminate it. Disapproving voices from the intellectual
Right – including Washington columnist George
Will and former US Secretary of Education
William Bennett – have decried New Historicism
and other innovations as vaguely Marxist plots that
threaten to “politicize” both art and theacademy.
Allan Bloom (1987) and Roger Kimball (1991) cautioned against the assault upon the traditional
canon led by a generation of “tenured radicals,”
whose perception of literature as a register of
social and historic conflicts erased distinctions
between timeless literature and unremarkable
texts. Renaissance specialist Richard Levin’s
critiques of feminist and cultural materialist
poetics, published in PMLA (1988 and 1990),
sparked a controversy that required an entire
anthology to chronicle (Kamps, 1991), and
pointed to a nostalgia among some scholars in the
field for standard literary analysis and aesthetic
appreciation. Responses to such challenges typically claim that the criteria of aesthetic excellence
that formed literary canons are “always already”
political, molded by a patriarchal, white, elitist
culture intent on preserving its status quo; that
critics whose opinions are sanctioned by the
dominant thought systems and values of a culture
only appear to be “above” ideology and partisanship (Howard, 1994); that the ideological function
of art was no more neutral in the early modern
era than in the twentieth century. Recent developments in Renaissance studies have not occurred
without failings, excesses, and lapses of vision, such
as the sectarian quarrels that divide some critics
into factions (for example, a deepening rift
between historicists and feminists, or the disdain
of some critics for analysis of drama in performance). Scholars who favor more traditional
practices complain of being marginalized and

donor eggs, fertilization outside of the human body
(in vitro fertilization), analysis and manipulation
of genetic components, zygote transfers, and
ultimately introduction of the embryo back into
the womb. It is surprising that this trade and commerce of the conceptus has evoked only a mild
tremor in the social arena. Granted, its significance has been overshadowed by more immediate
concerns, such as current environmental and
political upheavals, however, twentieth-century
science has initiated a rupture in the biology of
human nature which challenges the very notion
of lineage. Entrance into this putative age of the
“motherless child” underscores separateness as
an organic reality. Perhaps this is an era where
the mirror will reflect a being whose attachments
are contractual and whose progenitors may be
found as entries in gamete banks, anononymous
donors of a genetic code.
Proponents of biotechnology range from feminist legal authorities, claiming the territory for
women’s autonomy rights, to physicians attempting to give infertility a disease status. Opponents
of the practice include those who perceive further
manipulation of a uniquely female experience
and the inevitable commodification of human
life. For a world which groans under the weight
of population growth and for an animal which
must endure the pathos of its “body sense,” the
current trends in reproductive strategies are
unsettling.
A central tenet in this discussion is that the new
reproductive technologies focus on the “use” of
the body and its most fundamental activity: the
joining of two sets of genetic information, rearranged through chance, which code for another
unique individual. Embedded in this rather
scant description of reproduction is a set of
emergent qualities that coalesce and structure
the human capacity for realizing self. This realization is not easily accessible through the methods of medical science, philosophy, theology, or
law, but persists as a dynamic amalgam of often
irreducible components. Consideration of the
issue thus relies on a diverse set of interpretative measures. The ultimate action required is
enmeshed in an attempt to apprehend the
potential consequences of these technologies for
values associated with the creation of well-being.
A brief examination of the cases using the
new reproductive technologies, especially contract

motherhood, uncovers a radical shift in human
relations. The issue is circumscribed by at least
three major foci: the continued social devaluation
of women and children by giving pregnancy
and birth a market value; the strengthening of
women as autonomous agents of choice; and the
reconfiguration of lived experience via foundational changes in cultural perspectives.
According to the first claim, a woman’s
relation to her reproductive life has become
increasingly derivative. Medical technology and
its reproductive interventions have promoted
an understanding of pregnancy that has quietly
begun to disrupt the narrative of birth. A medicalized language of the woman’s body and the
value written into it is being generated by a techne
that suppresses deeply personal images of the
human being. The capacity for reproduction,
once integrally bound to a particular woman,
can now be alienated from her self, objectified,
priced, and purchased according to market
demand. The ranking and use of a woman’s
body become criteria for exchange similar to
prostitution. Although this analogy appears
startling, analysis of both activities, commercialized motherhood and prostitution, reveal
that women provide their bodies for economic
gain from acts that were once reserved for an
individual’s most intimate self. Proponents of
these engagements state that women choose
to control their own reproductive and sexual
agency. With regard to surrogate motherhood, it
has been argued that the gestational or contractual mother freely enters into the arrangement.
However, this argument has been called into
question. First, it ignores the power differentials
present among people in society. The fact that most
surrogate mothers are motivated by economic
factors suggests that the fee creates a situation that
is potentially coercive. Socioeconomic survival,
not the women’s own needs and interests, is a
dominating influence. Second, in a society that
appears to place great value on child-bearing, the
emphatic pronatalist standpoint compounds the
erasure of women’s worth outside of the breeding arena and creates a diminished self-esteem in
the childless woman, thus her willingness to
conform and contract for a child.
This perspective implies that biotechnology
has splintered moral categories, and, more specifically, that the practices of embryo transfer and

607
The issue emerging from this continuum of
reproductive strategies is one of “not knowing.”
The cultural implications of “taking motherhood apart” remain hidden from society, family,
and the individual. Only recently have the gender imbalances of the postindustrial world been
articulated, and only recently has the psychological scaffold of a child’s origins been implicated
in the firmament of mental health. However, it
is not merely a woman’s cultural socialization
or a child’s early conditioning that is at stake;
it is the entire concept of “mother,” which was
formerly an inalienable truth. A woman giving
birth was the actual mother, not a variation on
this theme. Current nomenclature for “mother”
includes a list of qualifiers that define a peculiar
partitioning of the woman-with-child. The
genetic mother is the woman responsible for contributing 23 chromosomes packaged within the
ovum subsequently fertilized; the gestational
mother carries the emotional and physical risks
and supplies the tissues required to maintain the
pregnancy; the contractual or social mother provides postnatal nurturance and economic support.
Certainly the conceptual ideal of motherhood
has become fractured and this is not simply a
semantic problem.
Language here expresses underlying assumptions
and contributes to the formation of novel attitudes
and dispositions. Linguistic choices are thus
significant agents of change, and control of the
language has become a primary struggle within
the emergence of reproductive technology. Even
the phrase “reproductive technology” implies the
use of machine parts, gametes as reproductive
units or replaceable objects to be catalogued and
parceled to the consumer, a utilitarian approach
to taming the passions, an undermining of a
critical moment in human relations. In this context, the issue of reproductive technology offers
a potential explosion in the very definition of connection. It is important to examine the narrative
of this cultural infusion, the idea as it becomes
word, and the word flesh. Is the woman’s body
the experimental vessel within which we must
shape this new story? How will it be read? What
is the quality of this knowledge? Ethicists,
scientists, feminists, theologians, attorneys – what

contract pregnancy carry elements that subvert the
validity of a woman’s emotional responses to
pregnancy and birth. Adoption of these practices
requires a careful plan of inquiry focused on the
misuse of a woman’s body and the intrusions into
the constitution of a newborn child. Perhaps
becoming an object transferred at birth via a
bill of sale, an entity subject to property rights
by the contract holder, may not be in the
best interest of the individual or that of a selfreflective society.
In contrast to the commodification of life
argument, it has been claimed that the issue is not
commercialization but redefinition of women
as rational moral agents capable of assuming
responsibility for the consequences of their
actions. Carmel Shalev states that women have long
been “imprisoned by the subjectivity of their
wombs.” Their shadow life in the male-dominated
socioeconomic order suppresses a woman’s control of her bodily resources and the use of her birth
power for economic gain. Shalev suggests that considerable economic activity is already invested
in the biological and nonbiological parent–child
relationships by medical professionals, lawyers,
and social workers, and that now is the time to
imbue women with the power to negotiate the
economic value of their reproductive labor.
Central to this argument is the contention that a
woman’s faculty of reason should not be abrogated
by the emotional facets of her physiology. The
autonomy vested in a woman’s reproductive
decisions provides a buffer against the “technical
control of reproduction by detached parties for
economic and political ends.” Opinions from
other groups collude with the possibility that
traditional motherhood is not the only reproductive option. In vitro fertilization and contract
motherhood should open the way for informed
respectful deliberation on reproduction. The
assumption that human beings are free to choose
new descriptions for self, spirit, and nature
underpins these perspectives and provides an
avenue for conscious departure from a deeply
ingrained norm. This line of reasoning proceeds
to venture that diversity in the circumstances
of birth enriches the human experience. Novel
technological options will evoke new norms
and responsibilities within the context of social
relations, which may be effectuated through
contract.

forces of utterance that may retire our former
notions of self as if they were old tools that no
longer have any truth value?
It is not even a debate between nature and
Culture. Our conception of “just what something
is” emerges from an expanded sense of origin.
However, what if, via genetic manipulation of
embryos, “foreign” genes are inserted into the
embryo? The resultant genetic structures are not
a natural origin for this “human being”; rather,
they are products of a material reconstruction.
More nearly perfect entities perhaps, more evolutionarily resilient, they are thus real challenges
for natural selection; but should there be a pause
here – a deletion of the qualifier natural, since
certainly as a reproductive success this is not
“nature’s” doing?
If the new technolanguage moves outside a
system of discourse which formerly situated the
physical and metaphorical concept of mother
within the female body, what may be the significance of this movement? The being emerging
from the birth canal, conceived in this other’s
womb, carries the sign of separation, and now total
disconnection. If language serves as an opening
to the interior of a human being and body language begins in the womb (see Kristeva, 1974a,
pp. 27–8), that archaic semiotic space where
chaos coalesces into form, then it may be that the
“vocabulary” of the newborn is richly tied to the
voice and motion of the birth mother. Perhaps
these sensory cues are an imprinting not measurable by analysis but existent in that metaphysical space underpinning being. Conversely,
what is foundational here? Must the motives for
“knowing” ourselves from genetic lineage, from
pregnancy and birth be questioned? Is this just
another facet of social conditioning to be discarded
as the Deconstruction of reproduction? What
philosophy will be suitable to evaluate this
special area of knowledge, this establishment of
embryo transport and reproductive commerce? To
date, only the ethicists approach the problem
with vigor. However, their mode of investigation
is often confined to a competing individual rights
model which is subsumable under the exercise of
personal freedom, the pursuit of one’s perceived
interests. The impact of this cultural change cannot be successfully delineated using the narrative
of moral rights, cost–benefit ratios, and decision

analysis. Medical and health science attempts to
separate from the social fabric in order that tidy
technical solutions to formidable epistemic complexities may be found. Molecular biology, used
as a technology, presents the ability to divert
human biological and cultural evolution. Former
representations of the female body as women’s
reproductive singularity become reimagined and
transformed at an unprecedented rate. Whether
this practice is a further disintegration of social
relations, an erasure of intimate bodily experiences as valid determinants of the human being,
or simply another face of Eve has yet to be
determined.

`Richard, Jean-Pierre (1922–) 
French literary critic. Equally indebted to Georges Poulet
and Gaston Bachelard, Richard distinguishes
himself among Geneva school critics by his
emphasis on the material world of the mental
landscape (its organization by visual themes and
motifs) rather than on the implied metaphysical
experience of the author (Poulet’s cogito). He
consistently visualizes this interior landscape
(paysage) as a metaphor for personal experience,
“an order of things . . . a being-there” (Richard,
1979). Subjectivity in literature is expressed
objectively by a unique arrangement of Symbols
whose metamorphoses define a “concrete principle of organization . . . around which a world
is constituted and deployed” (Richard, 1961).
Richard’s work after the more purely phenomenological analyses of Literature and Feeling
(1954) and Poetry and Profundity (1955) applies
a psychoanalytic perspective to this thematic
symbolism, describing the exploratory relationship
of Subject and world as the “self-discovery of a
complex and unique libido” (Richard, 1979).
Richard’s earlier work is closer to Geneva
school practice in its emphasis on an author’s quest
for psychic unity. Like Poulet, he marshals data
drawn from the complete writings to construct
a delicately perceptive and consummately organized essay following progressive shifts and changes
in the author’s existential career. Succeeding
literary landscapes project various modes of
existence to be matched against an underlying,
dimly felt (prereflexive) sense of harmony with
the world. The essay on Paul Verlaine (Richard,
1955) describes the poet’s instinct for nuances and
fleeting, liminal experience as a “faded quality”
that is authentically Verlaine and cannot be rejected without destroying his sense of self – and his
art. Richard’s later work (for example, the books

Richard, Jean-Pierre

`Rich, Adrienne (1929–) 
US poet and feminist critic. Already a canonical poet when she came
out as a radical lesbian feminist in the 1970s,
Rich has been uniquely situated as a feminist
spokesperson: she can be neither marginalized,
patronized, nor dismissed by the establishment she
opposes. To read Rich’s cultural criticism is to have
one’s finger on the pulse of a major artery of
contemporary US Feminism: initially radical,
then giving way to a sophisticated Race–class–
gender analysis that questions its own previous construction of a universal female identity
as the basis of feminist alliance. Of Women Born
(1976) exposes contradictions between (oppressive) ideologies and (potentially liberating) experiences of motherhood. On Lies, Secrets, and Silence
(1979) explores issues central to radical feminism: women’s creativity and its thwarting, the
revolutionary potential of woman bonding, and
barriers to it such as racism and homophobia. In
Blood, Bread and Poetry (1986), Rich scrutinizes
the historical and cultural specificity of her own
identity as a political poet and asks readers to do
the same: to locate ourselves at specific intersections of race, class, gender, and national
identities, for it is there that we experience the
contradictions that blind us or frighten us into
collaboration with systems of oppression. In
What is Found There (1993), Rich continues the
work begun in Blood, but with a strengthened
commitment to international and postcolonial
issues. As a literary critic, Rich “re-visions” the past,
revaluing the work of women, poor, immigrant,
and postcolonial artists as well as canonical
figures, and tests the limits of reading and writing as tools of liberation. In Rich’s work on
women writers, Patrocinio Schweickart discerns
a model of feminist reading. Rich’s essay, “Compulsory heterosexuality and lesbian existence,”
merits special attention as a cornerstone of lesbian studies: here Rich rejects the assumption that
heterosexuality is “natural,” arguing instead that
it is a socially constructed institution oppressive
to all.

on Mallarmé and Proust) replaces such evaluations with a discreet psychoanalytic framework.
Microreadings (1979–84) marks a shift from
broader initial themes to a starting point in
“myopic” but revelatory details; The State of
Things (1990) treats the writing of eight lesserknown contemporary writers as “territories” to be
described in material or sensuous terms.
Throughout his work, Richard counts on the
“sensuous logic” possessed by every human
being – by each “reading body” or corps lisant
(1979) – to provide the link between words and
world, and the recognition of another’s material
imagination.

`Richards, Ivor Armstrong (1893–1979)
English critic. Richards was the founding father
of modern English Literary criticism. As a
young lecturer in the newly created English faculty at Cambridge in the 1920s, he invented and
provided a theory of Practical Criticism, a
method of close linguistic analysis which, further
elaborated by his pupils William Empson and F.R.
Leavis and then by the American New Critics,
became the dominant mode of academic criticism
throughout the English-speaking world.
However, to see Richards primarily as the
inventor of a technique, or as a kind of formalist, is to misunderstand both his project and the
reasons for its extraordinarily wide and enduring

influence. Richards was fundamentally a culture
theorist, a propagandist, and his literary criticism was almost a by-product. The key to his ideas
lies in a nonliterary work, The Meaning of
Meaning (with C.K. Ogden, 1923), which is at root
a melodramatically pessimistic vision of the state
of Culture after the 1914–18 war. It portrays the
world as being in near chaos, and diagnoses the
root causes not as spiritual or economic, but as
linguistic. Modern man is mentally confused
and cannot make sense of his world because
“words are at present a very imperfect means of
communication” and muddled communication is
the basis of all our ills. Advances in modern psychology mean, however, that “there is no longer
any excuse for vague talk about Meaning, and
ignorance of the ways in which words deceive us
. . . a Science of Symbolism has become possible.”
This what The Meaning of Meaning set out to
establish, first of all by insisting on a rigorous (and
dubious and damaging) distinction between the
scientific or “referential” uses of language and
the “emotive” uses, of which poetry is seen as the
highest form. “We need a spell of purer science
and purer poetry before the two can again be
mixed,” as Richards proclaimed in Principles of
Literary Criticism (1924).
Principles of Literary Criticism has the appearance of a technical work on the psychology of reading. However, it too is at root an alarmist vision
of postwar history. Modern man lives in chaos,
an experiential chaos: everywhere around him
Richards found confusion and “nervous strain”
caused by the disappearance of the reassurances
of religion, by the failure of science to provide a
secure substitute, and by the mass media. “The
extent to which second-hand experience of a
crass and inchoate type is replacing ordinary life
[Richards is talking about the cinema] offers a
threat which has not yet been realised,” and the
arts, especially poetry, can save us from this
degeneration by offering us a model of highly
ordered experience, of mental “balance” and
“reconciliation.” This will, however, require a
fundamental rethinking of Critical theory
because it is currently dominated by a false
notion of the aesthetic: “All modern aesthetics rests
upon an assumption which has been strangely
little discussed, the assumption that there is a distinct kind of mental activity present in what are
called aesthetic experiences.” Much of Richard’s

611
Richards began to sketch a theory of metaphor
which was to prove highly influential (particularly
for the New Critics: John Crowe Ransom and
Cleanth Brooks, for example, were later to argue
that metaphor is the key to poetry’s operations).
Equally influential and valuable was Richards’s
attempt to separate the multiple levels of meaning in literary Texts. “The all-important fact for
the study of literature,” he argued, “is that there
are several kinds of meaning,” and sense, feeling,
tone, and intention were singled out as the main
ones. From this argument much of the subtle
semantic analysis characteristic of later criticism
– notably Empson’s concept of Ambiguity –
derives. The continuing usefulness of these
attempts at “improvement in communication”
– or what Richards calls the study of “the possibilities of human misunderstanding” – is
undoubted, and survive despite the book’s most
obvious weakness, its discussion of the “problem
of belief” (how to evaluate texts whose values
we do not share). This section, which shows
Richards at his most unrealistic and fanciful,
results from his almost paranoid distrust of science, and from the consequent insistence on the
rigid distinction between literature and science
which has distorted so much twentieth-century
Critical theory, and led him to the conclusion
that beliefs in literature are “emotive” rather
than “intellectual” and that “the question of belief or disbelief, in the intellectual sense, never arises
when we are reading well.” Like his attempt in
Science and Poetry (1926) to assert that poetry does
not make statements but “pseudo-statements”
whose truth is irrelevant, this now seems simply
mistaken. Like so many twentieth-century apologists for poetry, Richards’s crusading attempt to
defend literature against Positivism ended up
denying it any purchase on the world and exiling it again to the closed aesthetic realm from
which he had set out to liberate it.
Richards published two other notable critical
works in the next few years, Coleridge on Imagination (1934), another impassioned defense of
poetry as “the supreme use of language,” and The
Philosophy of Rhetoric (1936), which is perhaps
his most balanced and sober linguistic theory.
Nevertheless, he was turning more and more
to pedagogical projects and in the late 1930s
“decided to back out of literature as a subject” and
devoted himself mainly to educational theorizing

Richards, Ivor Armstrong

book is accordingly a polemic against such
notions and the idea that beauty is an esoteric
mystery. There is no special “æsthetic state” or
“pure art value”: experiences of beauty “are
only a further development, a finer organisation
of ordinary experiences,” and we need a “psychological theory of value” to explicate that
organization: “critical remarks are a branch of
psychological remarks.”
All this was vigorous and refreshing at the
time, and Richards’s polemic served a useful
purpose in chasing off the remnants of what he
called the “poetry for poetry’s sake” school.
Disappointingly, though, the psychology with
which he replaces them now looks crude, a
stimulus-and-response behaviorism, and a theory
that the most valuable poetry is that in which
“appetencies and aversions” are brought into the
highest balance in the individual reader’s mind.
None of this has stood the test of time very
well. The basic model is too crudely mechanical
and neurological (“the mind is a system of
impulses”), and the psychology is too individualistic (Richards said, “To extend this individual
morality [of balanced impulses] to communal
affairs is not difficult,” but it is, and he never does
it). Above all, the central notion of “balance” was
never adequately defined, and when he attempted to do so, he seemed to be recommending an
ethic of passivity and Confucian quietism. This
turned out to be particularly damaging when,
often in cruder forms, it became the key evaluative term of New Criticism.
Practical Criticism (1929) was Richards’s most
influential book, precisely because it was a practical one. He argued, in what sounds like a selfcriticism of some of the wilder theorizings of
Principles, “No theory of poetry can be trusted
which is not too intricate to be applied,” and
settled down instead to detailed close analysis of
how actual readers read and how actual poems
work. The book is a record of experiments at
Cambridge in which he asked students to comment on short unidentified poems, followed by
his analysis of the ways in which they understood
or misunderstood them. This resulted in a
classification of the various “difficulties” that can
hamper good reading – sentimentality, stock
responses, doctrinal adhesions, and so on. Misapprehensions of the ways in which Metaphor
works was identified as a major difficulty, and

`Ricoeur, Paul (1913–2005) 
French philosopher. Ricoeur was a participant in almost all the
major debates in postwar continental philosophy.
After early studies in German Existentialism
and Phenomenology, Ricoeur took up the challenge of Structuralism and Psychoanalysis
in the 1960s. He emerged with an influential
hermeneutic reading of Freudian psychoanalysis,
Freud and Philosophy in 1965, where he argued
that a philosophical reading must simultaneously situate the text that it studies and be willing to be transformed by it. Freud is read as a
philosophical cotraveller of Marx and Nietzsche,
the holy trinity of the “Hermeneutics of suspicion.” Warning of the dangers of reducing the
Freud–Marx–Nietzsche combine to the vulgar
matrices of pansexualism, economics, and biologism, Ricoeur advocated instead the liberatory
potential of these thinkers. All these projects are
to be understood as extensions of consciousness
and not as detractive dismissals of consciousness. They seek to impose Spinoza’s lesson: the
slave’s understanding of his slavery leads to the
rediscovery of freedom within the constraints
of necessity. Ricoeur’s theory of interpretation
was further developed in The Conflict of Interpretations (1969).
Ricoeur’s hermeneutics is an attempt to mediate between semantics and Semiotics. Ricoeur
does not believe, as the poststructuralists do,
that the structuralist project has come to an
end. Saussure, according to Ricoeur, seeks to
demonstrate neither the arbitrariness of the Sign
in itself nor the impossibility of reference. What
Saussure offers instead, in Ricoeur’s understanding, is the intelligibility of the synchronic model

for posing certain kinds of disciplinary questions. Though Ricoeur has no problems with the
synchronic model of differential relations in
phonology, he is not convinced that the transference of the same model into semantics is
unproblematic. In The Rule of Metaphor (1977)
he studies the three different levels of Discourse: the word, the sentence, and the Text. In
so doing, Ricoeur privileges the interactive theory
of Metaphor over the substitution theory of
metaphor. Theories of metaphor, he argues,
should not make a fetish of the linguistic sign, but
should seek to explain the larger units of discourse.
Metaphors are not be found in dictionaries but
in discourse. Metaphorical meaning can then be
understood as a mode of predication rather than
as a semantic deviation from literal meaning.
Ricoeur’s debate with Derrida on metaphor
takes up precisely these points. Ricoeur indicts
Derrida for working with a sign-based model
of metaphor. In Time and Narrative (1983–8)
Ricoeur’s earlier attempt to work out a model of
metaphor that is linked to mimesis (imitation) and
muthos (employment) serves as a basis for a new
model of linguistic reference.

All human societies practice ritual, which
can be defined as repeated sequences of standardized symbolic acts in which humans seek
outcomes mediated by supernatural forces.
Ritual may be conducted by specially qualified
individuals (for example, priests, diviners, sorcerers) or by ordinary individuals. Rituals may
be public events or conducted secretly. Rituals may
be conducted to preserve the status quo or to
bring change. Rituals may seek the intervention

Others built on Durkheim’s work, notably
A.R. Radcliffe-Brown who, among other things,
pointed out the similarity between ritual sequences and the structure of spoken sentences, both
of which convey meaning and messages. The
twentieth century has seen a flourishing of studies in ritual sequence, symbolism, and performance
in many scholarly fields including psychology
(notably Freud and Jung), metalanguage (LéviStrauss), and performance (V. Turner).

`Rodney, Walter (1942–80) 
Walter Rodney
was one of Guyana’s best-known social historians and scholar/activists. His life was a relatively
short one but its impact on the world was indisputably significant. Walter Rodney’s passion for
knowledge could be seen from early in his life when
he won an exhibition to attend Guyana’s premiere
government secondary school at the time –
Queen’s College. From there Rodney moved on
to do his undergraduate work at the University
of the West Indies, Mona Campus, Jamaica,
where he received a first class honors degree in
history. Walter Rodney then traveled to London
on a scholarship, where he completed his doctoral
degree at the School of Oriental and African
Studies, London University, when he was only
24 years old.
Rodney’s doctoral dissertation was published
in 1970 by Oxford University Press as A History
of the Upper Guinea Coast 1545 to 1800. This
book was later published by Monthly Review
Press after his death. A History of the Upper
Guinea Coast remains a formidable work on the
historiography of that section of the West
African coast between Gambia and Cape Mount.
It was an attempt to recover Upper Guinea
before the advent of European influence and
subjugation, by carefully analyzing its intricate

Rodney, Walter

of deities, dead ancestors, impersonal forces, or
other sources of supernatural power. Whatever the
form, occasion, goal, or participants, rituals are
composed of specified acts performed according
to known rules within a known set of applications.
As Durkheim demonstrated, a key prerequisite for
ritual is a culturally defined boundary between
two domains, “profane” (ordinary) and sacred.
Ritual is a process for crossing that boundary. At
the outset a ritual shifts the setting, objects, acts,
and participants to the sacred. Subsequent acts
transpire in the sacred zone, and, at the end,
the ritual returns the setting to ordinary space.
There are other means of crossing into the
sacred – donning special clothes or entering a
sacred locality, for example – but ritual is probably the most common. Religion is of course a
heavy employer of ritual, though with its theology, administrative activities, social groups, etc.,
its scope is much greater than ritual. Rituals are
also conducted outside what society may define
as religion. Further, magic may not use ritual if
the process only taps supernatural power without
moving the actor(s) into a sacred context. Ritual
behavior has attracted sustained attention from
many scholarly disciplines literally for centuries.
In the nineteenth century the advent of ethnographic study of exotic societies stimulated a
genre of study that continues to flourish. Throughout, the operant assumption is that meanings
expressed in ritual and the larger cultural context
in which ritual is performed comprise a coherent
system. Decoding Symbolic meanings is complicated by frequent symbolic inversions: good
becomes evil, black becomes white. Comparing
ritual between Cultures is often illuminating.
An early benchmark in the study of ritual is
William Robertson Smith’s 1889 analysis of the
totemic feast, in which clan members consume the
totemic animal that at all other times is taboo. As
with subsequent analyses, Smith’s inquiry focused
on why what is taboo becomes permissible, on
the symbolic meaning of the component acts,
on the composition of attendees and officiants,
on the sequencing of the acts, and on the linkages between ritual elements and the society in
profane (ordinary) times.
Emile Durkheim expanded on Smith’s analysis,
examining the functions of the ritual in attaching individuals to the collective whole, acualizing
the collective conscious that composed society.

and constantly changing social, economic, and
political relationships.
From London Rodney took his first teaching
appointment in Tanzania, at the University of Dar
es Salaam, from 1966 to 1968. He later returned
to the history department at the University of
the West Indies, Jamaica in 1968, from which he
was unceremoniously expelled that same year
because of his political activism and social and
political critique of Jamaican social structure
(see Lewis, 1991 for details). From this experience
Rodney published his second book, The Groundings with my Brothers, in 1969. Groundings is a
collection of speeches which Rodney shared
with the Jamaican populace, along with some
reflections on such issues as African history and
Culture and its relevance to the Caribbean,
Black Power, and the contribution of Rastafari to
the Jamaican society.
Rodney returned to the University of Dar es
Salaam in 1968 until 1974, where he once again
vigorously joined the political and intellectual
life of that celebrated African institution of
scholarship and debate on matters of Third
World underdevelopment. It was during these
years, at the height of national liberation struggles, that Rodney wrote his most famous book,
How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, published in
1972. This book was a scathing and often didactic attack on European colonization, exploitation,
and plunder of resources on the African continent,
which Rodney concluded was responsible for the
impoverishment of the entire region. Rodney’s last
book A History of the Guyanese Working People,
1881–1905, was published posthumously by Johns
Hopkins Press in 1981. In this book the author
returned to the themes he had begun to explore
in his work on Upper Guinea. His project here
was to excavate the social and political matrix of
nineteenth-century Guyanese society, the extent
to which slavery and indentureship atomized
the working class along racial and ethnic lines,
and the nature of working-class politics which
sought to transcend these artificial and divisive
strategies of European capitalism.
Walter Rodney’s epistemological position was
quite clear. He believed that history should become a conscious part of the material experiences
of a people and inform their political aspirations. He saw the role of the historian as a conduit of historical information for the benefit of

the broad mass of workers and peasants. This was
his notion of popular history – a history which
was not merely archival but essentially connected to the quotidian struggle of ordinary people. This injunction is manifested in his attempt
to provide children with some sense of their history in a fictionalized but historically grounded
account of an Ashante migrant to Guyana in his
monograph Kofi Baadu Out of Africa, published
in 1980. He always articulated the notion that
the intellectual should be attached to the struggle at some point. His own life followed that
example.
In 1974 Walter Rodney and his family
returned to Guyana from Tanzania. He had been
promised the job of professor of history at the
University of Guyana, but the decision to hire him
was rescinded by the Board of Governors. This
board was largely government controlled. The
government was widely felt to be opposed to
Rodney’s politics and to his activism. Rodney,
however, elected to remain in Guyana, founding
the Working Peoples’ Alliance (WPA) in 1974.
Rodney and the WPA engaged in defending the
interests of the Guyanaese working class, and
was openly critical of those “who seek to deprive
that class of political hegemony.’’ This strategy
was described by Rodney as “critical exposure.”
Walter Rodney was politically engaged in this

He was killed in a bomb blast while sitting in a
parked car near to the area where he was born.
Of his death the Barbadian novelist George
Lamming remarked, “He was not the first victim
of political murder in Guyana, but the radical
nature of his commitment as a teacher and
activist, the startling promise that his life symbolized, made his death something of a novel
tragedy.” The anniversary of Walter Rodney’s
death is often used by academics, political
activists, and other organic intellectuals in the
Caribbean to renew the commitment to the ideals
by which this historian lived his short life.

`Romantic studies 
The history of Literary
criticism and theoretical declaration related
to English Romanticism begins with the major
poets of that period. Formally and informally, in
prose, Poetry, letters, and reported conversations,
Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley,
and Keats commented profoundly on their individual work and on the substance of poetry in
general. In addition to the explicit assertions formulated in Preface to Lyrical Ballads, Biographia
Literaria, and the Defence of Poetry, the Romantic
poets were obviously preoccupied with the
process of conceptualization and demonstration
related to mythopoeic experience. Subtly, the
Classical references to poeta, poesis, and poema
became integrated categories at this time: creator,
creative process, and created object did not
compete for artistic attention, but rather were
holistically aligned into comprehensive patterns
of balance and tension. Philosophic and aesthetic
ideas related to skepticism, dialectical progress and
perfection, art for art’s sake, the sublime, organic
form, and the central role of imagination were in
the forefront of attention. In essence, Romantic
writers proposed their claims in the configuration
of a heroic struggle to defend poetic conceptions
about the self and imagination against critics
who would deny such claims.
During the nineteenth century, reactions to
the grand assertions of Romantic poets ranged
from overwhelming admiration for their work to
polite acknowledgement, and, in some instances,
included distinct hostility to their poetry as well
as to the conduct of their personal lives. In the
first half of the twentieth century, poets like T.S.
Eliot and W.B. Yeats were vitally important in
establishing modern skeptical and affirmative
reactions to Romantic poetry that would strongly
affect ensuing critical and theoretical thinking.

Representing a classical tradition and its rejection
of Romantic self-indulgence, Eliot’s concerns
about imaginative excess reach forward and influence certain poststructuralist arguments. As a
counterbalance, Yeats embodies modern aspects
of the Romantic struggle for imagination and
self-definition that supports other poststructuralist
positions. In sum, both poets extend Romantic
energies by emphasizing thematic and stylistic
innovation; spontaneity in thought and feeling,
but guided by acute awareness of poetic convention, tradition, and a religious, spiritual, or mythic
past; an incorporation of external nature, including landscape and cityscape, that surpasses mere
description by centering on imagistic power
related to thought and feeling; and an implicit
or explicit reference to the quest for human
perfectibility that is inherently accompanied by
the curse of human imperfection. Perhaps more
crucial than anything else that the twentieth
century inherited is the weighty concept of
revolutionary imaginative freedom that leads not
to mythopoeic anarchy, but rather to creative
responsibility within freedom.
Additionally, radical philosophical formulations
by Nietzsche, Bergson, Husserl, Heidegger,
and Sartre analytically and provocatively point
out the intellectual and aesthetic struggle that
Modernity acquired from the Romantics, accepting and insisting upon the inherent dangers that
are associated with deep subjectivity and the
emphasis on expressive individual freedom. Early
on, cautionary voices like that of Eliot repeatedly
launched sound objections to the broad sweep of
the existing Romantic tendencies noted above,
acknowledging their powerful, seductive influence. Appropriately, they criticized the temptation
toward solipsism, narcissism, the loss of objectivity,
and the weakening of traditional humanistic and
spiritual values, in both literature and all phases
of human experience. About the same time, other
persuasive literary thinkers sought to establish
a New criticism that focused intensely on the
art work as a unique object of perception, and
largely ignored historical-biographical matters.
Under the rigorous language analysis called
Formalism, previously developed by Saussure,
Jakobson, and others, which complements New
Criticism, the hostile viewpoint of early critics
toward Romantic “excess” is qualified or muted
so that the work is independently judged against

certain distinct literary standards of value based
on organic interrelationships within a Text
such as the reader discovers through examination
of language, structure, and meaning. Of special
concern to the New Critics are the patterns of
Ambiguity, ambivalence, Tension, Paradox,
and Irony revealed through word choice,
imagery, imagistic clusters, and Symbols that
might reveal authorial intention(s). Although
the primary conceptual direction behind this
movement in criticism began to wane after 1960,
these major contributions to a strict exploration
of Romantic poetry have continued to affect the
evolving course of literary Discourse.
From 1960 to the present, the English-speaking
literary world has witnessed an eruption of
interest in the romantic writers. Led by M.H.
Abrams, H. Bloom, N. Frye, G. Hartman, and
F. Kermode, close inquiry into the claims and
accomplishments of the Romantic period have
provoked significant theoretical developments
grounded in Existentialism, Phenomenology,
Psychoanalysis, and Structuralism. Aesthetically and intellectually, Romanticism presents
itself as an enormously complex literary background from which controversial ideas related to
language, imagination, and political, religious,
and social thought can unfold. Growing out of
and distilling 150 years of critical and scholarly
thinking, decisive theoretical positions have recently emerged to inform the pattern of Romantic
discourse. Falling under the rubric of Poststructuralism, these authoritative studies include
Deconstruction, psychoanalysis, and Readerresponse criticism, on the one hand, and feminism, Marxism, and New historicism, on the
other, which span an investigative range from
highly problematic, imaginative arguments to
rather determined and ideological positions. The
suggestion here is that the ancient struggle between
Classicism and Romanticism is currently perpetuated through debates over “context” and “text.”
It is valuable to recognize that both extremes are
designed to undermine provocatively the traditional expectations about the nature of the
writer, the reader, and the text, in what could be
seen as enacting a kind of Heisenbergian principle of “literary indeterminacy.”
If structuralism rigorously analyzes the formal
relationship between elements in a text (linguistic, acoustic, imagistic, etc. that lead, in a formalist

analysis, to unified meaning), it is apparent that
a poststructuralist or deconstructive approach
can logically reverse the proposed claims by
questioning the seemingly unbiased methods
and theories upon which structuralism depends.
Such radical “transvaluation of values” systematically reveals the tenuous, deceptive certitudes
behind all critical approaches to literature and
thought, including its own. Each writer, text as
subject, and reader acts independently and
uniquely according to the individual dictates of
present consciousness, and only memory, complacent familiarity, and vague intuition give us the
illusion of objectivity and some “higher truth” than
that of personal perception. In particular, deconstructive, psychoanalytic, and reader-response
criticism indicates that authority is not found in
some abiding feature of Writing or reading;
rather, it is found in becoming alert to consciousness as performative agent in a constant
struggle to define its own “textual integrity.”
Exploring the theoretical underground they have
discovered are such challenging literary thinkers
as H. Bloom, S. de Beauvoir, P. de Man,
J. Derrida, M. Foucault, J. Kristeva, J. Hillis
Miller, and J. Lacan, to name the most prominent among many. They reverse, revise, and
often reestablish (but on an entirely unique
level) the arguments gleaned from a Romantic
past that forcefully acts on our present state of
literary and social awareness. Remarkably, a
high proportion of major contemporary critics,
scholars, and philosophers have found in Romanticism a shaping influence on the twentieth
century that urges trenchant responses.
For example, if feminist theorists seek to
recover and establish women writers from the
Romantic period or examine the conscious and
unconscious forms of feminine identity projected
through male writers, a concentrated investigation
could include representations of women’s physicality, psychological particulars of gender experience, status of discourse, and social or economic
dependency. The central question has to do with
the means whereby inclusive feminine reality in
relation to human identity is established by a
writer, particularly when there is firm evidence of
oppression caused by a system of patriarchal
thinking and behavior, as indicated in studies
undertaken by M. Jacobus, M. Levinson, B.
Johnson, and A. Ostriker. The momentous effort

617
and critics have captured incisively the intense
revolutionary spirit so appropriately associated
with Romanticism and furthered significantly,
through rigorous analysis and literary sensitivity, our awareness of intent and design in the
authors of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Radical, informative insights
have been forthcoming from critics and philosophical thinkers alike, such as one finds in
the work of Onno Oerlemans, Andrew Stauffer,
Maureen N. McLane, William Keach, Deborah
Elise White, Thomas Pfau, and Elizabeth A. Fay,
among others. They significantly augment our current understanding of Romanticism and leave us
with challenging thoughts that persist long after
our reading of their work and our rereading of
the writers they study.
Not yet exhausted, but obviously and repeatedly acknowledged by the Romantic poets and
their commentators, is the theoretical realm that
can be termed “the imaginary world of the imagining self,” an area of “truth” (not absolute, but
at least existential) that can formally be established
for writer, text, and reader, and which unqualifiedly occupies a central site in literary conceptualization. Such exploration has less to do with
conventional theories of imagination than it
does with problematic, even seemingly quirky,
processes that deal with the facticity of imagining. As a mental action in writing and reading,
imagining reveals what is “true” as grounded in
our emotions, intellects, and experiences with
the real phenomena of the world, and for our purposes, especially literary phenomena. Imagining
becomes the serious play area of the inquisitive,
critical, and creative mind that refuses merely to
convert process into product, becoming into
being; instead, the struggle for, not over, imaginative power proceeds endlessly, and its final
formulation always hovers tantalizingly in front
of, not behind us.
As noted formerly, the Romantic poets themselves were obviously preoccupied with such issues
germane to the composition of and reception to
the aesthetic object. However, what can be seen
as unique, albeit in some measure expected,
about the most recent perspectives on Romanticism is the notion that the historical inheritance from literature and philosophy forms a
parlance attempting to be “correct” about its
subject while simultaneously undermining and

Romantic studies

of feminism, then, must be that of deconstructing an overriding scheme of male values, which
should create an intense and prolonged argument
with traditional Romanticists.
Similarly, Marxism and New Historicism examine closely the distinctive cultural, economic,
legal, political, religious, and social circumstances
that surround a writer and become embedded
revelations, wittingly or not, in creative literature.
For Marxists, of course, a powerful text can
become a vital expression of individual and Class
conflict based on the strictures of oppressive and
exploitative situations, and while New Historicists prefer to avoid any one ideological bias,
they also base their work on precise historical
indicators that might inform and determine literary meaning. T. Bennett, T. Clark, A. Lui, and
J. McGann apply methods of analysis that have
enriched and complicated positively our theoretical understanding of the material basis underpinning Romantic poetry.
Other directions in literary analysis, such as
psychoanalytic and reader-response criticism,
tend to emphasize a precise regard for the Signs,
Metaphors, and symbols in language that both
consciously or unconsciously appear in the form
of narrative substance and can be identified
with authorial design. Of necessity, the verbal
behavior of an author encourages us to speculate
upon possible motivations behind Writing (the
author’s), within the Text (the fictional characters’), and beyond the text (the reader’s), as layer
upon layer of intentionality comes under investigation. Here, every text and every reading
are remarkable preparations for another text and
another reading. Like the mind itself, textual
accountability is continually in process, and
writer–text–reader are all responsible for discovering the various strategies and distinctive features
related to human consciousness. Theorists ranging from G. Bachelard and J. Lacan to D.
Bleich, S. Fish, and J. Tompkins have stimulated
avenues of thinking that are then related to Romanticism by critics such as M. Cooke, S. Curran,
F. Ferguson, K. Johnston, and S. Wolfson.
During the past turbulent decade, many fine
studies of Romantic writers continue to intensify
the focus on aesthetic, social, political, and
Gender issues that enhance greatly our understanding of Romanticism and its importance
for recent times. Contemporary literary scholars

Rorty, Richard

618
revising its own preconceptions: if we think that
the Romantic poets were “right” in poetically
projecting ahead to an approximate forecast of the
modern condition and temperament, we are also
“wrong” in thinking circularly that no further
aesthetic or intellectual contest is demanded of
them or of us. Their works stand as a constant
“invitation to the voyage,” in the words of
Gaston Bachelard.
We should not consider “Romanticism” as a
concept that is defined permanently, but rather
as an evolving phenomenon that can be tested
constantly by personal experience. The way we
interpret and understand poets like Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, and
other Romantic writers depends wholly on our
unique historical perception of the world and
the self. Most importantly, participating vicariously in these poets’ imaginary worlds, enhanced
by the theories invented and applied to them, may
bring us closer to the dynamic process whereby
we understand better our own “romantic” sensibility in conjunction with its present reality.
Perhaps Shelley’s Demogorgon is right – “The deep
truth is imageless” – but such a divine and
romantic assertion should not prevent us from
pursuing truth modestly.

American philosopher who, having trained and practiced in
the tradition of analytic philosophy (where he
was well respected for work in the philosophy
of mind and language), became important for
Critical theory by repudiating that tradition to
embrace a neopragmatism which converges with
contemporary continental theory on many major
issues. Chief among these are anti-essentialism
and anti-foundationalism, the Historicity of
human thought, the creation of “truth,” and the
ineluctable hermeneutic and linguistic dimension of experience. Rorty combines these radical
philosophical themes with a defense of bourgeois liberalism.

US concert pianist,
musicologist, critic, and cultural historian. Rosen’s
unique combination of talents has made him

619

In one respect, Haydn’s technique of expansion
in the recapitulation is less sophisticated than
Mozart’s, as it consists of a periodic return to the
first theme, largely unaltered, as a springboard for
quasi-sequential developments, while Mozart is
able to expand the phrase, or the individual

member of the larger form, as he expands the
whole. But this distinction cannot be made a
reproach to Haydn, as he has deliberately contracted the phrases of the exposition in preparation for the great expansion of the second half
of the movement: the recapitulation seems to be
made up of separate small bits of the exposition,
like a mosaic, but the spirit that put the pieces
together had a tough, dynamic conception of
the total controlling rhythm that even Mozart
could rarely attain outside opera. (Rosen, 1971,
pp. 160–1)

Beethoven in his late keyboard works is seen
making an apparently anachronistic return to
earlier “Baroque” fugue and variation forms in
order to resolve tensions that he himself had
introduced into the sonata argument proper.
And Schoenberg’s later career is presented as a
conflict between serialism itself and the melodic
structures that were still necessary to organize long
stretches of musical time: “The attempt to create
‘melodies’ against the grain of serialism restored
the necessary tension that had gone out of tonality” (Rosen, 1976, p. 111). Rosen’s musical criticism is also notable for the unembarrassed
directness with which he writes about the emotional content of these unfolding dramas: the
grief that finds expression in the twenty-fifth of
Bach’s Goldberg variations, the terror in Mozart’s
G minor quintet and late G minor symphony, or
the hallucinated anxiety in Schoenberg’s Erwartung
are described with rare candor and eloquence.
What makes Rosen’s approach particularly
instructive for modern Cultural studies is the
rigor with which he incorporates comparison –
between works, styles, epochs, art forms – into
his arguments. Not only does he turn aside
gracefully to, say, Marvell and Poussin in discussing Haydn’s pastoralism, or to Marivaux and
Goldoni in characterizing Mozart the dramatist,
but he also suggests new ways in which different
art forms can become intelligible to each other.
In Rosen’s writing, the technical language of
musical analysis is constantly animated by
another language, more general but still nuanced
and precise, in which the dynamic and temporal
complexities of art works become articulable.
He writes about the difficulties, tensions, and
paradoxes with which artists, irrespective of their
chosen medium, grapple, and about the new

Rosen, Charles

into an exemplary figure in modern interdisciplinary studies. His writing on music is
informed by both a historian’s understanding of
composition and performance as social acts, and
a performer’s fingertip knowledge of musical
meaning as it emerges, develops, and crystallizes
over time.
Rosen was born in New York City and
attended the Juilliard School of Music until the
age of eleven. Thereafter his piano teachers were
Moriz Rosenthal and his wife, Hedwig KannerRosenthal. In 1951 he made his recital debut in
New York and was awarded a doctorate at Princeton for a dissertation on eighteenth-century
French drama. His extensive discography ranges
from Bach and Haydn to Boulez and Elliott Carter,
and includes luminous accounts of Beethoven’s last
six sonatas (1972) and Diabelli variations (1977).
His writings include The Classical Style (1971),
Schoenberg (1976), Sonata Forms (1980), Romanticism and Realism (1984) (with Henri Zerner),
and The Romantic Generation (1995). There
exists also a large corpus of occasional writings,
as yet uncollected, including many program and
liner notes and a remarkable sequence of review
articles, often written for the New York Review of
Books, on a wide variety of cultural topics.
Rosen’s music criticism is informed by a keen
sense of drama at all levels of argument and
analysis. Whether he is discussing the social conditions in which sonata form was consolidated in
the late eighteenth century, the clash between
different styles inside “Romantic” musical culture,
or the buildup and discharge of tension during a
single symphonic movement, his attention is
always drawn to the placing and timing of key
events within complex processes of development. The Classical Style is a masterpiece in which
precise textual observation is combined with bold
speculative criticism, and it is Rosen’s dramaturgical imagination that holds these two elements
together. The symphonic procedures of Haydn
and Mozart, for example, are contrasted in their
different approaches to intrigue and resolution:

`Russian formalism 
A trend in Literary
criticism in Russia during the first third of
the twentieth century. It was distinguished from
previous trends in criticism by the fact that it made
the analysis of literary Text the center of its
critical investigations and emphasized the predominant significance of form and striving for the
discovery of the immanent laws of language and
literature. Historically, Russian formalism developed in two stages: the initial, Sturm und Drang
period from the mid-1910s to the mid-1920s,
and the classic stage of the second half of the
1920s.
Russian formalism originated in the practices
of OPOYAZ (the Society for Studies of Poetic
Language) in St Petersburg and was closely associated with Russian futurism. The members of

621
to Shklovsky, the artist’s task consisted of the
destruction of old, automatized poetic forms
by isolating literary objects from their usual
context.
The new form, created by an artist, removes
objects of everyday life (byt in Shklovsky’s term)
from their usual contexts and makes them
“strange,” thus forcing readers to react to them
as though they perceive them for the first time in
their lives (destroying the automatism of their
perception enabling them to see an object and
not simply to recognize it).
Another important contribution to literary
poetics was the formalists’ discussion of the
structure of literary plot in which they distinguished two components: fabula (story) and
siuzhet (plot per se). By fabula, formalists understood the totality of events and literary motifs
ordered according to their temporal succession
(as they would occur in reality) and, as Tomashevsky stressed, according to their logical
causality. Suzhet was seen as the totality of the same
events and motifs in the sequence in which they
are arranged in a literary Text. Thus, suzhet was
the liberation of events from temporal contiguity and causal dependency and their teleological
redistribution in a literary work. Fabula was
equated with material and served an artist as a
mere pretext for plot construction, a process
governed not by external causes but by internal,
formal laws.
Russian formalism assumed its classic form
in the mid-1920s when OPOYAZ was disbanded
(in 1923) and its members merged with the
Moscow Linguistic Circle led by Grigory Vinokur
and Roman Jakobson. At that time, the “Formal
school” or “method” in literary criticism (which
gave the identification to the entire trend) was
officially established on the basis of the postfuturist journal LEF, the leading organ of constructivism in Soviet art.
The cornerstone of Russian formalist theory
was an attempt to overcome the dualism of form
and content, which they tried to accomplish
by developing the notion of form as the only
expression of specificity of art and by “content”
as a nonartistic category. The members of Russian
formalism limited the notion of form to mostly
“poetic language” which, in their opinion, possessed “immanent” laws of development and
was independent of other nonliterary “rows.”

Russian formalism

OPOYAZ included V. Shklovsky, B. Eikhenbaum, and O. Brik among others. Also close to
OPOYAZ were Yu. Tynyanov, B. Tomashevsky,
V. Vinogradov, and S. Berenstein. Russian formalism emerged as a reaction to the impressionism of symbolist criticism and the academic
eclecticism of preceding literary movements.
The meetings and discussions held by members
of OPOYAZ began in the immediate pre-1914–
18 war years. The results of these discussions
were published between 1916 and 1919 in three
slim volumes titled Collections of Articles on the
Theory of Poetic Language (Sborniki po teorii
poeticheskogo yazyka). This collection, which can
be considered the birthplace of many formalist
ideas (or containing the germination of many
future formalist ideas) became a turning point in
the development of literary criticism not only in
Russia but also in Europe and America, in that
the contributing scholars turned their attention
to studying literature as an immanent structure
rather than a representation of historical reality.
In developing their views, the members of
OPOYAZ were influenced by theories of language, literature, and Culture proposed in the
works of Russian scholars A. Potebnya and A.
Veselovsky. From Veselovsky, the founder of historical poetics, formalists borrowed the notion of
independence of the subject of literary investigation from extrinsic elements: religion, philosophy,
morals, etc. The influence of A. Potebnya, the proponent of linguistic poetics in Russia, was even
more pronounced. Potebnya’s parallels between
the general structure of literary work and elements
of the word became the precursors of the formalist
concepts. Russian futurism, with its notions of
a “self-sufficient word” and neologistic, “beyonsense” language, provided the fertile soil for
the initial formalist investigations. In their early
works, like Shklovsky’s “Art as device” and Eikhenbaum’s “How Gogol’s Overcoat is made,”
formalists rejected methods of cultural-historical,
psychological, and sociological schools of criticism
and began to approach literary work as a System
of devices: a work of Art is a sum of literary
devices, a device is only a Subject of literary studies, a work of art has no connections with either
the personality of its creator or with life and the
ideology in which it was created; the development
of literature is accomplished by the “automatization” of devices and “estrangement.” According

Russian formalism

622
Proceeding from a Kantian concept of beauty
(which they acquired from the rejected criticism
of a symbolist critic, A. Bely), the formal school
considered that the reflection of reality, with its
problems and ideas, was not the task of art. An
artist created forms which by themselves transmitted his or her emotional experiences.
The most important change which Russian
formalists initiated in literary studies was their
effort to transfer the emphasis onto studying the
poetic language as such: the interplay of verbal
forms, Tropes, sounds, syntactic constructions,
etc. An artistic image was perceived as merely
a “device of poetic language.” Composition
appeared as a certain sequence in positioning of
narrative segments, a parallel was drawn between
devices of plot construction and elements of
poetic syntax (repetitions, parallelisms, etc.).
Studying literature using “precise” statistical,
linguistic methods produced remarkable results
and allowed one to explore previously unexplored questions: stylistic forms of speech and
language (Vinogradov); rhyme, meter, and composition of the verse (Zhirmundsky); the relationship between the semantic and verse construction
(Tynyanov); syntax and intonation (B. Eikhenbaum); rhythm and meter (Tomashevsky); language intonations of the futurists (Vinokur);
fabula and plot (V. Shklovsky); systematic description of the fairy tale (V. Propp); principles
of phonologic studies of verse and stylistic
semantics (Jakobson).
In the late 1920s, formalists advanced their
earlier concepts of literary work. The most important development in this respect was Tynyanov
and Jakobson’s article “Problems in studies of
literature and language” in 1928. Tynyanov
replaced the early formalist notion of a literary
work as a sum total of devices with that of a system and started to consider literature in its totality. The elements of literary work were no longer
summed up but instead related to each other.
They comprehended devices not separately but
through a dynamic relation between themselves
and the entire literary system. Each literary work
was considered a minimal system which existed
as a variable in a higher system which in turn was
a variable in the ultimate cultural system of systems. The next step was to consider the inner
literary system in the context of literary life, that

is, a concrete social milieu which in turn was
systematic. The methodology of Russian formalism was called “functional poetics.”
In the late 1920s, Tynyanov and Propp
introduced the notion of literary function which
meant that the same elements of literature
during different literary epochs had equal significance. The discussion of these questions led
later to Semiotics. The further development of
Russian formalism created a broader understanding of form and content in their unity,
especially in the works of such scholars as M.
Bakhtin and R. Jakobson, as well as in studies
of the Tartu school led by Yu. Lotman which tried
to broaden the functional poetics by including in
their analytical method the connections between
the artistic text and history of literature, Class,
and national culture, etc.
In late 1928, formalism came under attack
from the emerging influence of socialist realism,
which demanded that literature be the Communist Party’s instrument of propaganda of
socialist ideology and saw formalist insistence
on the autonomy of literature as dangerous. The
formalist approach was opposed to MarxistLeninist principles of literary criticism, which
became the basis of socialist realism (the only
acceptable method of Soviet arts). Individual
members of the formal school were forced to
renounce their mistakes: Shklovsky’s public
denunciation of formalist principles in 1930
signified the official death of formalism.
Prohibited in its home country, formalism continued its life in Western movements, like the
Anglo-American New Criticism. The formalists’
claim of the autonomy of literary studies and their
insistence on the methodological privacy of
a metaliterary approach found their complete
realization in the Structuralism and semiotics
of the second half of the twentieth century.

S

`Said, Edward William (1935–2003)
 Literary and cultural theorist. Born in Jerusalem,
Palestine, Edward Said attended schools in
Jerusalem, Cairo, and Massachusetts, and after
1963 was Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.
Since Said’s first book, Joseph Conrad and
the Fiction of Autobiography (1966), his thinking embraced three broad imperatives: first, to
articulate the cultural position and task of the
intellectual and critic. Said’s formulations in this
area, influenced by Foucault, provided a crucial
impetus to the New historicism in the 1980s,
which was in part a reaction against the tendency
of American adherents of Structuralism and
Poststructuralism to isolate literature from its
various contexts or to reduce those contexts to an
indiscriminate “textuality.” Said’s second concern
has been to examine Western Discourses about
the Orient in general and Islam in particular. His
own origin has defined a third, more immediately political commitment: to bring to light the
Palestinian struggle to regain a homeland. Some
regard him as a model of the politically engaged
scholar, while others view his enterprise as
incoherent. Rather than follow a strictly chronological pattern, this account of Said’s work will
pursue the three lines indicated above.
In Beginnings (1975) Said adapts insights from
the Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico’s New
Science (1744) to distinguish between “origin,” as
divine, mythical, and privileged, and “beginning,”

which is secular and humanly produced. An
“origin,” as in classical and neoclassical thought,
is endowed with linear, dynastic, and chronological eminence, centrally dominating what derives
from it. In contrast, a beginning, especially as
embodied in much modern thought, encourages
orders of dispersion, adjacency, and complementarity (1975, pp. xii, 373). Said defines beginning
as its own method, as a first step in the intentional
production of meaning, and as the production
of difference from preexisting traditions. For
beginning to comprise such an activity of subversion, it must be informed by an inaugural
logic which authorizes subsequent texts; it both
enables them and limits what is acceptable
(1975, pp. 32–4).
Drawing on insights of Vico, Valéry,
Nietzsche, Saussure, Lévi-Strauss, Husserl,
and Foucault, Said argues that the novel represents
the major form of “beginning” in Western literary
culture. In postmodernist literature, beginning
embodies an effort to achieve knowledge and art
using a “violently transgressive” language.
The problematics of language lie at the heart
of “beginnings.” With Derrida, Foucault, and
Deleuze, Said rejects Lévi-Strauss’s notion that
language has a “center”: rather, meaning is
produced within a political and cultural power
structure. Certain forms of writing establish rules
of admissibility (1975, pp. 16, 377). Given their
exposure of the hierarchical and often oppressive
System of language, Said places Foucault and

625
of worldly connections. In short, “Texts are a
system of forces institutionalized by the reigning
Culture at some human cost to its various
components” (1983, pp. 48–9, 53).
As implied in the foregoing statement, Said
views “culture” as intrinsically hierarchical,
defining it as a hegemonic environment in
which certain modes of thought prevail. Said is
indebted here to Foucault’s view of culture as
an institution which perpetually reinforces itself
by differentiation, or domestication, of what is
external to it (1983, pp. 8–9, 11–12). Hence
Said sees culture as that which fixes the range of
meanings of “home,” “belonging,” and “community”; beyond these are anarchy and homelessness.
It is within this opposition that Said, as hinted
in Beginnings, wishes to carve out a space of
“in-betweenness” within civil society for the
intellectual and critic. He sees the circumstances
of Auerbach’s composition of Mimesis (1968)
as prototypical of the critic’s position between
“filiation” and “affiliation”: written in exile from
its author’s own culture, Auerbach’s text was
enabled by a critically important Alienation
from the Western cultural tradition even as it
affirmed that tradition (1983, pp. 5–8). Echoing
Arnold, whose ultimate identification of culture with state authority he rejects, Said suggests
that the “function of criticism at the present
time” is to stand between the dominant culture
and the totalizing forms of critical systems (p. 5).
He articulates this in terms of the notions of
filiation (given ties of family, home, class, and
country) and affiliation (an acquired allegiance
to an alternative system of values). Said argues
that many modernist writers such as Joyce and
Eliot, having experienced the failure of filiative
ties, turned to compensatory affiliation with
something broader than the parameters of their
original situation.
Nevertheless, the passage from filiation to
affiliation can itself be coercive, the latter reproducing the generational and hierarchical securities of the former (1983, pp. 15–20, 25). This is
what has happened in academia, the university
experience effectively rehearsing filiative discipline. Critics can either engage in organic complicity with the resulting Eurocentric model for
the humanities or they can adopt an oppositional
stance which opens up to scrutiny the social and
political world (1983, p. 24). The identity of the

Said, Edward William

Deleuze within the “adversary epistemological
current” running through Vico, Marx, Lukács,
and Fanon. Following Foucault, he defines
Writing as the act of “taking hold” of language,
which means beginning again rather than taking
up language at the point ordained by tradition
(1975, pp. 13, 378 –9).
A dilemma, however, haunts this enterprise.
Said sees Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Foucault
as “passionate radicals” who viewed beginnings
not as events but as types or forces (Class,
Unconscious, Episteme). He also sees the later
French theorists Barthes, Foucault, Derrida,
and Lacan as accounting for reality in terms
of impersonal agencies (1975, pp. 51, 373–4).
According to Said, criticism should be a constant
reexperiencing of beginning, promoting not
authority but noncoercive and communal activity (1975, pp. 379–80). However, it is not clear
how Said reconciles the “impersonal” accounts of
the world offered by the “radicals” he cites with
the possibility of effective individual endeavor.
It is precisely Critical theory’s retreat into
a “labyrinth of textuality,” whereby it betrays
its “insurrectionary” beginnings in the the 1960s,
which motivates Said’s central arguments in The
World, the Text, and the Critic (1983). He sees
both the “radical” factions of the academy and the
traditional humanists as having sold out to the
“principle of non-interference” and the ethic of
professionalism, a self-domestication concurrent
with the rise of Reaganism (1983, pp. 3–4). Contemporary criticism is now politically irrelevant,
merely affirming the values of a Eurocentric,
dominative, and elitist culture (1983, pp. 25–6).
Said redefines the Text as “worldly,” as
implicated in real social and political conditions:
its most important feature is the fact of its production (1983, p. 50), the specific conditions of
which generate its capacity to produce meaning. As opposed to critical hypostatizations of
semantic “undecidability,” texts constrain their
own interpretation by placing themselves, intervening in given ideological and aesthetic conjunctures. Texts are marked by an interplay
between their speech and the contours of its projected reception. Moreover, as texts dislodge and
displace other texts, they are essentially facts of
power, not of democratic exchange (1983, pp. 39–
40, 45). Hence texts can be opposed neither to
the world nor to speech as the privileged bearer

Santayana, George

626
criticism Said advocates lies precisely in its
difference from other cultural activities and
totalizing systems of thought and method. This
“secular” criticism focuses on local and worldly
situations, opposing itself to the production of
massive hermetic or transcendent systems (1983,
pp. 26, 291). Said characterizes such criticism not
only as oppositional but also ironic, inasmuch as,
to remain criticism, it must resist its own integration into fixity or dogma. The task of criticism
is to combat every form of tyranny, domination,
and abuse; to promote noncoercive knowledge in
the interests of human freedom and to articulate
possible alternatives to the prevailing orthodoxies
of culture and system (1983, 29–30). While
Said regards Vico and Swift as protoypes of such
opposition, his characterization of Swift as
“anarchic in his sense of the range of alternatives to the status quo” might well be applied to
himself.
Interestingly, Said traces the emergence of
Eurocentrism to Renan’s transference of authority from divinely authorized texts to an ethnocentric philology which diminished the status of
semitic languages and the “Orient.” This theme
is developed in Orientalism (1978), where Said
examines the vast tradition of Western “constructions” of the Orient. Orientalism has been
a “corporate institution” for coming to terms
with the Orient, for authorizing views about it and
ruling over it. Central to Said’s analysis is that
the Orient is actually a production of Western
discourse, a means of self-definition of Western
culture as well as justifying imperial domination
of oriental peoples (1978, p. 3). Said concentrates
on the modern history of British, French, and
American engagement with primarily the Islamic
world.
Given his crucial treatment of Orientalism as
a discourse, his aim is not to show that this
edifice of language somehow distorts a “real”
Orient, but rather to display it indeed as a language, with an internal consistency, motivation,
and capacity for representation resting on a
relationship of power and Hegemony over the
Orient. The book is also an attempt to display
Orientalism as but one complex example of the
politically and ideologically rooted nature of
all discourse (1978, p. 14). Using a vast range of
examples, from Aeschylus’s play The Persians
through Macaulay, Renan, and Marx, to Gustave

von Grunbaum and the Cambridge History of
Islam, Said attempts to examine the stereotypes
and distortions through which Islam and the East
have been consumed. These stereotypes include:
Islam as a heretical imitation of Christianity (1978,
pp. 65–6); the exotic sexuality of the Oriental
woman (1978, p. 187); and Islam as a uniquely
unitary phenomenon and a culture incapable of
innovation (1978, pp. 296–8). Said’s analyses
stress the situational peculiarities of individual
writers who, in contrast to Foucault, he regards
as having a “determining imprint” (p. 23).
Said suggests that twentieth-century electronic
and postmodern America reinforces dehumanized
portrayals of the Arabs, a tendency aggravated
by the Arab–Israeli conflict and intensely felt by
Said himself as a Palestinian. In The Question of
Palestine (1979), Said, a member of the Palestine
National Council, attempts to place before the
American reader a historical account of the
Palestinian experience and plight. Covering
Islam (1981) reveals how media representations
“produce” Islam, reducing its adherents to
anti-American fanatics and fundamentalists.
Said’s later book Culture and Imperialism (1993)
continues the themes raised in Orientalism,
extending its compass to discourses on Africa,
India, and the Far East as well as Conrad, Jane
Austen, and Camus – all of which are shown as
participants in a vast system of cultural imperial
domination. Said’s uniqueness as a cultural critic
lies in the range of his interests which allows him
to explore the nexus of connections between
literature, politics, and religion in a global rather
than a national or Eurocentric context.

`Santayana, George (1863–1952) 
Spanishborn American philosopher. Born in Madrid,
Santayana was brought to America at the age of
eight and a half. He was educated at the Boston
Latin School and Harvard College. After two
years of graduate study in Germany, he returned
to America and took his doctorate in philosophy

627
technical work, Scepticism and Animal Faith
(1923), which, in a compressed form, sets forth
the concepts most fully articulated in Realms of
Being.
The four realms are not regions or elements of
being, but rather types or features thereof. The
realm of essence comprises an infinite number of
real but nonexistent and therefore immutable
and indestructible forms. Unlike Plato’s essences
or forms, Santayana’s are utterly passive. All
efficacy resides in the realm of matter, the
unformed and unconscious source of all power
and existence. The selection and embodiment of
essences by matter makes possible substance, the
formed physical world. Though matter falls into
habits, there is no rational purpose in nature, and
there are no unalterable laws; all is contingent.
Spirit (consciousness or mind) is epiphenomenal,
dependent upon matter for its being. Like
essences, spirit is impotent; it is only the psyche
or vital physical organism become self-aware. In
death, the psyche is vitiated and individual spirit
or consciousness annihilated. Because matter in
itself is unconscious, and because spirit derives
from and depends upon a vital material organism,
there can be no disembodied spirits, no afterlife,
and no God.
The realm of truth is constituted by all those
essences that become actualized as substance.
Truth is, therefore, completely commonplace,
though infinitely complex. From the point of
view of human life, however, some truths are
immensely more important than others. Our
knowledge of the truth results from our intuition
of essences symbolic of reality; we can never perceive the reality itself. Santayana’s view, therefore,
may be described as modified skepticism: though
we can never perceive reality per se, we must none
the less believe that the perceptible world exists,
which we do through “animal faith.” Santayana
is, therefore, philosophically a materialist and a
naturalist. Except in so far as consciousness is
temporarily allied to some physical organism,
nature is unconscious and indifferent to human
interests. The life of reason requires that we
accept and live in accord with this truth.
Though Santayana’s writings have been largely
neglected since his death, his views on American
democracy and culture continue to exert significant influence on students of American civilization. Today, a modest revival of interest in

Santayana, George

from Harvard in 1889. He was afterwards an
instructor and later professor of philosophy at
Harvard until his retirement at the age of 48 in
1912. He then returned permanently to Europe
to devote himself to writing. Santayana lived in
Oxford during the 1914–18 war, and afterward
in Paris and Monaco. During the early 1920s
he settled permanently in Rome. Always a bachelor, Santayana lived by a strict routine, rising
and retiring early, and devoting the full morning to writing. By the end of a long life, he
had produced an astonishing number of books
and articles on philosophical subjects, as well
as poetry, plays, essays, literary criticism, autobiography (Persons and Places, 1944–53), and a
best-selling novel (The Last Puritan, 1935).
Santayana began his career as one of the neotraditionalist or Harvard poets, but by the time
of the publication of his final book of new poems,
A Hermit of Carmel and Other Poems (1901), he
decided to abandon poetry and devote himself
to philosophy.
Santayana’s first prose book, The Sense of
Beauty (1896) – the radical thesis of which is
that beauty is the objectification of pleasure – has
become a classic in Aesthetics; however, it was
the appearance of The Life of Reason: Or the
Phases of Human Progress (five volumes, 1905–6)
that firmly established his reputation as a
thinker. Fundamental to this work is Santayana’s
adherence to the classical Greek ideal of the “life
of reason,” an anti-romantic view that the best and
most satisfying life depends upon self-knowledge
and the self-discipline necessary to a rational
harmony of the passions: the Aristotelian ideal
of sophrosune or moderation. It is an example
of Santayana’s belief that the truest philosophy
long preceded the present era, and that the best
modern thinking is that which most effectively
reflects the insights of the great ancients, particularly the Greeks, who long ago discovered
the essential truths.
Subsequent to the Life of Reason was the development of Santayana’s complete philosophical
System, something that in his earlier years he had
not conceived of producing. This philosophical
system is expressed most fully in the four-volume
Realms of Being (1927–40). To each of the four
realms – Essence, Matter, Truth, and Spirit –
Santayana devoted an individual volume. The
system is preceded and introduced by a separate

`Sapir, Edward (1884–1939) 
American linguist and anthropologist. Sapir was born in
Germany, but his family emigrated to the United
States when he was five. While studying at
Columbia University he met Franz Boas, who
encouraged Sapir to study Native American languages and cultures. For 15 years Sapir worked
in Ottowa, researching the indigenous peoples
of Canada. He then taught at the Universities of
Chicago and Yale.
Sapir did important work in phonology and
historical linguistics, and on the classification of
the indigenous languages of America. His name
is sometimes linked with that of Benjamin Lee
Whorf though statements rejecting the “Whorf
hypothesis” can be found in his writings. Sapir
also contributed significantly to anthropology,
notably on the relation between Culture and
society, and to Jewish studies. He read widely
in psychiatry and Psychoanalysis, and wrote
papers on the relation between culture and personality. His poems appeared in many places,
and he wrote several musical works.
Sapir’s introductory textbook Language (Sapir,
1921), is an elegant and attractive book that is
still often recommended as an introduction to
linguistics. Although Sapir and Leonard Bloomfield are usually regarded as the main architects
of structuralist linguistics in North America (see
Language theories), Sapir’s broader range of
scholarly interests meant that much of his
influence was in anthropology and Cultural
studies, while Bloomfield’s was stronger in
linguistics. History has been kinder to Sapir,
however: students nowadays tend to hear about

the strengths of Sapir’s work and the weaknesses
of Bloomfield’s. This is largely because Bloomfield
avoided psychology, thinking it unscientific,
whereas Sapir reveled in it. In circles where the
buzzword is “cognitive,” Sapir is frequently mentioned as an important intellectual forerunner.
Sapir combined scholarly rigor with a rare
humanist breadth of interest and understanding. For appreciations of his work, see Koerner
(1984).

`Sartre, Jean-Paul (1905–80)
 French philosopher and writer, closely associated with the
philosophy of Existentialism. He is also known
for his plays and novels in which philosophical
issues are often to the fore. Later in life he
became increasingly absorbed in theoretical and
practical politics. Important influences on him
are Descartes, Kant, Husserl, Hegel, Jaspers, and
Heidegger.
In Being and Nothingness (1943) he addressed
philosophical problems regarding the universal
aspects of the individual human consciousness
and its relation to the world, but later in life
became increasingly concerned with questions
of social anthropology, the relations of groups,
and believed that his ideas must become more
socially responsible, which led him to attempt
a rapprochement of existentialism and Marxism.
Sartre, following Husserl, accepts that the distinguishing feature of consciousness is “intentionality”: conscious awareness is always directed
to an object of attention. He rejects the idealism
latent in Husserl’s Phenomenology and insists
that the object of one’s attention in a conscious
act must be something that is not-consciousness.
He suggests, as had Heidegger, that the world has
significance for us only through our concrete
being-in-the-world as actors with specifically
human concerns, purposes, and needs. Such a
world is logically prior, and is in no way inferior to the scientific world and metaphysical

determined and made intelligible by their defining essence; they are all and only what follows
from their essence. Nausea describes a nightmare
world in which things are starkly revealed as
slipping out of being captured by our organizing
categories and in which contingent causal laws
break down.
Sartre’s promised book on Ethics failed to
materialize. However, one ethical consequence
might be the duty upon us not to reify the
Other, by “The Look,” as a being-in-itself, for
in that way we fix others and deny their freedom.
Nevertheless, it is difficult for us to resist this
temptation because in fixing others as things we
simultaneously undermine the other’s ability to
fix ourselves.

`Saussure, Ferdinand de (1857–1913)
French theorist who became professor of linguistics at the University of Geneva. His Course in
General Linguistics (1983), which was collated
after his death by his colleagues and students, is
considered a landmark text in the development
of linguistics as a science, and as the foundation
of Structuralism and Semiotics.
Saussure’s insight is that language is a system
which is constituted by a relation of difference.
There is an irreducible difference between the
signified (the real-world object) and the signifier
(the lexical item which refers to the object). The
theory of the linguistic Sign which he derives from
this initial distinction states that the sign is the
arbitrary relation between signifier and signified.
What comprises a sign system such as a language
is the difference between the signs, not any natural relation of signifier to signified. The sign has
meaning only in its difference from other signs.
The investigation of these differential relations is
to be the sole province of the science of linguistics. This theory has the advantage of realizing

Saussure, Ferdinand de

speculation which aim at a view of the world
stripped of the distorting contingencies of the
human perspective, one that is a passive pure disinterested spectatorial account of things, delivering the truth about the world as it is in itself; such
an alienating view is parasitic on the world that
emerges from our being-in-the-world.
Sartre insists that consciousness, being-foritself, is not a thing at all, but defines itself
through its negation (nothingness) in not being
the nonhuman thing, being-in-itself, of which it
is conscious. The interdependence of consciousness and a significant world undercuts dualism and
the problem of our knowledge of the reality of the
external world. Similarly our knowledge of other
minds is presupposed in certain aspects of our
consciousness of ourselves as a being-for-others,
whereby we are aware of ourselves as an object
of consciousness for others. These three modes of
being are Sartre’s complete and uneliminable list
of ontological categories.
Sartre concludes that we are forced to be free.
Human consciousness is what it is not, and is
not what it is. We have no fixed predetermining
essence, no prior “real selves,” but rather make
ourselves what we are only through what we do.
We alone are responsible for what we choose to
do and cannot pass the responsibility to any
external authority in an attempt to escape our freedom; but it does not follow that we can act only
irrationally. To act in “bad faith” is to attempt
to evade our freedom while at root knowing
that we cannot. Although conditioned by the
“facticity” or circumstances of our situation,
we have always the possibility of choice. To live
in full awareness of our freedom is to act with
authenticity. Only in death does an assessment
of what kind of person someone is become fully
legitimate.
In Nausea (1938) the existence and nature of
the world in its full particularity are not intelligible or explicable: things are said to be “absurd”
or “superfluous.” Particular things exist and
have features which are not deducible from their
falling under essences or universal concepts; the
categorization of a thing as falling into a class
of things gives no intelligible explanation of the
existence and the individualizing features of a
thing. Particulars are ultimately unknowable and
science is a simplifying fiction. Nonexistent ideal
objects, such as triangularity, are completely

Saussure, Ferdinand de

630
that meaning is socially produced, rather than
simply given.
Saussure is aware that the kind of science he
envisages would require to be synchronic in its
approach rather than diachronic, that is, it would
pay attention to the state of a language at any one
moment rather than to its historical evolution (see
Synchrony/diachrony). The method by which
this is to be achieved is the distinction between
Langue/parole. The utterance of an individual,
parole, is assumed to be simply the product of the
generality of the language available at that time,
and so is ignored in favor of the commonality itself,
langue. Saussure’s method therefore privileges the
abstract langue over the individual parole. This is
wholly in keeping with the structuralist impulse
which powers his work, since the intention is to
discover objectively verifiable laws. The relationship between the two is assumed to be stable. In
fact, Saussure moves beyond this premise to a
reference to a sort of collective unconscious
which ultimately underpins all linguistic activity,
a claim which is similar to that made later by
Claude Lévi-strauss and structural linguists
and literary theorists.
Given these concerns, it is unsurprising that his
project almost completely ignores the problem
of historical change: in fact, he goes so far as to
acknowledge this and to privilege his science of
linguistics over the merely contingent. It is this
maneuver which constitutes the moment of his
production of structural linguistics in opposition
to the historical grammarians who were his predecessors and contemporaries. The symptom of
this founding movement is a relatively simplistic
approach to the problems posed for his assumptions by the written world – the literary text (see
Derrida, 1976). In the chapter on the aims of
linguistics, he concentrates on the verbal, but
recommends that the written should not be
neglected. This relegates written records to the
status of secondhand witnesses, and privileges
verbal communication because of the presence of
the person making the utterance. For Saussure,
linguistics should discover the fundamental logic
which operates permanently and universally in all
languages.
The structuralist assumption that such laws
exist is obvious here. However, the vocabulary
which he utilizes reveals more than this: his
project is a moralizing one. The linguist is to

denounce errors, to eradicate them, presumably
in the name of an all-encompassing structure.
And the object of his attack is the written word,
which he sees as ossifying linguistic structure. He
treats the written sign as unnaturally stable in its
appearance, which of course ignores changes in
orthography. He asserts that the visual has more
psychological impact than the auditory, and so a
literary language gives even more “unwarranted”
attention to the written. The structuralist concern
with the scientifically objective, the concretely
definable, here produces a moralism which
ultimately can be seen as an attempt to replace
God with Structure. In his linguistics Saussure
destroyed once and for all the notion that meaning is somehow derived from an ultimate guarantor, a transcendental locus. However, he also
attempted to assert that nevertheless there is
something which exists at a fundamental level
(perhaps in the biological makeup of the human
brain, which structures the functions of the
human mind, as in later forms of structuralism).
This something is an ultimate structure and his
call for a linguistic science which will once and
for all define all language use is predicated upon
this assumption. It also makes his linguistics
course read like nostalgia for the lost presence
which it has revealed to be an empty space,
and this is one of the points with which
Deconstruction develops.
The structuralists who come after Saussure do
not take his work at face value, but rather utilize
it as a point for departure. Thus, for example,
Roman Jakobson sees Saussurean linguistics as
unnecessarily programmatic. Jakobson criticizes
Saussure’s privileging of one term of the many
Binary oppositions he uses, such as his insistence on langue over parole. But, in common
with other structuralists, he does not disagree
with Saussure over the fundamental interests of
his work, accepting his positing of a structure
which ultimately defines all linguistic usage.
Despite his interrogation of the uses Saussure
makes of binary opposition in his theory,
Jakobson does not question the concept itself. In
this way Saussure’s work serves to provide structuralism with most of its basic concepts, even as
they engage with their denial of some of the uses
he himself makes of these concerns. Similarly, some
of the implications of Saussure’s work have been
picked up by Poststructuralism, implications

`Scarry, Elaine (1946–) 
North American
philosopher, cultural theorist, and literary
scholar. Scarry is the Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of
Value at Harvard University, where she teaches
Aesthetics, and American and English language
and literatures. Her research interests extend far
beyond traditional boundaries of the philosophical and literary. She has written on a diverse
array of subjects, including human rights, 9/11,
national security, airplane crashes, imagination,
medicine, representations of pain in advertising,
war, weapons of mass destruction, torture, and
Constitutional law. The most remarkable quality
of Scarry’s interdisciplinary work is its constant
concern with Ethics, and commitment to social
and political justice.
Scarry’s most definitive work is The Body in
Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World
(1985). It is an extraliterary ethical project about
the inexpressibility and reality-altering consequences of physical pain, and the importance of
inventing linguistic representation to accommodate the felt-experience of pain. The Body in
Pain has been lauded by Amnesty International
and other human rights groups and scholars for
its effort to put pain into political and historical
perspective. Contrary to the commonly held
belief that suffering inspires art, Scarry writes
that pain is an unsharable, incommunicable,
and isolating phenomenon. When pain invades
the body it resides entirely within, shattering the

contents of consciousness, and demanding the
full attention of its victim. For the tortured
sufferer, the felt-experience of pain is overwhelming and undeniable. Pain robs the sufferer
of voice, the usual mechanism of self-extension
and self-expression, isolating the self and making
it conterminous with the body. For the person who
is not experiencing pain, the pain of another is
virtually unknowable, and, therefore, almost
always doubtable. Pain is a unique interior state
in that it has no object beyond the boundaries
of the body. For Scarry, to create linguistic structures for pain would be to transform it into
an objectified state (make it knowable to persons
other than the sufferer), and thereby, lessen
suffering.
Scarry’s later work has ethical concerns at
heart as well. In On Beauty and Being Just (1999),
Scarry presents arguments about beauty in relation to truth and justice. She writes in response
to scholars who criticize beauty on political
grounds and who fall into two categories: those
who believe that beauty distracts us from social
injustices and so leads to indifference, and those
who believe that the act of looking at a beautiful
thing destructively objectifies it. Scarry rejects
these arguments, and claims that by affecting us
perceptually beauty, shakes us from our usual selfcenteredness and directs our attention outward.
An admirer enters into a mutually beneficial
life-giving relationship with a beautiful object,
in which each offers the other a continuation
of (it)self. Beauty enhances our interior lives;
its “elasticity” incites in us the forward desire
to create, or “bring new things into the world,”
at the same time that it prompts us to search
backward in the effort to recall other beautiful
things. (In this way, what is beheld as beautiful
is infinite, a “salute to continued existence”).
In admiring an object we offer it protection and
aliveness by cherishing, caring for, or sharing it.
Beyond this life-giving exchange, however, beauty
is an “invitation to fairness” that increases our
moral aspirations. With symmetry as one of its
most recognizable qualities, beauty is a visual
manifestation and reminder of even distribution, equality, and balance.
Scarry’s boldest endeavor to date is a series of
articles published in The New York Review of
Books. In the first of these articles “The fall of TWA
800: the possibility of electromagnetic interference,”

which went unnoticed by the structuralists themselves. In particular, the notion of the arbitrary
sign which is structured by difference produces
a whole theory of the dissemination of meaning
which marks a radical departure from Saussure’s
structural impulse. In this way the theoretical
shift which he marks continues to resonate in
Cultural theory.

Scarry called for the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) to investigate the possibility that electromagnetic interference (EMI) from
a P-3 Orion aircraft caused the July 1996 crash
of TWA 800. She also asked that military studies
on EMI be made available to the public through
the NTSB’s official inquiry into the crash.
Eventually, the NTSB allocated several hundred
thousand dollars for new EMI research. Two and
a half years later, in “The fall of EgyptAir 990,”
Scarry noted that within a three-year, threemonth period of time, the only three passenger
planes that crashed during take off in the United
States (TWA 800, SwissAir 111, and EgyptAir 990)
each left JFK and reported problems or crashed
within 31 minutes of departure. She went on to
suggest that the environment external to the
three planes, which was not electromagnetically
neutral, be reconstructed and studied for the
possibility of having contributed to the crashes.
Though numerous renowned physicists, biophysicists, and biochemists supported Scarry in
her work, she came under attack by scientists and
engineers who considered her EMI hypotheses
to be implausible, and who rebuked her for
encouraging the irresponsible expenditure of
resources based on the “unfounded speculation”
of a non-scientist.
Even amidst the criticism of her EMI
research, Scarry’s work offers a model of academic and civic responsibility. Her proactive
approach to the pursuit of truth and knowledge
is a reminder of the generative, world-changing
possibilities of inquiry, investigation, and
scholarship.

`science, philosophy of 
What is the status
of scientific truth claims? Can they purport to
hold good for all time across vastly differing
contexts of language, Culture, and society?
That is to say: is science in the business of providing valid explanations of physical objects and
events whose nature remains constant despite
such deep-laid shifts of cultural perspective? Or
is it not rather the case – as currently argued by
relativists, pragmatists, and “strong” sociologists
of knowledge – that those contexts provide the
only means of understanding why science has
taken such diverse forms (and come up with
such a range of competing “truths”) throughout
its history to date?
These questions are of interest not only to
philosophers and historians of science but also,
increasingly, to cultural and critical theorists
influenced by the widespread “linguistic turn”
across various disciplines of thought. They are
often linked with the issue of ontological relativity, that is, the argument – deriving principally
from W.V.O. Quine’s famous essay “Two dogmas
of empiricism” – that there exist as many ways
of describing or explaining some given phenomenon as there exist ontological schemes or
Systems for redistributing predicates over the
entire range of sentences held true at any

633
high-level theories – are intelligible only in terms
of the prevailing consensus, or according to the
overall framework of beliefs that provides its own
(strictly immanent) criteria of truth, progress,
theoretical consistency, evidential warrant, and so
forth. However, it then becomes difficult – if not
impossible – to explain how we could ever gain
insight into scientific world views other than our
own; or again, how historians of science could ever
claim to understand the reasons (that is, the
scientific grounds) for some decisive paradigm
shift, as distinct from the various short-term
cultural, social, or historical factors that may
have played some part in bringing them about.
Hence Quine’s recourse to the idea of “radical
translation” as a means of (purportedly) bridging
this otherwise insuperable gulf between different
observation languages or ontological schemes.
Hence also the difficulties that Kuhn confronted
in his 1969 Postscript to The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions (1970) when responding
to his critics on the issue of relativism and its
self-disabling consequences. For it is far from clear
that these difficulties are in any way resolved by
his Quinean (radical-empiricist) line in the face
of such strong counterarguments.
This problem is yet more acute with the kinds
of ultrarelativist position adopted by proponents
of the present-day “linguistic turn” in its fully
fledged (postmodern) guise. Thus it is sometimes
claimed – for instance by Richard Rorty – that
our best model for interpreting the process of
scientific paradigm change is what happens
when poets and novelists come up with striking
new “metaphors we can live by,” or again, when
strong-revisionist literary critics interpret such
metaphors after their own fashion. Then again
there are those – Paul Feyerabend chief among
them – who espouse an anarchistic philosophy
of science which rejects all appeals to truth,
logic, reason, consistency, experimental proof,
etc. According to this view the idea of scientific
“progress” is nothing more than a piece of bogus
mythology, one that takes hold through our
myopically equating “truth” with what currently
counts as such according to this or that (selfauthorized) “expert” community. It is much
better, Feyerabend thinks, to have done with this
misplaced reverence for science and instead take
account of the various factors – social, political,
psychological, careerist, and so forth – which

science, philosophy of

particular time. According to this holistic view
there is no means of drawing a firm, categorical
line between synthetic and analytic propositions,
or matters of empirical (contingent) truth which
might always be subject to revision in the light
of further evidence, and on the other hand those
so-called logical “laws of thought” whose truth
is assumed to be a matter of a priori necessity
and hence – by definition – valid for all possible
contexts of inquiry. With the collapse of this
distinction, so Quine argues, we must also let go
of the idea that philosophy of science might yet
come up with an adequate method for linking
observation sentences to theories (or vice versa)
through a clear-cut set of logical procedures. For
in a holist perspective those sentences can possess
meaning – that is to say, be assigned determinate
truth values – only as a function of their role within
the entire existing “fabric” or “web” of beliefs,
or the entire set of truth claims (“empirical” and
“logical” alike) that currently happen to command
widespread assent. This is really to say that there
are no such determinate truth values since
theories are always at some point “underdetermined” by the best evidence to hand, while
that evidence is always “theory-laden” – or committed to some prior ontological scheme – right
down to the level of its basic data as given in firsthand observation sentences. Thus for Quine it
follows that one must apply a principle of strict
ontological parity as between (for instance)
Homer’s gods, centaurs, numbers, set-theoretical
classes, and brick houses on Elm Street. Any
preference in the matter – and Quine admits
readily that he has a whole range of such preferences – must in the end come down to one’s
particular choice of ontological scheme.
There are many other sources of this relativist
trend in contemporary philosophy of science.
They include Thomas Kuhn’s highly influential
account of the way that science alternates between
periods of “normal” and “revolutionary” activity,
the former characterized by broad agreement on
what counts as a proper (constructive and disciplined) approach to certain well-defined problems,
the latter by a sense of impending crisis – and
an absence of agreement on even the most basic
principles – which heralds the transition to a
new epoch. Here, as with Quine, it is taken for
granted that all the components of a given scientific
“Paradigm” – from observation sentences to

science, philosophy of

634
have always played a decisive role in the history
of scientific thought. We can then see how
mixed were the motives (and often how random
or opportunist the methods) which gave rise to
some so-called discovery or advance that is
nowadays treated as a textbook example of its kind.
This will bring two great benefits, as Feyerabend
sees it. First, it will help to demythologize science
– to remove some of its false prestige – and
thereby open it up to criticism from other (that
is non-“expert” but socially and ethically more
responsive) quarters. Second, it will encourage scientists to become more adventurous in framing
risky conjectures or in pursuing novel and
hererodox lines of thought.
There are various explanations that might be
adduced for the current appeal of such ideas.
One is the widely held view that philosophy of
science can no longer have recourse to any version of the logical positivist (or logical empiricist)
distinction between truths of observation on the
one hand and self-evident (tautologous) truths of
reason on the other. There are similar problems
– so it is argued – with the appeal to deductivenomological (or covering-law) theories, those
which would seek to account for observational
data by bringing them under some higher-level
(metalinguistic) order of logical entailment relations. Here again the way is open for skeptics
like Quine to argue that any such distinction will
always be drawn according to some preferred
ontological scheme, some language or culturespecific set of descriptive or explanatory priorities. One alternative that has enjoyed wide
favor, not least among practicing scientists, is
Karl Popper’s hypothetico-deductive account,
whereby the measure of a theory’s claim to genuine scientific status is not so much its truth
as established by the best current methods of
experimental testing, but its openness to falsification by those same methods. This account has the
signal advantage of explaining how a great many
scientific theories that once enjoyed widespread
credence eventually have turned out to be mistaken,
or – as with Newton’s conceptions of absolute
space and time – “true” relative only to a certain
restricted spatio-temporal domain. It thus meets
the criticism of those like Feyerabend, who would
exploit such evidence to the point of denying
that notions of truth have any role to play in the
history and philosophy of science.

Nevertheless, there are difficulties with Popper’s
position, among them its reliance on underspecified criteria of what should count as a
decisive falsification (or as grounds for rejecting
some candidate hypothesis) in any given case.
In other words, the methodology of “conjecture
and refutation” – as Popper describes it –
amounts to just a minor inverted variation on
the positivist or logical-empiricist theme. Moreover, so his critics maintain, Popper has made
illicit use of this dubious methodology in order
to attack what he sees as the pseudoscientific
pretensions of Marxism and other such “historicist” trends in the sociological, interpretative,
or humanistic disciplines. If there is one type
of argument that always draws fire from the
present-day cultural relativists, it is the idea that
science should enjoy any privileged truth-telling
status, any method or set of validity conditions
that would place it apart from those other (on its
own terms) less rigorous or rationally accountable modes of knowledge. Such is the distinction
standardly drawn between the “context of discovery” for scientific truth claims and the “context of justification” wherein those claims are
subject to testing by the best available criteria of
experimental warrant, theoretical consistency,
causal-explanatory yield, and so forth. However,
this distinction is rejected by those who maintain
– whether on grounds of “ontological relativity”
or in pursuit of the so-called strong program in
Sociology of knowledge – that truth is just a
product of localized beliefs whose origin should
be sought in their cultural context or in the
sociobiographical history (the professional interests, careerist motives, childhood experiences,
religious convictions, etc.) of the scientists who
held them.
The poet W.H. Auden nicely epitomized this
genre in its vulgar form: “A penny life will give
you all the facts.” More sophisticated, though
no less sophistical variants would include
Feyerabend’s well-known claim that in the case
of Galileo versus Cardinal Bellarmine and the
church authorities it was not so much an issue of
truth – that is, of the heliocentric hypothesis as
against the geocentric – but simply a question of
who had the better argument on rhetorical,
social, or political grounds. Thus if Bellarmine
sought to promote the interests of communal
stability and peace, while Galileo can be shown

635
habits of thought as to leave little hope of effective reform. More recently the “puzzle of induction” has been restated in various elaborate and
ingenious guises, some of them due to the
philosopher Nelson Goodman. Even where not
thus intended, they have all served to reinforce
the widespread trend toward skeptical or relativist philosophies of science which assimilate
“truth” to the shifting currency of in-place consensus belief.
However, these arguments have not gone
unopposed, as indeed one might expect, given
their strongly counterintuitive character and our
natural disposition – as Hume recognized – to
attribute something more to scientific truth claims
than mere lazy-mindedness or force of habit.
The challenge has come from various quarters,
among them the Critical Realist school of
thought, whose chief proponent is Roy Bhaskar,
himself much influenced by the work of Rom
Harré. Central to their case is a “stratified” conception of reality, knowledge, and human interests where distinctions may be drawn between, on
the one hand, a realm of “intransitive” objects,
processes, and events – that is, those which must
be taken to exist independently of human conceptualization – and on the other hand, a “transitive” realm of knowledge-constitutive interests
which are properly subject to critical assessment
of their ethical and sociopolitical character. To
conflate these realms – so Bhaskar argues – is the
cardinal error of relativist philosophies and one
that leads to disabling consequences in both
spheres of inquiry. Thus it relativizes “truth” (in
the natural and human sciences alike) to whatever form of Discourse, or de facto regime of
instituted power/knowledge, happens to prevail
in some given discipline at some given time. It also
undermines any critical questioning of scientific
projects, investigations, or research programs
that would argue in terms of their ethical implications or their consequences for human individual
and collective well-being. Such criticism can
have no purpose, no grounds or justification,
if it fails to take adequate (realistic) account of
what science can or might achieve on the basis
of present knowledge and research.
So Bhaskar has a twofold reason for maintaining his “transitive”/“intransitive” distinction. It is
necessary, first, as a condition of possibility for
science and also (a fortiori) for the history and

science, philosophy of

to have fudged certain details (observational
data) in order to preserve his theory, then the
church comes off rather better on balance and –
so Feyerabend advises – should even now stick
to its doctrinal position and not lean over to
accommodate the present-day scientific orthodoxy.
Other versions of this argument (if rarely pushed
to such a provocative extreme) are often to be
found in the current literature on history and sociology of science. What they all have in common
is the nominalist persuasion that “truth” is just
a term honorifically attached to those items of
belief that have managed to prevail, by whatever
strategic or rhetorical means, in this contest for
the high ground of scientific “knowledge” and
“progress.” Other sources include the “social
construction of reality” thesis (taken up in philosophy of science by writers like Barry Barnes
and David Bloor); the skeptical Genealogy of
power/knowledge essayed across a range of disciplines by Michel Foucault; and the argument
of postmodernist thinkers such as Jean-François
Lyotard that science is just one among a range
of incommensurable language games (cognitive,
ethical, historical, political, etc.) and no longer
exerts any privileged claim on knowledge or
truth.
We have seen already how such skepticism
extends to philosophies of science that invoke some
form of deductive warrant from covering-law
theories or hypotheses framed with a view to
experimental proof or refutation. However, the
same sorts of objection have also been brought
against inductivist arguments, that is, those
which take the opposite route, seeking to derive
generalized descriptive or explanatory accounts
from observed regularities in this or that physical
domain. David Hume was of course the first to
remark upon the problems that arise in offering
any adequate (that is, more than “commonsense” or probabilistic) defense of inductive
procedures. As he saw it, our ideas of causality
came down to just a matter of regular succession,
contiguity, and “constant conjunction,” or our
indurate belief that if one event normally follows
another in the order of phenomenal experience,
then this must be due to some intrinsic causal
nexus or relationship between them. This fallacy
(post hoc, propter hoc) was for Hume the product of a manifest non sequitur, albeit one so deeply
embedded in our everyday as well as scientific

science, philosophy of

636
philosophy of science. That is to say, these
projects would be simply unintelligible in the
absence of a presupposed object domain which
is not just a construct out of our various (for
example, linguistic, discursive, historical, or
cultural) schemes. Where the relativists err is in
confusing ontological with epistemological issues.
Thus they take the sheer variety of truth claims
advanced (and very often subsequently abandoned) down through the history of scientific
thought as evidence that no truth is to be had,
and that nothing could justify such claims aside
from their own “internalist” perspective on issues
of truth, realism, progress, adequate explanation,
etc. And so indeed it must appear if, as in
Wittgenstein’s resonant but not very helpful
phrase, “the limits of my language [for which read
“discourse,” “paradigm,” “conceptual scheme,”
or whatever] are the limits of my world.” However, this conclusion holds only on the mistaken
premise – as Bhaskar sees it – that ontology
(questions like “what things exist?” “what are
their real attributes, structures, generative mechanisms, causal dispositions, etc.?”) is synonymous
with epistemology (“how does such knowledge
come about?”, “according to what criteria?”
“within what limits of human cognitive grasp
or knowledge-constitutive interest?”). From this
follows his second main point against the relativists: that by confusing these questions they
deprive criticism of any effective purchase on
the way that science has actually developed to date
and the extent to which, within practical limits,
its potential may be harnessed for the communal good.
These objectives both find expression in the title
of Bhaskar’s best-known book, Scientific Realism
and Human Emancipation. Here he argues that
relativist (or anti-realist) doctrines may well
start out with the laudable aim of opposing that
narrowly positivist conception of science which
excludes any concern with ethical issues by reducing truth to a matter of purely instrumental (or
means–end) rationality. However, their proposed
alternative is not much better, amounting as it
does to a species of cognitive skepticism devoid
of critical content and lacking any basis for
informed evaluative judgment. Thus it simply reproduces all the well-worn puzzles – like Hume’s
problem of induction – which result from a
reified conception of the physical object domain

joined to a passive spectator theory of knowledge.
Bhaskar is not alone among recent philosophers
of science in arguing the case for a return to
causal-explanatory modes of understanding.
Wesley Salmon offers numerous convincing
examples of advances that have resulted from
the achievement of a deeper, more adequate
grasp of precisely such underlying causal mechanisms. These advances include, for instance, the
capacity to define and measure heat in terms
of the mean kinetic energy of molecules; the
understanding of electrical conductivity as the
passage of free electrons; or the characterization
of the color “blue” as that which pertains to wavelengths within a given frequency range (as distinct,
say, from Plato’s idea that blue objects were perceived as such on account of their participating
in the Form or the Essence of blueness).
Thus the case for causal realism, in Nicholas
Rescher’s words, is that “every objective property
of a real thing has consequences of a dispositional
order,” even if, as he readily concedes, they
“cannot be surveyed in toto.” The latter is in fact
not so much a concession as a further strong
argument for the realist case. That is, our chief
evidence for the mind-independent status of
real-world objects is precisely their possession of
attributes, properties, causal dispositions, etc.
which may turn out to be not what we expect
according to our present state of knowledge. In
that case, as Rescher shrewdly points out, the
relativist “argument from error” (namely, that
scientists have often been wrong in the past so
could just as well be wrong all the time) is one
that fails to stand up. It is not so much an argument against scientific realism as an argument
against “the ontological finality of science as we
have it.” Thus Caesar did not know – could not
have known – that the metal of his sword contained tungsten carbide and that this was an
explanatory factor in its fitness for the purpose
intended. Moreover we can now give additional
reasons (molecular and subatomic) for the fact that
certain metals or metallic compounds possess
certain well-tried physical qualities.
Nor are such claims in any way confounded by
the high probability – indeed near-certainty – that
future science will come up with yet further, more
detailed or depth-ontological explanations. This
does not alter the knowledge we have that our current explanation is better (more adequate) than

637
speak) in reverse, starting out with some relatively
abstract conjecture regarding the existence of
as yet unobservable entities, and then seeking
to verify its claims by experiment or further
research. Thus, as Newton-Smith notes, the term
“electron” was at first a “predicate . . . introduced
[by Roentgen] with the intention of picking out
a kind of constituent of matter, namely that
responsible for the cathode-ray phenomenon.”
Thereafter it not only “entered the vocabulary”
of theoretical physics, as a relativist might choose
to phrase it, but also attained the status of a
necessary postulate and then (with Rutherford’s
pioneering work) that of an entity whose passage
could be tracked and whose causal-explanatory role
placed its existence beyond reasonable doubt.
The same is true of a range of other items – such
as molecules, genes, DNA proteins, and viruses –
which have likewise exhibited a power to explain
what previously lacked any adequate account.
This is the chief virtue of a realist approach,
according to Rescher: that it pays due regard to
the prior claims of a “non-phenomenal order
from which the phenomena themselves emerge
through causal processes.” For otherwise, lacking such grounds, we should have absolutely no
reason to think that electrons (or molecules,
genes, viruses, etc.) exerted any greater claim
upon our credence than phlogiston, magnetic
effluxes, or the luminiferous ether.
At this point the relativist will answer – most
likely with reference to Kuhn – that those grounds
are indeed lacking since there is no guarantee of
the meaning invariance of terms from one theory
to the next. If it is true (as Kuhn thinks, following Quine) that all terms are “theory-laden,”
object languages and observation statements
included, and moreover that theories are radically “underdetermined” by the evidence, then
it follows that scientists perceive different objects
under different theoretical descriptions. Thus, for
instance, the ancient atomists were in no sense
talking about the “same” entities as those later
physicists (from Dalton to the present) who have
themselves come up with such a diverse range of
models, metaphors, “elementary” particles, etc.,
as to render their theories strictly “incommensurable.” Again, to take one of Kuhn’s best-known
examples: Priestley and Lavoisier each laid claim
to have discovered the chemical process of combustion, although the latter based his account

science, philosophy of

anything available to Caesar. (See especially
Muntz, 1985; Ruben, 1982; and Lipton, 1993.)
That is to say, we have rational warrant for
supposing that the objects, theories, and causal
postulates used in our own best constructions are
closer to the truth than what Caesar (or the scientific experts of his time) might have counted
an adequate hypothesis. No doubt it is true that
any gaps or shortcomings in our present state of
knowledge might yet be revealed by some further
advance – some improvement in the means of
observation or the powers of theoretical synthesis
– which rendered that knowledge either obsolete
or henceforth restricted in its range of application.
The most obvious example is that of Newtonian
physics in the wake of relativity theory, where
classical conceptions of gravity or absolute space
and time continue to play an explanatory role,
albeit under certain limiting conditions or in
certain specified regions of inquiry.
Such instances are often adduced in support of
the standard relativist claim, namely, that there
exist as many ways of construing the phenomena
as there exist scientific theories, paradigms,
ontologies, conceptual schemes, and so forth.
Nevertheless, this argument misses the point in
two crucial respects. First, it fails to note that
Einstein’s general theory of relativity itself has
recourse to an absolute value – the speed of light
– which then serves as an invariant measure for
assigning all loci in the space–time continuum.
Thus it is wrong – little more than a play on words
– to confuse “relativity” in this well-defined
sense with the kinds of all-out ontological or
epistemic relativism which Einstein strenuously
sought to avoid. And second, such arguments
ignore the extent to which past theories are often
not so much discredited en bloc as conserved and
refined by continual scientific elaboration and
critique.
Sometimes this occurs when previously wellestablished items of knowledge are shown to
possess only a partial truth or a power of explanation that is no longer adequate for present
purposes. Such would be true of, for instance, those
advances in the fields of particle physics or
molecular biology which built upon the work of
earlier physicists, chemists, and biologists, but
which reconfigured the object domain by opening up new regions of depth-ontological inquiry.
At other times this process may operate (so to

– correctly, as we now think – on the existence
of a hitherto unknown element named “oxygen,”
while the former adhered to the phlogiston
theory and produced experimental results which
fully confirmed it. Therefore, where Lavoisier
detected the existence of oxygen, Priestley talked
about “dephlogistated air,” along with a whole
set of congruent hypotheses and reasonings on the
evidence that amounted to a counterpart theory
with similar explanatory scope. Kuhn offers
many such examples, among them the difference
of views between Aristotle and Galileo regarding what we now – after Galileo – perceive as the
gravity-induced motion of a pendulum, but
what Aristotle “saw” as matter seeking out its
rightful (cosmological) place in the order of the
elements.
This is all taken by Kuhn’s relativist followers
(and arguably by Kuhn himself ) to justify a
stance of thoroughgoing cognitive skepticism
vis-à-vis the issue of scientific truth and progress.
Even so, there are obvious problems with any
strong version of the incommensurability thesis.
One is the straightforward logical point that we
could be in no position to mount such a claim
unless we were able to recognize the differences
between two rival theories, or possessed at least
some minimal ground of comparison on which
they could be said to diverge. After all, as Andrew
Collier remarks, “nobody bothers to say that
astrology is incompatible with monetarism or
generative grammar with acupuncture.” There is
also the fact – well-attested by numerous examples
from the history of science – that knowledge
accrues around certain topics across and despite
the widest differences of theoretical framework,
ontological scheme, research paradigm, or whatever. Thus it does make sense to think of modern
(post-Dalton) atomic and particle physics as
belonging to a line of descent from the ancient
atomists, even though the latter may be said to
have inhabited a different “conceptual universe,”
and to have advanced their ideas on a purely
speculative basis, devoid of genuine scientific
warrant. What enables us to draw this distinction is precisely our knowledge of the growth of
knowledge, our ability to grasp those salient
respects in which the current understanding of
atomic or subatomic structures differs from – and
has indeed advanced far beyond – the ancient
atomists’ conceptions.

Thus the Quinean/Kuhnian thesis of radical
meaning variance gives rise to some awkward, not
to say nonsensical conclusions. It would require
us to believe not only that the Greek atomists were
talking about something completely different,
but also that later physicists, such as Dalton,
Rutherford, Einstein, and Bohr, were themselves
working on such disparate assumptions as to
rule out any meaningful comparision between
them. One might perhaps be tempted to adopt
this outlook in other, more extravagant cases,
like Anaximander’s idea of the earth as “a
slab-like object suspended in equilibrium at the
centre of the cosmos.” (I take this example from
Rescher.) Even here, though, it can reasonably
be argued that we have grounds for thinking
Anaximander wrong – and subsequent thinkers
right – with respect to a given planetary body (the
earth) whose structure, properties, and place in
the solar system are now much better understood. The same would apply to a great deal of
early science, including Aristotle’s theory of
matter as composed of a mixture, in various
proportions, of the four “elements” (earth, air, fire,
and water), along with the “humours” supposedly
produced by their manifold possible combinations.
The trouble with such a theory is not that the
evidence fails to bear it out, but, on the contrary,
that it is perfectly compatible with any kind of
“evidence” that might turn up. In Popper’s terms
it is so vaguely framed as to lack the falsification
criteria – or the grounds for its own subsequent
disproof – which mark the distinction between
science and pseudoscience.
However, there is a stronger argument that
avoids the above-noted problems with Popper’s
account. This is the causal-realist theory, according to which scientific explanations are chiefly concerned with the properties of things themselves
– with their structures, effects, “transfactually
efficacious” powers (Bhaskar), etc. – rather than
the various propositions or logics of inquiry that
purport to account for them. Thus, in Bhaskar’s
words: “if there is a real reason, located in the nature
of the stuff, such as its molecular or atomic
structure, then water must tend to boil when it is
heated.” It is worth noting that this proposed shift
from a descriptive-analytic to a causal-explanatory
approach is one that finds a parallel in recent
linguistic philosophy, notably Saul Kripke’s
influential work Naming and Necessity (1980). In

639
4400Å. These are all cases of what Kripke would
call a posteriori necessity. Their names denote
precisely those sorts of occurrent phenomena –
structures, qualities, causal dispositions, etc.
– which on the one hand require our having
found out about them from experience or scientific
investigation, while on the other hand belonging
to their intrinsic (necessary) character as just
that kind of phenomenon. As Bhaskar would
claim, it is just this kind of knowledge that
enables us to make sense of science, along with
the history and philosophy of science.
Of course there are always counterexamples
which the skeptic can adduce by way of contending
that science deals only with hypothetical entities
or with constructs out of this or that preferred
ontology, conceptual scheme, etc. Such doubts
attach most often to objects (or quasi-objects) at
the leading edge of current speculative thought,
as with the various postulated items – from electrons to mesons and quarks – that have figured
in the history of modern particle physics. There
is also the question of how far science may create (rather than “discover”) such putative realia
with its own ever more resourceful techniques
for manipulating the materials at its disposal.
(Examples might be drawn from the field of
recombinant DNA technology, the new range
of particles observed – or produced – with the
advent of high-energy accelerator programs,
or from the filling-out of Mendeleev’s periodic
table with elements previously unknown in
nature.) Even so, it is true – as Ian Hacking
remarks in his book Representing and Intervening
– that such proteins, particles, or elements are possessed of both structural and causal-explanatory
attributes which define their role within an
ongoing project of scientific research. Thus some
new particle may well start out as a purely speculative construct, a hypothesis required in order
to balance the equations or to fill the gap in an
otherwise attractive and powerful unifying theory.
However, its existence will remain matter for
conjecture until that hypothesis can be proven,
perhaps by the arrival of an electron microscope
with higher powers of resolution, or an accelerator capable of achieving the required velocity. In
that case, as Hacking more succinctly concludes,
“if you can bounce electrons off it, it is real.”
Such arguments would of course carry little
weight with cultural or literary theorists, for

science, philosophy of

both cases it entails the argument that certain
words – those denominating “natural kinds” –
possess reference by virtue of their capacity to pick
out certain corresponding objects, substances,
or real-world entities. These words (“proper
names” in Kripke’s nonstandard usage of that
term) are defined as such through a chain of
transmission which at each stage relates them
back to their referent, itself “baptized” in a first
(inaugural) act of naming and thereafter subject
to various modifications or refinements in the light
of newly acquired scientific knowledge. Kripke’s
chief aim in all this is to avoid the kinds of problems that arise with descriptivist theories (like those
advanced by Frege and Russell), which make
truth values a function of reference, and reference,
in turn, a function of those meanings (or senses)
that attach to a given term. It is then a short step
to Quinean and other such forms of wholesale
ontological relativism, reached by rejecting any
clear-cut distinction between analytic (logically
necessary) and synthetic (empirical or factual)
propositions. For Kripke, conversely, there is
an order of a posteriori necessary truths which
explain the way things stand in reality and with
our knowledge of them as expressed in the form
of propositions about natural-kind terms.
Bhaskar again provides some pertinent examples from the scientific field. Thus: “if there
is something, such as the possession of the
same atomic or electronic configuration, which
graphite, black carbon and diamonds share,
then chemists are rationally justified in classing
them together – the reason is that structure.” He
also makes the point rather neatly with regard to
the standard textbook instance of a deductive
syllogism: “All men are mortal. Socrates is a
man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.” According
to Bhaskar’s causal-realist view this becomes:
“in virtue of his genetic constitution, if Socrates
is a man, he must die.” That is, we have grounds,
experiential as well as scientific, for asserting
the order of necessity here quite apart from the
syllogistic structure that identifies a well-formed
deductive inference. The same would apply to
propositions about other natural-kind terms, for
instance (to repeat) that water tends to boil when
heated, that electrical conductors are characterized
by the passage of free electrons when a current is
applied, or that the blueness of an object consists
in its reflecting light in the region of wavelength

whom realism of any variety is an option scarcely to be thought of. In these quarters it has
become an article of faith – whether derived from
Saussure, Foucault, Rorty, or Lyotard – that
“truth” is a wholly linguistic or discursive construct, and “science” just the name that attaches
to one (currently prestigious) language game or
discourse. Hence their inordinate fondness for
loose analogies with those branches of “postmodern” science that may be thought to exhibit
(in Lyotard’s parlance) a sublime disregard for
ideas and values like truth, rationality, or progress. This new kind of science, “by concerning
itself with such things as undecidables, the
limits of precise control, conflicts characterized by
incomplete information, ‘fracta,’ catastrophes,
and pragmatic paradoxes, is theorizing its own
evolution as discontinuous, catastrophic, nonrectifiable, and paradoxical.” And (Lyotard again)
since “the reserve of knowledge – language’s
reserve of possible utterances – is inexhaustible,”
therefore it is no longer a question of truth (of
that which pertains to the cognitive or constative phrase regimes), but rather a question of
the sheer “performativity,” the power of suasive
utterance, that enables scientists to pick up
research grants, plug into information networks,
and so forth. In so far as this “increases the ability to produce proof,” so likewise it “increases
the ability to be right.” Thus Lyotard comes out
pretty much in agreement with Feyerabend. In his
opinion the best (indeed the only) criterion for
scientific “progress” is that which seeks to multiply discursive differentials, to judge (so far as possible) “without criteria,” and thereby do away with
all those authoritarian constraints imposed by
notions of scientific “truth” and “method.”
With Foucault one can see yet more clearly what
results from an ultranominalist stance coupled
to a deep suspicion of science and all its works.
In The Order of Things (1973) this approach
takes the form of an “archaeological” questing
back into the various discourses, “Epistemes” or
Structures of linguistic representation that
have characterized the natural and human sciences
alike. Their history is marked – so Foucault contends – by a series of ruptures, or “epistemological breaks,” which make it strictly impossible
to compare them in point of scientific truth,
accuracy, scope, or explanatory power. The only
meaningful comparisons to be drawn are those

which operate (in Saussurian terms) on a
structural-synchronic axis, that is to say, between
the various disciplines that constitute the field
of accredited knowledge at any given time.
Foucault’s chief interest is in those ambivalent
regions of inquiry – midway between the physical and the human sciences – where issues of
truth are most deeply bound up with questions
of an ideological or Hermeneutic nature. Thus
he tends to avoid the “hard” disciplines of (for
example) physics or chemistry in favor of those
– like philology, economics, and biology – that
can plausibly be treated as interpretative constructs out of this or that dominant (periodspecific) “discourse.” So it is that Foucault’s
self-professed “archaeology of the human sciences”
can also lay claim to a generalized validity for
branches of knowledge outside and beyond what
would normally fall within that sphere.
The most famous passage from The Order of
Things is also that which most vividly displays
Foucault’s extreme anti-realist, conventionalist,
or nominalist viewpoint. It is taken from one
of Borges’s riddling parabolic fictions, and purports to reproduce a Chinese encyclopedia entry
wherein “animals” are classified as follows:
“(a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed,
(c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f ) fabulous,
(g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present
classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable,
(k) drawn with a very fine camel-hair brush, (l) et
cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher,
(n) that from a long way off look like flies.”
Foucault treats this as an object lesson in the fact
of ontological relativity, an index of the culturebound, parochial character of even our deepestlaid concepts and categories. Thus “[i]n the
wonderment of this taxonomy, the thing we
apprehend in one great leap, the thing that, by
means of the fable, is demonstrated as the exotic
charm of another system of thought, is the
limitation of our own, the stark impossibility of
thinking that.”
Three responses seem to be in order here.
First: the possibility of thinking such exotic
thoughts is demonstrated clearly enough by the
existence of Borges’s fable, Foucault’s commentary on it, and our (that is, the readers’) capacity
to perceive it as just such an instance of wild
or zany categorization. However, second: we do
so on the understanding that this is, after all, a

641
conceptual scheme. In this way he could keep
science from encroaching upon matters of religious faith. In France there is a clearly marked line
of descent which runs from Duhem, via Gaston
Bachelard, to that structuralist “revolution”
across various disciplines which achieved its
high point in the 1960s and 1970s. Structural
linguistics was at this time seen as converging with
that movement in philosophy of science, represented most notably by Bachelard, which likewise
sought to define the conditions under which a
discipline could properly assert some claim to
theoretical validity. However, this is now treated
as a bygone episode in the history of thought,
a distant prelude to the dawning awareness that
science, like philosophy, is just one “discourse”
among others, a language game with its own
favored idioms and metaphors, but without any
privilege in point of epistemological rigor or
truth. Since these include (as in Wittgenstein) the
“language game” of religious belief, it may not
be fanciful to trace the line back to Duhem’s
attempt at a negotiated truce between science
and Catholic doctrine. (Incidentally this might
also cast a revealing light on Feyerabend’s treatment of the issue between Galileo and Cardinal
Bellarmine.)
If Bachelard is remembered nowadays, it is
chiefly for works like The Psychoanalysis of Fire
(1964), his essays in reflection on those modes
of metaphoric or creative reverie that stand, so to
speak, at the opposite pole from the scientific language of concept and rational inference. What is
thereby forgotten – one might say repressed – is
the fact that these writings were themselves a
part of his epistemological project, his attempt to
distinguish more clearly between the two realms
of thought. It is a plain misreading of Bachelard’s
work to extract from it the modish doctrine that
“all truth claims are fictions,” “all concepts just
sublimated metaphors,” or “ ‘science’ merely the
name we attach to some currently prestigious
language game.” On the contrary: Bachelard’s
aim was to prevent such promiscuous leveling of
the difference – the more than contingent, linguistic, or localized (culture-specific) difference
– between scientific epistemologies on the one
hand and poetic-metaphorical “reverie” on the
other. Thus what Bachelard meant by his term
“epistemological break” was a decisive rupture with
prescientific modes of thought, one that marked

science, philosophy of

piece of fabulous contrivance, a fiction invented
by Borges (and cited by Foucault) with the purpose
of offering an “exotic” slant on our naturalized
habits of thought and perception. In that case
(third) it is an error – a confusion everywhere
manifest in The Order of Things – to argue from
the mere possibility of thinking such starkly
“impossible” thoughts (whatever this might
mean) to the idea that all our concepts, categories,
ontological commitments, and so forth are likewise fictive constructions out of one such “arbitrary” discourse or another. Nevertheless, this is
exactly the premise that underwrites Foucault’s
entire project, from his early structuralistinspired “archaeology” of knowledge to the
Nietzschean-genealogical approach that characterized his post-1970 works. It is perhaps best seen
as a reductio ad absurdum of that anti-realist line
of argument which begins by locating truth in
propositions about things, rather than in the
things themselves, and which ends – as with
Quine, Kuhn, Rorty, Lyotard, et al. – by holistically relativizing “truth” to whatever sorts of
language game happen to enjoy that title. In
other words, it presses right through with that
rejection of de re in favor of de dicto necessity which
then turns out to undermine the very grounds of
science as a truth-seeking enterprise. This irony
indeed finds pointed expression in the title of
Foucault’s book. For on his account there cannot exist any “things” – any extra-discursive
objects, entities, kinds or categories of thing –
whose various “orderings” by language or discourse would render his thesis intelligible.
It is worth noting that there may be a common
source for some of these issues that have recently
emerged in both French and Anglo-American
philosophy of science. It is to be found in the work
of Pierre Duhem (1861–1916), a thinker whom
Quine has acknowledged as a major influence,
and whose name is standardly coupled with his
own in discussions of the Duhem–Quine thesis
with regard to ontological relativity. Duhem, it is
worth recalling, was a physicist who specialized
in thermodynamics, as well as a philosopherhistorian of science, and a practicing Catholic.
Hence his belief that science was not in the
business of providing ultimate explanations,
but should rather confine itself to a conventionalist account of those truths that held good
with respect to some given (ontology-relative)

science, philosophy of

642
the crucial stage of advance to an adequate conceptualization of some given domain. It retains
this significance, if more problematically, in
Louis Althusser’s structural-Marxist account
of the science/Ideology distinction. However,
for Foucault the idea of an “epistemological
break” has been relativized to the point where
it means nothing more than a random shift in
the prevailing (discursively produced) “order of
things.”
That Saussure should nowadays be routinely
coopted by adepts of this ultrarelativist view is,
to say the least, something of an irony, given his
methodological concerns and his desire to set
linguistics on the path toward a genuine (structural-synchronic) science of language. Such was
indeed the main source of its appeal for that earlier generation of theorists who saw in it, as likewise in Bachelard’s work, a means of articulating
the difference between Metaphor and concept,
ideology and science, natural (everyday) language on the one hand and theoretical discourse
on the other. In both cases, however, Saussure and
Bachelard, these claims were lost from view with
the postmodern turn toward an out-and-out
conventionalist theory of science, knowledge,
and representation which treated such ideas as
merely a species of “metalinguistic” delusion. Thus
Bachelard was read – or standardly invoked – as
arguing that all scientific concepts could in the
end be traced back to their subliminal source
in some privileged metaphor or image cluster.
Saussure’s theoretical commitments counted for
nothing in comparison with the prospects that
were opened up by treating all theories (his own
presumably among them) as “constructed in” or
“relative to” some localized Signifying practice.
It could then be maintained, without fear of contradiction on reasoned philosophical grounds,
that literary critics were among the vanguard
party in a coming “revolution” of the instituted
order of discourse, an event whose signs they
were able to read from their knowledge that
“reality” was merely the figment of a naturalized
(though in fact merely “arbitrary”) relation
between signifier and signified.
The problems with this doctrine are those that
have bedeviled every version of the relativist
argument from Protagoras down. That is to say,
if we redefine “true” as “true relative to L”

(where L is taken to denote some language,
paradigm, conceptual scheme, “Interpretative
community,” or whatever), then there is no way
of counting any belief false just so long as it can
claim – or could once claim – some measure
of communal assent. From this it follows ex
hypothese that all beliefs are true by their own cultural lights, or according to their own immanent
criteria as manifest in this or that linguistically
mediated “form of life.” Every single truth claim
that was ever entertained by a community of
like-minded knowers must count as valid when
referred to the language game, vocabulary, or
belief system then in place. Thus for instance it
was once true – not just an artifact of limited
knowledge or erroneous “commonsense” perception – that the fixed planets were seven in
number; that the sun rotated about the earth; that
combustion entailed the release of a colourless,
odourless, intangible substance called phlogiston,
rather than the uptake of oxygen; and that no
fixed-wing aircraft could possibly get off the
ground since the necessary lift could be generated
only by a bird-like flapping motion, or perhaps
– as Leonardo da Vinci was the first to suggest –
a rotary-blade arrangement of the helicopter
type. In each case and numerous others besides
(one could multiply examples at leisure), the
belief in question is no less true, or no more
demonstrably false, than those other beliefs that
are nowdays widely (even universally) taken for
matters of scientific fact. What counts is their suasive efficacy as measured by the current norms
of “science” as a going enterprise, a rhetorical
activity where truth is defined in performative
(not constative) terms, and where any distinction
between concept and metaphor turns out to be
merely – like the word “concept” itself, not to
mention the concept of “metaphor” – a species
of repressed or sublimated metaphor. Therefore
it follows, supposedly, that all truth talk, whether
in the natural or the more theory-prone human
sciences, comes down to a choice of the right sort
of metaphor (or the optimum rhetorical strategy)
for conjuring assent from others engaged in the
same communal enterprise.
Scientists (and at least some philosophers of
science) have understandably considered this
an implausible account of how advances come
about through the joint application of theory and

`Screen 
The most important journal of film
criticism in English. Founded in 1969, it has
a rich history filled with shifts of focus, editorial
control, and ownership. Its history begins almost
two decades before the inaugural issue, when in
1950 the British film institute (BFI) founded
the Society for Education in Film and Television
(SEFT), a grant-in-aid body which later parented
Screen. SEFT established several initial publications
out of which grew the journal Screen Education,
founded in 1959 as a source of articles on film
education, film theory, and the film industry.
Ten years later, SEFT reestablished the journal
under a new title, Screen. With its new name came
a change of focus; no longer singly dedicated to
articles on education, the journal confronted controversial issues in television and Film studies.

Screen

empirical research. Hence, as I have argued,
the recent emergence of anti-conventionalist or
causal-realist approaches which offer a far better
understanding of our knowledge of the growth of
knowledge. After all, there seems rather little to
be said for a philosophy of science that effectively
leaves itself nothing to explain by reducing
“science” to just another species of preferential
language game, rhetoric, discourse, conceptual
scheme, or whatever. The current revival of realist
ontologies (along with the return to “natural-kind”
theories of reference) betokens a break with this
whole misdirected – as it now appears – line of
thought. In a longer purview it simply takes up
the position attributed to Aristotle by his commentator Themistius: namely, the principle that
“that which exists does not conform to various
opinions, but rather the correct opinions conform
to that which exists.”

At first, Screen included a separate section
entitled “Educational Notes,” but after just three
issues, SEFT established Screen Education Notes,
a separate publication that became Screen
Education in 1974.
For eight years, SEFT supported both journals: Screen for its work in film theory, and
Screen Education for its articles on teaching film.
During this time, Screen focused on the relationship between Semiology, Marxism, and Psychoanalysis, and despite forging a reputation
as a leading critical journal – compared by some
to Cahiers du Cinéma – the editorial board
split over the journal’s shifting focus. Four board
members – Edward Buscombe, Christine
Gledhill, Alan Lovell, and Christopher Williams
– voiced their objections in a 1976 article entitled
“Psychoanalysis and film”; the article was ostensibly about Screen’s treatment of psychoanalysis,
but their concerns – among them that “controversial intellectual choices [were] made to
appear unproblematic” and that the writing was
“full of ambiguities and uncertainties” – were
much deeper. The four resigned in 1976. Writing
for American Film years later, Colin MacCabe,
a board member from 1973 to 1981, supported
their criticisms and, though he suggested that in
their final years of that decade changes to Screen
reflected some of their criticisms, MacCabe
admits that during these years he too grew disillusioned with the journal.
In the early 1980s Screen entered another
phase. Faced with limited funds, SEFT incorporated Screen Education back into Screen. The
Screen of this decade was no more immune to
criticism than it had been in 1976. Michael
Pursell, writing for Literature/Film Quarterly in
1986, coined the term “Screenspeak” to describe
the journal’s style, accusing Screen of knowingly
excluding, by wanton use of technical vocabulary
and a blindness to alternative interpretations, the
people for whom it claimed to write.
The most recent change to Screen came in
1990, when the BFI dissolved SEFT; the journal’s
ownership and editorial offices now moved to
the John Logie Baird Centre at the University of
Glasgow, and the Oxford University Press began
publishing the quarterly journal. The journal
now includes several new sections, “Reports and
debates” and “Reviews,” and assumes a more
academic tone, reflecting the editors’ desires

to “redefine ‘the academic’” and “to attempt to
re-establish the usefulness of academic, even
scholarly work,” aims which they announced in
their Spring 1990 editorial.

`Scrutiny 
Challenging a strict academic response to literature and intent upon developing
an understanding of the movements of British
civilization in their day, a group of young
Cambridge research assistants founded Scrutiny
in 1932. Despite their own connection with the
academic setting, the journal’s founders identified a need for a publication free from the
confines of the academy, which could promote
the exchange of ideas crucial to a comprehension
of British Culture – literary and non-literary.
Their interests were overwhelmingly British and
they saw their project as a British counterpart to
the American New Republic. Their approach was
radical; literature represented to them a means of
preserving the British cultural and moral society.
With the publication of criticism, they hoped to
present a legitimate analysis of both the practical
and the political influences of literature and to
present their cause to the “public of Common
Readers,” as they wrote in their manifesto. They
believed that a select group of academics – “selfappointed sponsors of society” were their words
– drowned out the voices of the public, their
intended audience, and in their first publication
invited readers to respond. Critics of the journal,
however, claim that the editors of Scrutiny never
escaped elitism and, in fact, assumed a literary
background equal to their own.
For its 21 years of publication, Scrutiny
contained critical articles on literature, art, and
contemporary life; book reviews, and, whenever
possible, original composition. The quarterly
journal had no financial sponsor and depended
on subscriptions and limited advertising revenue,
and could provide no payment to contributors.
In October 1953 the last issue of Scrutiny was
published, a decision which F.R. Leavis, one of
the founding editors, describes as having been
“narrowly evaded” several times in the preceding

`Scruton, Roger (1944–) 
Professor of
Aesthetics and philosopher, associated with
the conservative wing of the British New right
as editor of The Salisbury Review and prolific
author of works of “dogmatics,” cultural criticism,
and journalism. Scruton’s conservatism – arising
from a sense of belonging “to some continuing
and pre-existing social order” and the realization
that this is “all-important” in determining what
to do – originally found its “principal enemy”
in Liberalism. His Hegelian defense of the
authority of the state and the institutions which
nourish it was thus fashioned in opposition to
doctrines of individual autonomy, natural rights,
the “obsession” with freedom, the market, the “rot
of pluralism,” and the claims of democracy.
Latterly he suggested a reconciliation of social conservatism and economic liberalism in the light of
Hayek’s social epistemology and the experience
of post-Communist Central Europe.

`semiotics (semiology) 
The science of Signs.
Although the term “semiology,” which was
coined by Saussure (1915, p. 16), has been
commonly used in Europe, “semiotics” is now
in general use on both sides of the Atlantic.
Semiotics originated in ancient attempts by
Hippocrates and Galen to understand the relationships between the body and the mind and to
relate symptoms to diseases. Nothing less than the
links between Body, mind, and Culture – as these
constitute themselves as Signs – determine the
field of semiotics (Danesi, 1994, pp. xi–xii). This
does not mean, however, that semiotics is about
everything. Umberto Eco (1967, p. 7) has wittily
defined semiotics as the study of everything that
can be taken as a sign. “A sign is everything which
can be taken as significantly substituting for something else. This something else does not necessarily
have to exist or to actually be somewhere at the
moment when a sign stands in for it. Thus semiotics is in principle the discipline studying everything
which can be used in order to lie. If something cannot be used to tell a lie, conversely it cannot be
used to tell the truth: it cannot in fact be used to
tell at all. I think that the definition of a theory
of the lie should be taken as a fairly comprehensive program for a general semiotics.” Eco then
proceeds to map the field of semiotics as consisting
of 19 areas of contemporary research, ranging from
spontaneous natural processes of communication to complex cultural systems: zoosemiotics;
olfactory signs; tactile communication; Codes of
taste; paralinguistics; medical semiotics; kinesics
and proxemics; musical codes; formalized languages; written languages; unknown alphabets;
secret codes; natural languages; visual communication; systems of objects; plot structure; Text
theory; cultural codes; aesthetic texts; mass communication; and rhetoric. Although Barthes
(1964, p. 11) attempted to invert Saussure’s
declaration and to absorb semiology into a

commit the speaker to do something); expressives
(which reveal the psychological state of the

`Shklovsky, Viktor (1893–1984) 
Russian
Soviet writer, critic, and literary theorist, one of
the founding members of OPOYAZ (the Society
for Studies of Poetic Language) and the leading representative of Russian formalism.
Shklovsky’s career began in the first decade of
the twentieth century when he published such
early theoretical works as The Resurrection of the
Word, based on artistic practices of Russian
futurists (V. Khlebnikov, V. Mayakovsky, and
A. Kruchenykh), who declared language rather
than reality the true material of their works. It is
not surprising, therefore, that Shklovsky’s works
of that period are focused on the discussion of the

“self-sufficient word,” the stylistic innovations, and
poetic specificity of Russian futurists. In 1916
Shklovsky became a cofounder of OPOYAZ and
thus one of the leaders of the “formal school” in
Literary criticism.
Shklovsky was among the first literary critics
who viewed verbal art primarily as a construction,
establishing the laws of plot development and considering these laws as the sum total of devices by
means of which the work of art is constructed.
The analysis of these devices, the principles of connections between images, of the “resurrection of
the word” renewed by construction becomes the
center of Shklovsky’s attention in such articles
as “About poetry and beyonsense language” and
“Potebnya,” both 1916. From 1919 Shklovsky
dedicated his efforts to the development of the
theory of prose. The topics of his investigations
range from the analysis of elements and laws of
plot development in individual works of literature
(“How Don Quixote is made” and “Parodic
novel. Sterne’s Tristam Shandy”) to the discussion of literary genres (“Mystery novella” and
“Mystery novel”) and trends in literature
(“Ornamental prose” dedicated to the analysis
of works of a symbolist poet and writer Andrey
Bely), culminating in theoretical works such as
“Art as device” and “The connection between
devices of plot construction and general stylistic
devices,” which became cornerstones for the formalist movement. All these essays were collected
in a book On the Theory of Prose (1925), which
is often considered Shklovsky’s most important
work. Shklovsky maintained that art represented
reality not through content but through form. The
form is the sum total of devices such as retardation, parallelism, contrast, etc. One of the most
interesting discoveries Shklovsky made in the area
of the analysis of literary devices was the theory
of “estrangement.” According to Shklovsky, the
word in a literary work is freed from customary,
petrified, fixed combinations; and it reveals its
inner form that allows for the restoration of the
word’s primary expressive meaning. Thus the
word in art represents the world as if seen anew,
as if it is born for the very first time.
In addition to his contribution to literary
theory, Shklovsky was also a pioneer of Russian
cinema as a critic and script writer (he wrote
the scripts for Lev Kuleshov’s By the Law, Third

`Showalter, Elaine (1941–) 
US feminist
literary critic. Elaine Showalter has been a major
proponent of American Feminist criticism.
She coined the term Gynocritics and penned
several of the most important statements of gynocritical theory and method; not surprisingly,
her numerous studies of British and US women
writers’ literary history rank among the fullest
realizations of gynocritical ideals. In A Literature of Their Own (1977), Showalter provides a
framework for understanding British women’s
literary history, dividing it into three stages,
each subject to what Frederick Jameson would
call a “cultural dominant”: Feminine before
1880, Feminist between 1880 and 1920, and
Female since 1920. The difference between A
Literature of Their Own and Showalter’s later
history of US women writers, Sister’s Choice
(1991), reveals the flexibility of gynocritics,
and especially its remarkable response to early
criticism that it was racist. While Showalter’s
first book focused exclusively on Gender without considering the issues of Race and nationality that would become so important by the late
1980s, the introduction to Sister’s Choice draws
heavily on Afro-American literary theory, particularly notions of the essential hybridity and
double-voicedness of literary Texts, and subsequent chapters attempt a racially desegregated
US women’s literary history. Showalter’s essay,
“A criticism of their own,” discusses the similar
trajectories of Afro-American and feminist
criticisms, as well as potential bases for alliance
and solidarity. Here, as in earlier essays, some
of which are collected in her edited anthology,
The New Feminist Criticism (1985), Showalter’s
histories of critical movements are provocative
and useful. Showalter has consistently defended
feminist pluralism and argued that feminist
Discourse must necessarily remain heterogeneous. She deals with her detractors graciously and
even-handedly, as when she includes Barbara
Smith’s critique of Racism in her work in The New
Feminist Criticism and alters her own critical
practice in response. Her witty essay, “Critical
cross-dressing: male feminists and the woman
of the year” (1983), deserves special notice as
an intervention in the debate about men in
feminism.

Meshchanskaya Street, and Captain’s Daughter). In
Literature and Cinematography (1923), Shklovsky
provided an early theoretical foundation for cinematic art as distinguished from theater. He also
supplied the first substantial analysis of the early
works of Sergey Eisenstein, based on the principle of montage of attractions.
Shklovsky was an original and prolific prose
writer as well. His novels, Sentimental Journey
(1923), Zoo: Letters not about Love, or The
Third Eloise (1923), and Hamburg Count (1928),
although based on autobiographical principles,
bear an unmistakable resemblance to his theoretical works: short aphoristic phrases connected by
associations, which are often hidden so that the
reader must discover them in order to grasp the
meaning. The associative nature of Shklovsky’s
fragmentary narrative is based on a wealth of
historical knowledge which cements the text and
does not allow it to fall apart. Shklovsky uses
quotations extensively, documents that become a
kind of a montage of facts, creating a mosaic of
a given historical period in his novels.
In the 1930s formalism came under attack
from the official socialist realist critics. Shklovsky
was forced publicly to denounce his position
(“The Monument to the Scientific Mistake,” 1930)
and to start writing socially useful works about
such official Soviet writers as M. Sholokhov,
N. Ostrovsky, M. Gorky, investigating the correspondence between the social and ideological
milieu and the literary work created within its surroundings. Only in the 1970s was Shklovsky able
to return to his early ideas of literary genre, in
a book called The Bow-String: On Incompatibility
of the Compatible.

`sign
 Something that stands for something else
(aliquid stat pro aliquo) the relation between
something and something else, or the perception
(or misperception) of a relation between something and something else. In the first of these
definitions the sign stands for something that is
absent, past, or yet to come (such as the portents
of a storm or a disaster). In the second definition, the sign and what it signifies form at one
extreme a dyadic relationship (as in Linnaeus’s
attempt to give a different name to each distinct
object in nature) or at the other extreme,
according to Saussure, a purely arbitrary relationship. The third definition assumes a triad of
sign, signified, and perceiver, as in Augustine’s
famous formulation in De Doctrina Christiana.
A sign is a thing which causes us to think of
something beyond the impression the thing itself
makes upon the senses (see Jackson, 1972). The
American philosopher C.S. Peirce brilliantly
elaborates on this definition in “Some consequences of four incapacities,” arguing that
ultimately all thoughts are signs.
Although the sign is basic to all theories of
language, especially to the science of Semiotics,
it is a notoriously unstable term and concept.
Usually assumed to be an element of visual communication, the word “sign” for Saussure refers
strictly to an image acoustique, which is at least
an oxymoron or at best a synesthesiac term that
baffles even Saussure’s most careful commentators (Harris, pp. 58–9). Such fascinating oddities
as this in Saussure’s Course in General Linguistics
have led Derrida to detect a phonocentric
prejudice in Saussure by which he disparages
Writing as a monstrous intrusion on spoken language. Before Derrida went to work on Saussure

and the sign, Jacques Lacan had appropriated both
for psychoanalytic theory, and the Danish linguist
Louis Hjelmslev had begun to expand on
Saussure’s conviction that language is a System
or Structure of forms, not substances, by
arguing that linguistic units are neither sounds nor
meanings, but rather their interplay or relation.
For Lacan signs do not come singly but in
signifying chains. Furthermore he proposed, in
an apparent reversal of Saussure, that it is the
signifier itself that generates the signified.
Returning, in the wake of Lacan and
Hjelmslev, to Saussure’s theory of the sign,
Derrida found a fundamental inconsistency
between the arbitrariness of the sign and the presumed secondary, dependent, or monstrous role
of writing in relation to speech. Derrida’s proposal
for a science of writing – Grammatology – and
his argument that the sign itself, like all human
structures, is subject to Deconstruction in
order to reveal previously disguised or ignored
assumptions, constitute one of the most powerful critiques of the sign as a supposedly stable,
elemental unit of language.

`Signs 
Established in 1975 by Catherine
Stimpson and a group of feminist scholars from
Barnard College, Signs has since its inception
been an interdisciplinary journal intended to
provide a forum for new scholarship about
women. Originally designed to challenge mainstream scholarship, it has, in the course of 20 years
of publication, provided the context for social
and historical change, and in doing so has itself
become a mainstream journal. Its very structure
has allowed for this shift; over the years, its
editors have remained sensitive to the continually changing field of feminist research, and have
solicited scholarship from important thinkers
whose work is at the edge of historical and cultural change. Signs devotes each of its quarterly
issues to a specific field: the social sciences, the
humanities, the natural sciences, or work and
professions. Initially, only the first and fourth
issues in each yearly volume were to focus on general themes, but since then the editors of Signs have
presented themes in the other two issues as well.
The first theme issue addressed the concept of
“power,” but a later issue focused on the interdisciplinary nature of computers.

In their manifesto, the first editors of Signs conceived of the journal as a “process over time”;
perhaps their most effective tool for ensuring that
their journal remained responsive to changing
modes of feminist scholarship was their establishment of a rotating editorial board. With the first
rotation – each editorial term lasts five years – the
Signs editorial offices moved in 1980 to Stanford,
where Barbara Charlesworth Gelpi of the English
department, and six of her colleagues, channeled
the already prospering journal into new areas
of research, to continue what Stimpson and her
team, in their final editorial, presented as a
change in new scholarship about women. Still
understanding the journal as a “process,” the new
editorial board’s aim was to recognize the multiplicity of feminisms and to continue to promote
feminist scholarship as a vital bridge between
academic disciplines and social realities.
With the editorial rotation in 1985, Signs
moved into the hands of Jean O’Barr, a political
scientist at Duke University. She and her colleagues
at Duke and the University of North Carolina’s
Women’s Studies Research Center, of which
she was also the director, explored a new set of
feminist themes. O’Barr, responsible for the
issue on computers, further developed the interdisciplinary nature of feminist studies. In 1990 the
current editors – for the first time from different
disciplines – took over Signs. Operating out of
the Center for Advanced Feminist Studies at the
University of Minnesota, Ruth-Ellen Boetcher
Joeres, a historical sociologist, and Barbara Laslett,
a scholar of German literature, introduced a
new feature to the journal. This section, called
“Forum,” is devoted to academic Discourse
and is intended to reflect what Joeres and Laslett
identify as a “multivocality” in feminist issues.
Eager to see a renewal of the energy which
sparked the inception of Signs, the two promise
to transform the diverse field of feminist
scholarship, always aware of its critical balance
between providing an alternative to mainstream
scholarship and becoming a part of it.

`skin 
The largest organ and outermost covering
of the human Body. Skin functions both as a
protective shield around the body’s inner layers
and as a permeable border that distinguishes the

skin

connotative, context-bound significance of words,
which is accessible only to those who share the
unique cultural values of a given black speech community. The term “signifying” itself currently
carries a range of metaphorical and theoretical
meanings in black cultural studies that stretch far
beyond its literal scope of reference. In his highly
influential book, The Signifying Monkey (1988),
Henry Louis Gates, Jr, expands the term to refer
not merely to a specific vernacular strategy but
also to a Trope of double-voiced repetition and
reversal that exemplifies the distinguishing property of black Discourse. Thus redefined, the
trope of signifying authorizes Gates’s ambitious
construction of a theory of black literary intertextuality grounded in the vernacular tradition.

body from its environment. As the connective
tissue between the inner and outer “self,” skin
problematizes the Binary oppositions between
surface and depth, interiority and exteriority,
visibility and invisibility. It is a multisensory
organ, one that complicates above all the perceptions of touch, sight, and sound.
Although the terrain of medics and physiologists,
skin is not only an object of scientific investigation, but also the subject of increasing scholarly
debate in the fields of cultural and Critical
theory. Like the human body, the human skin
also has an elaborate history. Recent pioneering
studies on this topic include Claudia Benthien’s
Skin: On the Cultural Border between the Self and
the World (2002) and Steven Connor’s The Book
of Skin (2004). Both works adopt an interdisciplinary and Cultural studies approach,
drawing on a wide range of examples in language, literature, philosophy, Art, and science
in order to shed light on the historically shifting
perceptions of skin throughout Western culture.
Benthien argues that despite medicine having
exposed the permeability of the epidermis and thus
the interior of the body, skin has paradoxically
become an increasingly rigid boundary. Connor
expands his analysis to encompass current preoccupations with the epidermis, from cosmetics
and plastic surgery, to children’s love of scabs and
fascination with sticking-plaster.
Skin is indeed omnipresent, not only on our
bodies but also in our speech, as demonstrated
by the number of colloquial skin expressions in
English alone: “beauty is only skin deep”; “by
the skin of one’s teeth”; “to be skin and bone”;
“to be thick- or thin-skinned”; “to change one’s
skin”; “to get under one’s skin”; “to have one’s
hide”; “to jump out of one’s skin”; “the naked
truth”; “to save one’s skin”; “no skin off one’s
nose”; “[soaked] to the skin”; “with a whole skin.”
Yet despite its profound associations with language,
literature, history, and science, skin is necessarily related to the visual by virtue of its visibility.
As a bodily surface, skin can take on the metaphor of a pictorial surface or support used in
artistic representation. Likewise, a surface such as
a canvas can also take on the metaphor of a skin.
Although artworks themselves have long since
made this association between actual skin, visual
representation, and material support, only in the
eighteenth century was the skin/canvas metaphor
first noted in written form. Ultimately, what

remains at stake in any discussion of skin is the
distinction, or rather slippage, between literal,
represented, and metaphorical “skin.”
Since antiquity, skin has occupied a prominent
position in the visual arts. The practice of tattooing
is one of the oldest and most universal art forms,
dating from the late fourth millennium bc in
Europe and from around 2000 bc in Egypt.
Tattooing at once makes of the skin a medium
and collapses the skin/canvas metaphor: skin
literally is the surface of the pictorial design. The
tattoo further complicates the above-mentioned
relationships between surface and depth, interiority and exteriority, visibility and invisibility, as
the pigment is injected beneath the skin’s surface
yet is visible on the skin’s surface. In her essay “The
Renaissance tattoo” Juliet Fleming refers to the
work of Julia Kristeva, declaring that the tattoo,
lodged on the border between inside and outside,
occupies the no-place of abjection (Fleming
in Caplan, 2000, p. 64). Moreover, given the
particular social codes that it carries and its
wider cultural function as a signifier of difference,
the tattoo also problematizes the relationship
between inclusion and exclusion:
[It] has been taken to mark off entire “civilizations” from their “barbarian” or “savage”
neighbours; to declare a convict’s criminality,
whether by branding him as a punishment or
because he has inverted this penal practice by
acquiring voluntary tattoos (thereby, ironically, marking himself ); and more generally to
inscribe various kinds of group membership,
often in opposition to a dominant culture.
(Caplan, 2000, p. xiv)

Unlike scars, which heal over time or with the aid
of plastic surgery, tattoos were until recently
permanent and irreversible.
The design of not only image tattoos but also
Text tattoos transforms the skin into a book,
a contained surface that can literally be inscribed
and read. Furthermore, tattoos are by definition
fixed images on mobile bodies – and thus represent some of the earliest portable yet inevitably
ephemeral artworks – whose form changes over
time as a result of the skin aging, and whose
meaning changes in space as the body moves
location.
While the long-established, widespread practice
of tattooing calls for the unbroken skin as its

651
knife in one hand and a hide in the other as
evidence of his martyrdom. What makes this
portrayal both distinct and problematic, however,
is that Michelangelo has inserted a self-portrait
onto the flayed skin of Bartholomew, thus
explicitly identifying himself as the flayed victim.
The figure of Bartholomew sits rather uneasily
within modern discourses on the epidermis as
a site of identity – a marker of characteristics such
as age, race, and social status (Benthien, 2002,
p. viii) – for it is precisely by removing his skin
that he gains his identity as a martyr. In short,
he is “made” by being “unmade.” Moreover,
portrayals of the martyrdom of Bartholomew
in medieval manuscript illumination narrow the
gap between literal, represented, and metaphorical “skin.” Given that the parchment pages
themselves are made from animal hide, they
call attention to the materiality of flaying by
representing the removal of skin on the support
of actual flayed skin, which is itself frequently torn
or damaged (Kay, 2006).
Like the myth of Marsyas and the martyrdom
of Bartholomew, the Persian legend of Sisamnes,
first recorded by Herodotus in his Historiae,
chronicles how the corrupt judge was skinned alive
by King Cambyses as punishment for misconduct.
Gerard David’s famous diptych The Judgment
of Cambyses (1498) represents four distinct
episodes from the story: on the left panel in the
background, Sisamnes is depicted receiving a
bribe, while in the foreground he is taken under
arrest; on the right panel, the gruesome flaying
occupies the entire foreground space, while a
background detail reveals the judge’s successor –
his son Otanes – seated on the throne of judgment to which is fastened the skin of Sisamnes,
which functions both as a reminder of his father’s
corruption and as an admonition to maintain
integrity. It is noteworthy that an anonymous
sixteenth-century Netherlandish artist directly
modeled his painting of The Martyrdom of Saint
Bartholomew on the right panel of David’s
diptych. This visual quotation not only unites
the flayed transgressors of judge and saint, but
also sets off the “victim-identified” story of
Bartholomew with the “spectator-identified”
morals that led to Sisamnes’s punishment (Mills,
2005, p. 82). Equally noteworthy is the compositional parallel between the flaying of Sisamnes
and the representation of anatomical dissections.
This is underscored by the splayed body of the

skin

medium, in early modern Europe some of the
most extensive commentaries on the epidermis
outside of the medical field concern its removal
from the body. Three figures in particular are
renowned for having been flayed alive in both
legend and art: the satyr Marsyas, the apostle
Bartholomew, and the judge Sisamnes. In the
ancient Greek myth, Marsyas, half-man, halfgoat, challenges Apollo, god of the muses, to a
musical contest. Marsyas competes with a doublereed instrument known as the “aulos,” Apollo
with the seven-stringed lyre. After Marsyas’s
inevitable defeat, Apollo punishes the satyr for his
sin of “hubris” or extreme pride by tying him to
a tree and flaying him alive. This subject was
frequently depicted by Renaissance and Baroque
artists, who turned to Ovid’s Metamorphoses in
which Marsyas, described as “all one wound,” cries,
“Why do you tear me from myself?” In this
instance, the skin and the “self ” are perceived
as inseparable. Elaine Scarry’s seminal book
The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking
of the World (1985) provides a springboard for
conceptualizing the significance of skin as a
site of both “making” and “unmaking.” While
Apollo “unmakes” the satyr’s body, he simultaneously “makes” Marsyas scream. Titian’s celebrated picture The Flaying of Marsyas (c.1570–6)
is one of the most striking interpretations of
the subject. The painting represents the satyr
suspended upside down from a tree in the
middle of the composition; Apollo, his knife
poised to Marsyas’s chest, peels back a flap of skin
from which drips a pool of blood, lapped up
by a dog in the foreground. In this work, Titian
exploits his oil painting technique in order to
create a play on bodily and pictorial surfaces: the
layers of pigment that form the body of the satyr
suggest “paint as skin and skin as paint” (Bohde,
2003, p. 37).
Marsyas is universally recognized as the pagan
counterpart to the apostle Bartholomew, who also
suffered the same fate. As recounted in Jacobus
de Voragine’s Golden Legend, Bartholomew was
captured by King Astyages of Armenia for having
converted the latter’s brother to the Christian
faith. After the apostle refused to worship the king’s
god and smashed his idol to pieces, Astyages
ordered Bartholomew to be flayed alive. Michelangelo’s Last Judgment fresco in the Sistine
Chapel (1534–41) represents one of the best
known depictions of Bartholomew, bearing a

judge on the table and the painstaking precision
with which the executioners carry out their task.
Although they are potentially at odds with
each other, David likens the corrupted body
of Sisamnes (opened as a form of punishment)
to the dissected cadaver (opened in search of
knowledge), as the still living body of Sisamnes
is literally stripped of its political skin and
reduced to the state of a corpse.
This complex relationship between art and
science, flaying and dissection, is further heightened in the work of the contemporary French performance artist Orlan. Infamous for her surgical
performances entitled The Reincarnation of Saint
Orlan (1990–5), the artist undergoes a series of
nine plastic surgeries in which she attempts to
reshape her face according to the male ideal of
female beauty found in Italian Renaissance and
nineteenth-century French art. Selecting five
specific works whose subjects have inspired her
own artistic practice, Orlan identifies certain
physical attributes that she then endeavors to
morph onto her own face: the chin of Venus in
Sandro Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus (c.1480);
the nose of Psyche in François Pascal Simon
Gérard’s Le Premier baisser de l’amour à Psyche
(c.1820); the eyes of Diana in the anonymous
school-of-Fontainebleau sculpture Diane chasseresse; the lips of Europa in Gustave Moreau’s
L’enlévement d’Europe (c.1876); and the brow of
Leonardo’s Mona Lisa (c.1503–5). From its very
inception, however, The Reincarnation of Saint
Orlan was designed as a paradox: although she
draws on specific artworks, Orlan consciously fails
to appropriate clearly recognizable features of
these five female figures (O’Bryan, 2005, p. xii).
She explains that she is referencing them not
literally, but instead symbolically, “not for the
canons of beauty they are supposed to represent,
but for their histories.” In her statement defining
her surgical performances as “carnal art,” Orlan
maintains that her work focuses not on the
product, but on the process of plastic surgery,
on “the spectacle and discourse of the modified
body which has become the place of public
debate.” Indeed, this conception is reinforced
by her elaborate documentation of the performances through the media of Photography
and film, where she emphasizes the grotesque
“during” instead of the beauty “after,” the flayed
as opposed to the flawless skin. In this instance,

rather than functioning as the location of a fixed
state or identity, skin becomes the site of a
graphic metamorphosis, the place of continuous
“making,” “unmaking,” and “remaking.”
Given the problems of subjectivity and narcissism that permeate Orlan’s work, the connection between skin and Psychoanalysis merits
consideration. Didier Anzieu’s The Skin Ego: A
Psychoanalytic Approach to the Self (1989) represents a ground-breaking study of the often troubling rapport between mind and skin. Anzieu
defines the skin ego “as a containing, unifying
envelope for the Self; as a protective barrier for
the psyche; and as a filter of exchanges and a
surface of inscription for the first traces, a function
which makes representation possible” (Anzieu,
1989, p. 98). In the chapter entitled “The Envelope
of Suffering,” Anzieu describes the painful treatment administered to victims of third-degree
burns. One procedure involves immersing the
naked victim into a heavily chlorinated bath in
order to disinfect the wound. The treatment is
unpleasant both for the patient and for the attendant, who must tear off damaged shreds of skin
from the victim’s body to allow it to regenerate
completely. Although this procedure is executed
with the intention of healing the patient, the
attendant unwittingly re-enacts the punishment
of Marsyas (Anzieu, 1989, p. 202). In one case
study, an injured adolescent girl was being given
a bath when suddenly she cried out to a clinical
psychologist in the room, “Can’t you see I’m in
pain! Say something, anything, but talk . . . talk!”
When the two began to speak, their exchange
created a metaphorical “skin of words” that
soothed the victim and enabled the bath to proceed with minimal pain. According to Anzieu, “the
skin of words that is woven between the burns
victim and an understanding interlocutor may
re-establish symbolically a containing psychical
skin that is able to make more bearable the pain
caused by a wound to the real skin” (Anzieu, 1989,
pp. 204–5). Whereas in the Marsyas myth the
sound of the satyr’s screams signifies the violent
destruction of the skin, in the burns unit the
sound of the spoken word functions as a blanket,
a metaphorical second skin that psychically protects the body from further physical harm.
Skin continues to prompt new questions and
to provoke further scholarly debate. In addition

`social formation 
This term is used by most
theorists (including Marx and Engels) to designate a certain type of society such as feudal
or bourgeois. It is given a more specific import
in the tradition of structuralist Marxist theorists, which includes Maurice Godelier, Louis
Althusser, Barry Hindess, and Paul Hirst. As
opposed to the humanist readings of Marx
offered by Lukács, Gramsci, and others, which
stress the role of human agency and history in
social development, the structuralist Marxists
have contended that what Marx primarily points
the way to is a “scientific” structural analysis of
social formations. Althusser views Marxism as
a new science of the history of social formations.
These are not centered on human agencies;
rather, they comprise a structure of hierarchies
relatively autonomous but determined “in the

last instance” by the economic substructure.
Some of these theorists have attempted to distinguish between the usage of “social formation”
and “society”; however, Althusser’s understanding of “social formation” as the total complex
of superstructure and economic infrastructure
contains perhaps the most potential for the practical application of this term.

`socialist realism 
This aesthetic achieved
predominance in Russia from around 1930 to
1956. Both prior to and beyond the Bolshevik
revolution of 1917, Russia witnessed a series
of heated debates, between Lenin, Trotsky, formalists, futurists, and constructivists, over the
connection between Art and political commitment. This subsumed such questions as Party
control of the arts, the need to create a proletarian culture, the relations between socialism
and its bourgeois cultural inheritance, and the
formulation of an appropriate socialist aesthetic.
A Communist Party resolution of 1925 refused to
stand behind any one literary faction. However,
by the time of the first Soviet Writers’ Congress
of 1934 socialist realism emerged, in an atmosphere
of Stalinist repression of all other factions, as
the victorious official Party aesthetic, sanctioned
by Maxim Gorki, N. Bukharin, and especially
A.A. Zhdanov, Secretary of the Central Committee of “ideology.”
Zhdanov defined socialist realism as the
portrayal of “reality in its revolutionary development.” Such art, he argued, must contribute to
the project of ideological transformation and
education of the working class. Other features
of socialist realism, as designated by its various
proponents, were an emphasis on factuality, the
integration of scientific and technical detail, the
application of later nineteenth-century realist
techniques to Soviet heroes, and the literary
projection of a socialist future.
Socialist realism traced its authority back
through Lenin’s notions of partinost (partisanship)
and literature as a reflection of reality to the

socialist realism

most recent interdisciplinary discussions on the
topic of skin took place at a session entitled
“Skin,” convened by Tamara Trodd and Cordelia
Warr at the 2009 Association of Art Historians
Annual Conference. Papers addressed the following themes: “Skin as sacred vessel”; “The skin of
the dead”; “Flayed skin: the myth of Marsyas”;
“Screen skins”; “Taking flight, taking shelter: in
and out of the skin”; “Collectivities: shared skins.”

statements of Marx and Engels themselves,
especially Engels’s comments on the importance
of expressing “typical” individuals and forces.
Even so, this alleged lineage is somewhat misleading. While Marx and Engels certainly saw
literature as performing an ideological function,
they stressed its highly mediated connection with
economic formations and Engels spoke of its
“relative autonomy.” Although it is true that they
both praised realism, they did not centralize it
in any coherent interventionist formulation. In
fact, the first generation of Marxist theorists such
as Antonio Labriola (1843–1904) and Georgi
Plekhanov (1856–1918) articulated essentially
contemplative accounts of the connection between
art and social reality. It was only with Lenin and
Trotsky that literature was ascribed an interventionist and partisan function in a broader
revolutionary approach. However, the interventionism championed by both men was complex
and flexible, qualified by its reference to particular historical circumstances. The more immediate impulses behind socialist realism included
Proletkult, a left-wing group of writers led by
A.A. Bogdanov (1873–1928), who, dedicated to
creating a proletarian culture which would displace bourgeois art, viewed art as an instrument
of class struggle. The Association of Proletarian
Writers (VAPP; later RAPP) also insisted on
achieving Communist cultural Hegemony. These
movements, though, were merely prefaces to the
official triumph of socialist realism. This triumph,
embodied in the Writers’ Union Congress of
1934, was essentially a result of the adoption
under Stalinism of a more politically committed
artistic attitude.
For all its crudities, socialist realism found
a powerful if ambivalent advocate in Gyorgy
Lukács (1885–1971), whose version of realism
elaborated Engels’s notion of typicality. While
Lukács opposed the modernism and experimentalism of Bertolt Brecht (1898–1956), the latter
also claimed to be a socialist realist, equating
realism with the expression of what is typical in
human relationships. In the 1930s Brecht’s work
evoked considerable hostility among the Marxist
faithful, though he has subsequently been
accepted as a major aesthetician. In the postStalinist period socialist realism declined and has
been widely subjected to criticism.

`sociology of knowledge 
Broadly defined,
an approach which seeks to understand what
counts (or has counted) as “knowledge” in various disciplines of thought by examining their
sociohistorical origins and the way that they have
evolved in response to external pressures, incentives, societal demands, modes of ideological
conditioning, etc. More specifically (and controversially), it is the claim by exponents of the
“strong program” in sociology of knowledge that
such interests in effect go all the way down
and determine the parameters of “knowledge” or
“truth” for members of some given Interpretative community, professional guild, scientific
research enterprise, etc. Thus it follows that we
should attach little or no credence to “internalist” (that is, intradisciplinary) explanations of
our “knowledge of the growth of knowledge,” or
to the kinds of validating criteria that scientists,
philosophers, and others have advanced by way
of asserting their specialized credentials. Rather,
we should reject the very terms of that distinction
between (so-called) internal and external perspectives. Such talk merely serves to dissimulate
the real operations of power, social interest, or
capital investment that standardly adopt such
a self-promoting rhetoric of pure, disinterested
seeking after truth.
This approach has been most influential in the
human and social sciences, where of course it is
working very largely on home ground, that is to
say, with methods of inquiry developed within
those same disciplines. Karl Mannheim was the
first to advance such claims on a systematic basis
and to apply the term “sociology of knowledge”
with full programmatical intent. Its sources also
include the Marxist tradition of Ideologiekritik;
the work of Max Weber and other sociologists
in the classical (mainly German) line of descent;
the Frankfurt school approach to Critical
theory as elaborated in the writings of Adorno,
Horkheimer, and Habermas; and, later, the

655

(i)
(ii)

that the history of science is very largely the
history of dead or discredited theories;
that we have no reason to suppose that our
current theories will fare any better;

(iii) that the criteria of scientific truth, method,
and validity are themselves equally open to
challenge or radical revision; and
(iv) that for all these reasons the “internalist”
approach should now give way to a fully
fledged sociological perspective; and therefore
(v) we shall need to abandon any thought of
distinguishing between the “context of discovery” and the “context of justification,”
for this can now be seen, so the argument
goes, as just another ploy by which scientists (and philosophers of science) have
sought to maintain their privileged role as
arbiters of ultimate truth.
Thus for instance it has been argued, with a
fair show of evidence, that Newton’s conception
of absolute space and time followed not so
much from empirical observation or the rigorous requirements of his theory as from a prior
(theological) framework of belief allied to a
deeply conservative sense of cosmopolitical order.
A similar case has been made for Einstein’s longrunning disagreement with Niels Bohr over the
philosophy of quantum mechanics, unwilling
as he (Einstein) was to accept its more radically
heterodox or disturbing implications. This
argument is pushed to a perverse extreme – what
many would consider a reductio ad absurdum – in
Feyerabend’s view that Galileo was scientifically
out on a limb with his heliocentric hypothesis, and
moreover that Cardinal Bellarmine had the better
of the argument in placing the interests of social
stability over those of mere “scientific” truth.
Nothing could more clearly illustrate the epistemological and ethical confusions that arise
when sociologists of knowledge lay claim to a
competence – or a right to disenfranchize the
competence of others – beyond their own (quite
legitimate) sphere of interest.
This presumption goes under various names.
Among them may be counted Postmodernism
(with its aim of debunking all the erstwhile
legitimizing “grand narratives” of truth, progress,
enlightenment, science, critique, etc.) and the
current neo-pragmatist fashion for reducing
such values to the level of consensus belief or
suasive rhetoric. (The literary critic Stanley Fish
is one who has carried this latter line of argument
to a high point of sophisticated, not to say
sophistical, art.) However, it has also provoked

sociology of knowledge

“archaeology” (or “Genealogy”) of discursive
power/knowledge formations essayed by Michel
Foucault. Where these thinkers divide is chiefly
on the issue of just how far such an argument
can or should be pressed. That is to say, what
remains of the “disciplines” in question if skeptics like Foucault – or subscribers to the “strong
program” in history and philosophy of Science
– are justified in rejecting their every last criterion
of truth, method, empirical warrant, and progress
as attained through adequate (internal) procedures
of rigorous self-monitoring, etc.? At the limit
such skepticism appears to be self-refuting since it
undermines even its own more confident assertions with regard to their real (as opposed to their
professed) motivating values and interests.
Thus Adorno, in his essay on Mannheim,
argued powerfully against any form of wholesale
sociological reduction. This was despite having
devoted much of his work to a detailed and
strenuous dialectical critique of Positivism in the
natural sciences and what he saw as its various
distorting effects upon the philosophic discourse
of Modernity. The disadvantage of all such
social-relativist arguments is that they can easily
lean over into the kind of all-out epistemological
and ethical skepticism which sees no difference
between truth and falsehood (or justice and
injustice) except as determined by this or that set
of culture-specific interests and priorities. Where
this confusion enters – most obviously in the
case of an “anarchist” philosopher of science like
Paul Feyerabend – is in simply ignoring the
crucial distinction between context of discovery and
context of justification. The former is concerned
with all those motivating factors – sociological,
religious, psychobiographical, careerist, and so
forth – which may well have influenced a scientist’s thinking at some crucial point. The latter
is concerned with those quite separate issues
that arise when a theory or hypothesis is subject
to debate – to the process of properly scientific
elaboration and critique – according to the best
currently available criteria.
At this point, predictably, the skeptic will
respond by arguing:

Sontag, Susan

656
some cogent counterargument from thinkers
concerned to resist what they see as the widespread drift toward forms of disabling value
relativism. The most effective opposition at present has come from critical realist philosophers
of science such as Rom Harré and Roy Bhaskar;
also from those (like Jürgen Habermas) who
have attempted to argue dialectically through
and beyond such wholesale challenges to the
philosophic discourse of modernity. Sociology of
knowledge is perhaps best defined as the region
of interdisciplinary debate where these issues
are nowadays pursued with maximum vigor and
scope for deep-laid differences of view.

`Sontag, Susan (1933–2004) 
From the
middle 1960s, Susan Sontag was one of the most
individual and provocative of commentators
on contemporary Culture. To all appearances
thoroughly American in her upbringing and
intellectual training – she was born in New York
City, grew up in Arizona and California, and
was educated at the Universities of Chicago and
Harvard – Susan Sontag quickly distinguished
herself by the passionate and mobile erudition of
her concern with European culture, especially the
culture associated with modernism. Her first book,
Against Interpretation and Other Essays (1966)
established a characteristically robust voice and

critical posture, especially in the title essay’s
polemic against the depleting violence practiced
by the act of interpretation on the particularity
of Art. The sketch of the ironic sensibility of contemporary mass culture in “Notes on camp” in the
same volume has been influential among theorists
of Postmodernism. Her studies of avant-gardism,
pornography, and cinema in Styles of Radical Will
(1969), the culture of images in On Photography
(1977), and the metaphorical distortions and
transformations of illness in Illness as Metaphor
(1978) and AIDS and Its Metaphors (1989) reveal
the same attentiveness to particulars and restless
impatience with institutionalized forms of knowledge and explanation. Like Roland Barthes, of
whose work she was a great admirer, she preferred
the lightness and plasticity of the short essay to
the solemnity of the academic treatise. Her work
argues tirelessly for the ethical seriousness of the
aesthetic sensibility, as a mode of consciousness
that maintains the possibility of human enlargement and transformation.

`South Asian studies 
South Asian studies, like
its other geographical area counterparts, is largely
an artifact of the North American and European
academy’s approach to scholarship in history,
economics, linguistics, and the social sciences
following the 1939–45 war. As the most senior
of the colonial projects to extend into the twentieth century, the Indian subcontinent is the
subject of a broad and well-established body of
literature in a variety of disciplines constituting what is now understood to be South Asian
studies.
In the period immediately following the
1939–45 war, scholarly inquiry and writing
relating to non-Western cultures tended to be

657
nationalists (Ghandi, Nehru, Jinna), exclusive of the
role of resistance played by the subaltern classes.
Central to this critical discourse is the purposeful
rejection of a traditionally disinterested, disengaged, and objective historiography in favor
of a “Deconstruction” of history in which an
attempt is made to expose and demystify the
elements of Ideology and Hegemony embedded
in the writing of South Asia’s historical narrative (Spivak, 1982). The oppositional critical
posture of the subaltern scholars, many of whom
represent the first generation of South Asian
intellectuals to become educated in a postcolonial,
postindependence period, is a self-conscious
attempt to establish an integrative alternative,
open to nontraditional sources and methodologies, to the established narrative.
The products of the new historiographic
approaches emerging within South Asian studies
often reveal an orientalist structure which establishes a secular “West” contrasted with a somewhat idealized religious Asian subcontinent in
which such progressive developments as a fully
developed democratic state remain a “failed
experiment” (Lele in Breckenridge and van der
Veer, 1993). This pervasive theme of the assignation of failure emerges as a key problematic
of the postcolonial historiography of South Asia,
that is, the issue of why, given their numerical
superiority and the long duration of their struggle
against the colonial oppressor, the Indian people
became a subaltern class (Guha, 1988).
As efforts to capture the subaltern voice have
intensified within South Asian studies, methodological debate has also emerged. The propriety
of nontraditional methods of research and the
utilization of unusual sources of primary material represent a continuing challenge to contemporary scholarship. This methodological latitude
has resulted in projects which have crossed the
traditional historical and ethnographic boundaries
previously defining “area studies” by appropriating philosophical (Foucault via Said) and literary (Derrida via Spivak) critical perspectives
on issues of culture and narrative. These studies
constitute what Althusser characterizes as an
“epistemological break”; a fundamentally new
paradigm for intellectual inquiry relating to the
history and cultures of South Asia.
Another significant dimension of postcolonial
scholarship relating to South Asia is the tracing

South Asian studies

departmentalized as reflections of changing
colonial groupings and political structures. As
the colonial era collapsed in Asia, Indo-China
and the Dutch East Indies became Southeast
Asia; China, Japan, and Korea became East Asia,
with India, Pakistan (and later Bangladesh), and
Sri Lanka becoming South Asia.
Contemporary scholarship in South Asian
studies is the academic heir to the earlier discipline
of Indology which, from its eighteenth-century
origins, focused primarily upon historical and
literary subjects. As the British imperial administrative structure grew through the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, Indology expanded
beyond its historical and linguistic-literary foci
into a broader range of social science disciplines,
often in response to colonial administrative
needs and prerogatives.
As the conceptual framework of “postwar”
evolved into “postcolonial,” this existing body
of historical, ethnographic, economic, and linguistic research has increasingly been viewed by
contemporary critics as informed by and representative of an essentially elitist hegemonic point
of view. Much of this postcolonial critique uses
as a theoretical base Abdel-Malik’s “Orientalism
in crisis” (1963) and Edward Said’s more widely
read Orientalism (1978) which set the parameters
for current Discourse on the ideologies underlying our historical and cultural perceptions of
the “Orient” (Said concentrated primarily on
the Middle East), particularly in relation to the
colonial project.
In the first half of the twentieth century the
salient characteristic of scholarship relating to
India and the subcontinent was its almost total
dependency upon documentation and studies
undertaken by colonial administrations (Alvares,
1991). The singular, attenuated origin of these
historical sources, spanning a period of 300 years
of writing about South Asia, has prompted the
creation of a new, confrontational historiography
known as Subaltern studies. Borrowing conceptually from Gramsci, the subaltern history
represents the displaced or unwritten narrative of
the dominated classes of imperial India (Guha and
Spivak, 1982). This history argues, for example,
that our understanding of the creation of the
independent states of India and Pakistan is
based upon the simplistic dichotomy of British
colonial overlord versus a small group of Indian

South Asian studies

658
of the juxtaposition of a politically dominant
Europe (or West) against a necessarily subservient India back to its roots in Hegel’s
treatment of India (Halbfass, 1988). Such examinations of Europe’s philosophical Historicity
have highlighted the broader role that a purposefully defined, subservient and exotic Orient, with
South Asia as a central subject, plays in allowing
a dominant, rationally defined Occident to exist.
This European construction of a Western
“self” contrasted with a South Asian “Other”
remains a focal point for contemporary intellectual historians’ discourse on the interplay and
mutual influence of European and Indian
thought. In addition to the dreamlike “Idealism
of the imagination” attributed to India by Hegel,
theoretical writings of Marx, Mill, and Weber
also offer a construction of India as a prerational
“Empire of the Imaginary” (Inden, 1990) against
which a rational, positivist West can be contrasted
and defined. It is Inden’s theory that this antithetical South Asian “other” remains embedded
in scholarship in a variety of disciplines – anthropology, economics, and political philosophy –
thus limiting the “agency” of modern South
Asian intellectuals and the evolution of Indian
political and cultural institutions.
The role of the literary creations of the Raj –
British India as a beneficent, paternalistic, even
sentimental force – is critical to understanding
the cultural contexts within which South Asian
studies evolved in the latter half of the twentieth
century (Chakravarty, 1989). The unapologetically racist “white man’s burden” informing
nineteenth-century England’s unequal encounter,
as exemplified by Kipling, with their imperial
subjects became, in the twentieth century, the
disillusioned Liberalism of E.M. Forster.
The body of nineteenth- and twentieth-century
popular fiction in English relating to South Asia
represents, in the aggregate, a narrative of sustained
stereotypes cumulatively evolved over the three
centuries of the colonial project in India. The
“inscrutable” Oriental of the nineteenth century
became more primal and predictable in the
twentieth; a superstitious native character was
transformed into an essentially religious, even
spiritually transcendent cultural icon, uneducated but wise, with characteristics often previously portrayed as effeminate now idealized as
pacific (Nandy, 1983). From Kipling through

Ghandi, the extent to which these stereotypes,
which were woven into the “official” colonial
administrative historical sources of scholarship
about South Asia, continue to undergird and
inform postcolonial perspectives is a central
tenet of the critique of Orientalism.
As the empire was transformed into the Commonwealth, the cultural and intellectual legacies
of the Raj mentality, particularly in examinations
of early South Asian civilizations, continued to
provide a sometimes unconscious subtext for
the characterization of the religious, social, and
linguistic traditions and subsequent influences
of Vedic and pre-Vedic Indian civilizations.
The earliest examples of British scholarship
emanating from the subcontinent focused on
religious and linguistic “histories” of Hinduism
and Sanskrit. The implications of the long-term
colonial interest in the linguistic “mapping” of the
subcontinent extend into the present day. The
sociolinguistic issue of the “Naturalization” of
the English language within the Indian experience
has emerged as an intersection of debate and
scholarship. The role of the language of the colonial suppressors in contrast or confrontation
with the use of the vernacular languages of the
subcontinent remains a volatile political issue in
India with deep and often disparate nationalistic
implications.
The orientalist enterprise also embraced the
study of Indian literatures. This critical tradition,
beginning with eighteenth-century treatises on
Vedic civilizations, utilized an Enlightenment
conception of literature (as, for example, an
“ordered” body of work in an indigenous
language), while maintaining an adherence, over
time, to prevailing European intellectual themes.
Again, contemporary critics hold that this colonial representation of the “native” literatures of
the subcontinent, although often appropriating
an objective, disinterested positivist posture, in
fact was unable to escape the European assertion of political and cultural dominance in Asia
(Dharwadker, in Breckenridge and van der Veer,
1993).
In general, postcolonial scholarship in the

The movement idealized the Old South as an
organic society and as an antidote to the dehumanizing forces of science, industrialism, and
secularism. Like T.S. Eliot, whom they greatly
revered, they are best described as radical conservatives: Tate aimed to turn the Agrarians into
an academy of “Southern positive reactionaries”
and wanted their main manifesto, I’ll Take
My Stand (1930), to be entitled “Tracts against
Communism.” The Agrarians advocated a return
to the land and an ideal of subsistence farming
(see Who Owns America? 1936), but by 1937 its
leaders were disillusioned and decided that the
northern capitalist-industrialist economy could not
be reformed and that their philosophy could
best be promulgated by a university-based literary critical movement. Ransom founded The
Kenyon Review, and the New Critical campaign,
with all its associated summer schools, textbooks, and student primers, was born.

`Southern Agrarians 
An American political
movement of the late 1920s and 1930s. Several
of its leaders, such as John Crowe Ransom and
Allen Tate, were literary critics, and the movement played a crucial role in American literary
studies since they subsequently went on to

`speech acts 
A speech act is an utterance which
constitutes all or part of an act. For example,
in saying (or writing) “I bet you a pound that
your baby will be a girl,” I am engaging in the
act of betting. Other obvious speech acts include
promises and warnings.
The theory of speech acts was developed by
the Oxford philosopher J.L. Austin in the 1930s
and was the subject of 12 William James Lectures
which Austin delivered at Harvard University
in the United States in 1955. The publication
of these lectures (Austin, 1962) and of John
Searle’s (1969) subsequent development of the
theory brought it to the attention of linguists
(Sadock, 1974; Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975;
Hymes, 1967/1986; Schegloff, 1968/1986), language teachers, psychologists (Bruner, 1975; Bates,
1976), and literary theorists, to whom its appeal

visible presence in studies dealing with issues
of Culture and Class. Also evident among the
theoretical and critical bases of South Asianists
is the influence of the structuralist and poststructuralist work of Derrida, Foucault,
Althusser, and Barthes. The most salient of
these influences is that of Foucault, whose framing devices of power and knowledge as well as his
overall penchant for demystification, has provided a theoretical foundation, vocabulary, and
an aggressive methodological stance for much of
the postcolonial discourse relating to South Asia.
Finally, as alternative narratives emerge for
South Asian studies, there are those who are
mindful of the inherent danger of creating a
separatist intellectual project which, in a mirror
image of its colonial predecessor, is disdainful
of the interdependence of the contrasting voices
of the suppressor and the suppressed (Said, in
Guha and Spivak, 1987). This issue of exclusivity will continue to influence future standards of
method and interpretation in this increasingly
eclectic and prolific field of inquiry.

was immediate. The influence of speech-act theory
remains strongest in cross-cultural pragmatics
(Blum-Kulka et al., 1989), in communicative
language teaching (Widdowson, 1978), and in
some literary theories (Petrey, 1990).
The reason why many nonphilosophers found
speech-act theory so appealing was their feeling
that here at last was a “natural language philosophy” concerned with the actual use of everyday language rather than with the truth or falsity
of a restricted set of invented sentences. By the
1930s, when Austin began to work on the notion
of speech as action, the truth-oriented logical
positivists had achieved such a reduction in the
number of “factually significant” sentences that
any hope of extending the methods of logic to deal
with a major part of natural language looked
unlikely to be fulfilled.
Austin writes against the background of “the
descriptive fallacy” (1962, p. 3), the belief that
the purpose of any declarative sentence is to
describe a state of affairs correctly – leading to
truth – or incorrectly – leading to falsity. In fact,
Austin insists, there are many declarative sentences
which do not describe, and in the case of which
it makes no sense to ask whether they are true or
false, namely those used in the making of speech
acts. Austin calls such sentences “performatives,”
and uses the term “constatives” for sentences
which describe. Only constatives are true or
false; performatives are “happy” or “unhappy,”
depending on whether the circumstances in
which they are uttered are appropriate. These
performatives, then, have “felicity conditions,”
whereas only constatives have “truth conditions.”
Having drawn this distinction, however, Austin
sets about breaking it down by showing that
(i) constatives can be unhappy in the sense that
their presuppositions and implications may not
be fulfilled; (ii) performatives can be false in
the sense of “conflicting with the facts”; and
(iii) every utterance is in fact a speech act. This
is because, although no verb naming the speech act
being performed – a “speech-act verb” – need be
included in it, any speech act is expandable into
an utterance having such a verb in it.
Consider the utterance “Fire.” This may function as the speech act of warning, and if it does,
it is expandable into the explicit form “I warn
you that there is a fire.” By this argument, every
apparently constative utterance is expandable

into the speech-act “statement,” since any utterance can be prefaced by “I state that.” Therefore
all linguistic behavior can be considered speech
action. In addition to its “propositional content,” any utterance has a particular “force” and
all that remains to do is to classify these forces.
Searle (1969) attempts a classification into sets
of rules for the performance of particular speech
acts. For example, the rules for promising specify that what is being promised must (i) be a future
action, (ii) which the promisee would like to
happen, (iii) and which it is not obvious that the
promisor would do anyway, (iv) but which s/he
intends to do, (v) and is, having promised,
obliged to do. Searle (1969, pp. 66–7) provides
rules for several other speech acts, and draws on
these in explaining how speakers are able to use
and comprehend “indirect speech acts.”
In many cases the form of a speech act conflicts with its function. For example, what looks
like a promise (“I promise to have you locked up
if you do that”) may strike us as having quite a
different force, in this example probably “warning.” We know that this cannot be a proper
promise because one of the rules for promising
is broken, in so far as we must assume that the
hearer would not prefer being locked up to not
being locked up. We also know that it is a warning because one of the rules for warning is
adhered to, namely the rule that what is being
warned against must be something the hearer
would not like to happen.
Searle, unlike Austin, claims that the theory of
meaning is the theory of speech acts, and to
make this claim more palatable he provides a set
of rules for the speech acts of referring and predicating. However, these incorporate all of the
difficulties faced by traditional theories of truth,
and both Austin, explicitly, and Searle, implicitly,
remain wedded to a theory of truth conditionally
derived from literal meaning.
This aspect of speech-act theory has tended to
be overlooked outside philosophy itself, where,
it is possible to argue, the influence of the theory
can lead to insufficient emphasis being placed on
the “what” of a given speech act: it is obviously
as important to understand what is being promised as it is to understand that a promise is being
made.
Furthermore, it is not clear that the utterances
that form naturally occurring Discourse actually

`Steiner, George (1929–) 
American literary
critic. George Steiner is one of the most distinctive figures of twentieth-century criticism.
During a long and distinguished career, he,
probably more than any other contemporary
intellectual, has reflected in a serious, provocative,
and far-reaching manner on what precisely it
is to be a critic in the modern world, and why
it is still a role – and, he would also say, a

responsibility – worth preserving. Born in Paris,
emigrating to the United States in 1940, Steiner
was educated at the Universities of Chicago,
Harvard, and Oxford. Since 1969 he has been
an extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College,
Cambridge, and, since 1974, Professor of English
and comparative literature at the University of
Geneva. In 1994 he became Weidenfeld visiting
professor of European comparative literature at
the University of Oxford.
The critic, according to Steiner, can fulfill
three tasks: first, to “feel ahead,” reminding the
reader that the Text stands in a complex, provisional relation to time; second, to “connect,”
acting as intermediary and custodian of the work
of the writer; third, and most important of all, to
“judge” the Art of one’s own age. The project,
addressed most vividly in the essay “Humane
literacy” in Language and Silence (1967), is to
“engage the presence” of the text, to do one’s best
to read “as total human beings, by example of precision, fear and delight.” “Literary criticism,”
he argued at the beginning of Tolstoy or
Dostoevsky (1960), “should arise out of a debt of
love.” Steiner’s own work has always been characterized by an intense and insistent commitment to personal feeling, making his writing, in
both form and content, as much the result of “risks
of the heart” as of intellectual reflection.
The task of the critic is to mediate: “only
through the critic’s constant and anguished
recognition of the distance which separates his
craft from that of the poet, can such mediation
be accomplished.” It is a theme that runs like a
thread through all of Steiner’s most important
essays and books. In Real Presences (1989),
responding to the radical doubt in Poststructuralism, Steiner insists that the critic is
answerable to a text “in a very specific sense,
at once moral, spiritual and psychological.” To
communicate the aesthetic experience requires
“tact, technical authority and control of a rare
order” which, claims Steiner, runs the risk of
embarrassment; such embarrassment, he adds,
“in bearing witness to the poetic, to the entrance
into our lives of the mystery of otherness in art
. . . is of a metaphysical-religious kind.”
One of Steiner’s most important critical
concerns (and one he shares with one of his
most significant intellectual influences, Walter
Benjamin) is the task, and implications, of

Steiner, George

conform to clearly definable conditions or rules.
A contrasting view considers the recognition of
“speech acts” to be based on the interactants’
common knowledge of each other, of the situation, and of the surrounding discourse. On this
basis, interactants infer the attitude that a
speaker is likely to have to propositions, and the
exploration of “propositional attitudes” has
become central in philosophically oriented work
on language and cognition (see Lycan, 1990).
A still more radical view holds that it is
impossible to consider a “proposition” in isolation from a “force” and vice versa (Quine, 1960).
From this view, the act of betting is not isolatable from its content, and the act, if the notion
makes sense at all, mentioned at the beginning
of this entry is the act of “betting you a pound
that your baby will be a girl.” Comparatively, the
“attitude,” if the notion makes sense at all,
expressed in any utterance of the form, “I believe
that x” is not the attitude of believing, but the
attitude of believing that x. It is then tempting
to conceive of “meaning,” not as a property of
propositions, but as a full-blown, if fleeting, relationship between a time, a language user, a set
of circumstances, and an utterance (Davidson,
1984; Lewis, 1970).

story/plot

662
translation. In his major work, After Babel
(1975), Steiner presents the practice and possibility
of translation as the most formidable of all
cultural problems. Translation is portrayed as a
universal ingredient in all acts of comprehension.
He criticizes reductive approaches to the study of
language which seek to “cure” it of its fictiveness
and Ambiguity. He suggests, as an alternative,
a more adequate conception which strives to
accommodate and appreciate, rather than exclude
and deny, the “slippery, ambiguous, altering,
subconscious or traditional contextual reflexes” of
language. These maligned qualities of language are,
he insists, vital to our survival:
Ours is the ability, the need, to gainsay or
“unsay” the world, to image and speak it otherwise. In that capacity in its biological and social
evolution, may lie some of the clues to the question of the origins of human speech and the
multiplicity of tongues. It is not, perhaps, “a
theory of information” that will serve us best
in trying to clarify the nature of language, but a
“theory of misinformation”. (1975, p. 228)

Language, he goes on to argue, is essentially
“fictive” because “the enemy is ‘reality’ ”:
We secrete from within ourselves the grammar,
the mythologies of hope, of fantasy, of selfdeception without which we would have been
arrested at some rung of primate behaviour or
would, long since, have destroyed ourselves. It is
our syntax, not the physiology of the body or the
thermodynamics of the planetary system, which
is full of tomorrows . . . We speak, we dream
ourselves free of the organic trap. (1975, p. 238)

Steiner’s most provocative anxiety, expressed in
an extraordinarily varied range of essays, novels,
and academic texts, is that the atrocities of the
1914–18 war and the Holocaust have threatened,
if not dealt a fatal blow to, the entire Western
tradition of “humane literacy.’’ A central question,
addressed time and again by Steiner, is why
do the humanities not civilize? His phrase, in
Language and Silence, about the cry in the poem
perhaps seeming more real than the cry in the
street, sustains, in the publications that followed,
a melancholic echo. He warned of a creeping
banality produced by mass culture, a culture
without privacy or memory. In Bluebeard’s

Castle (1971) he considers the possibility that
so-called high culture’s abstract speculation may
infect human consciousness with an ennui out of
which may fester a fascination with savagery. A
“decent” alternative for Culture, one which
Steiner, in theory, has always found difficult to
resist, is silence, the tacit admission that the civilizing power of a culture based on “the word” is
an illusion (the most obvious influence here for
Steiner is T.W. Adorno).
Steiner’s own criticism has continued to
struggle with the Paradox of making the claims
of silence heard. He has come, for some, to
resemble the last critic, the critic who reflects
on the death of the critical tradition in a postAuschwitz world. This critic writes books on
how books may become redundant, and on how
professional criticism may be discouraged. There
is certainly a Steiner for whom criticism is but
“a eunuch’s shadow,” an activity lived “at secondhand.” There is also, however, a Steiner for
whom criticism is one of the most decent, most
precious of activities, a powerful affirmation of
a humanist agenda. This critic reads great literature as though it has upon him “an urgent
design.” Steiner is both of these critics; he
embodies their contradictory natures. In doing
so, he represents a peculiarly modern reading of
the critic.

`story/plot 
A distinction drawn by narrative theorists across a range of otherwise diverse schools
and cultural-linguistic backgrounds. (Thus, for
instance, fabula/suzhet were the terms adopted
by Russian formalism; histoire/discours in the
idiom of French narratologists such as Gérard
Genette and the early Roland Barthes.)
Though recently developed to a high point of
sophisticated treatment, this distinction is basically quite simple and will strike most readers
– as it did E.M. Forster in his book Aspects of the
Novel – as a matter of intuitive self-evidence.
The fictional story can best be defined as the
sequence of episodes, actions, or events as they

663
plot/story dualism. Clearly there is a sense in
which any attempt to extricate the one from the
other – to reconstruct the story line as if it somehow existed apart from (or prior to) its narrative
emplotment – must soon encounter obstacles.
After all, it is surely mistaken to suppose that the
novelist started out with some straightforward
story-telling purpose in mind, and then worked
it up into a complicated form for the keener
delectation of super-subtle readers or exegetes.
More than that, there is something decidedly
naive – and counter to formalist principle – in the
idea that story relates to plot in much the same
way as content to form or narrative material to
its elaboration in fully fledged artistic or novelistic guise. If there is one central doctrine that
unites all varieties of formalist aesthetic, it is
the argument against such misconceived and
crudely reductive dichotomies.
Deconstructionist critics – Jonathan Culler for
one – have had much to say about the problems
that result from this conflict of method and
principle. Thus Culler points out that there are
two different logics, two modes of intelligibility,
required in the reading of narrative texts. On
the one hand, when reading for the story, it is
matter of suspending disbelief, construing events
as if they pertained to the real-world order of temporal succession or unilinear cause and effect, and
thereby consenting to the fictive illusion which
affords our more usual (nontheoretical) kinds of
readerly enjoyment. On the other hand, when
reading for the plot, we have to recognize that this
is not at all the way in which narrative actually
works. It then becomes apparent, paradoxically
enough, that effects are causes of (what we took
to be) causes and that causes are effects of (what
we took to be) effects. According to the story-line
version, Oedipus is punished with blindness, exile,
and death as a result – a causal consequence – of
his having killed his father Laius and married his
mother Jocasta. However, on a formalist (plotoriented) reading in the deconstructive mode, this
logic is subjected to a point-for-point reversal,
whereby Oedipus is constrained to kill his father
and marry his mother in order that the play
should lead up to a suitably tragic conclusion.
Or again, take the question, much debated by
literary critics, of just why Hamlet delays so long
in exacting revenge against Claudius, given that
(on his own submission) he has adequate

story/plot

might have occurred if removed from the realm
of fictive or novelistic Discourse and rearranged
(so to speak) on a real-time basis of “one thing
after another.” That is, story concerns those
elements of chronology, causality, temporal
sequence, human acts and their subsequent outcome, etc. that we interpret in accordance with
our everyday (non-fictive) knowledge and experience of the world. Plot may be defined, in contrast, as the sum total of narrative devices by
which a novelist contrives to reorder these basic
story-line components and thus create a heightened degree of interest, variety, or suspense.
Some works of fiction (for example, novels in the
realist or naturalistic mode) will tend to manifest
no great discrepancy between story and plot,
since their aim is to create a sense of verisimilitude by reproducing the quotidian (real-world)
conditions of temporal and causal sequence.
Others – from Tristram Shandy to Texts in the
modernist, postmodernist, and experimental
genres – go various ways around to complicate
the plot/story relationship and resist any reading
that would seek (naively) to collapse the difference between them.
Many critics have contributed to refining and
developing the terms of this seminal distinction.
Indeed, it has always played a crucial part in
the formalist theory of literature, beginning with
Aristotle’s remarks about the various kinds of
plot structure (“simple” or “complex”) to be
found in ancient Greek tragic drama, and taken
up again whenever critics have returned to the
Aristotelian idea of poetics as an orderly, methodical, or scientific quest for the characteristic
forms and modalities of literary discourse. What
is most impressive about later work in this field
– from the Russian formalist school of the 1920s
to French (or French-influenced) Narratology
of the 1950s to the 1990s – is the degree of
conceptual precision attained in its analysis of
the various transformational structures used in the
passage from story to plot. Thus, for instance,
Genette provides an object lesson in the shrewd
deployment of analytic categories – tense structure, deviant chronology, patterns of narrative
parallelism, repetition, prolepsis, and so forth –
which genuinely serves to deepen and extend
our awareness of the complexities involved. At
the same time this very sophistication of method
has raised new problems with regard to the

Strauss, Leo

664
motive, cause, and opportunity. Attending to
the “story” mostly means seeking some depthpsychological or character-based account of how
the drama unfolds from one crisis to the next.
In formalist terms, however, such purported
“explanations” are entirely beside the point.
Hamlet is not a “character” with motives,
desires, Oedipal hang-ups, or obscure psychological
depths. Rather he is a name to which we standardly impute a number of functional (plotdetermined) traits, among them the markers
“introvert,” “brooding,” “mother-fixated,”
“incapable of decisive action,” etc. So when it is
asked why Hamlet delays for so long, then the
answer, quite simply, is that this is a five-act play
in the established revenge–tragedy tradition, and
that if he did not delay then the plot would
collapse somewhere around the middle of Act One.
The same would apply to those novels – Jane
Austen’s protypically – whose outcome equates the
heroine’s good fortune with her finding a suitable
marriage partner after various ill-advised choices
along the way. According to the story-line
account, those choices and that outcome can all
be construed as resulting understandably from
what went before, that is, from certain crucial
episodes and events combined with certain traits
in the heroine’s character which first predisposed
her to fix on the wrong man and then, in the
wisdom of hindsight, to place her affections elsewhere. However, this account can just as well be
run in reverse. Then it is a matter of generic
expectation (or plot requirement) that the novel
should conclude with a happy marriage; that
this should stand in marked contrast to those
previous upsets to her sense of self-esteem; and
therefore that the novel’s dénouement should
retroactively dictate the whole course of foregoing actions, choices, and events.
Hence Culler’s point about the “double logic”
– the conflict or interference of narrative codes –
that results from our attempting to read simultaneously for the story and the plot. It is a point
also made, if in more oblique fashion, by postmodernist writers like Italo Calvino who contrive
all manner of vertiginous effects (or techniques
of textual mise-en-abîme) by switching constantly from one level to the other. The result,
as in Calvino’s novel If on a Winter’s Night A
Traveller, is to create a perpetual uncertainty in
the reader about just where those levels merge

or intersect, and just what role s/he (the reader)
occupies in relation to her or his fictive surrogates
in the text. If Calvino thus preempts every last
move of a formalist (or a deconstructive) reading,
then the same might be said of Sterne’s Tristram
Shandy or Cervantes’s Don Quixote. Indeed, as
many critics have noted, the “anti-novel” has a
history going back as far as – if not further than
– its mainstream realist counterpart. Nor perhaps
should one expect otherwise, given the pattern
of curious metaleptic reversals (the disruption
of chronology and cause–effect sequence) that
appears at every turn in these attempts to differentiate narrative “story” and “plot.”

`Strauss, Leo (1899–1973) 
German émigré
political philosopher and historian of political
thought. He studied at the Universities of Marburg
and Hamburg, where he came into contact
with Edmund Husserl and the young Martin
Heidegger. He left Germany in 1932 for France
and England. He later went to the United States,
where he was professor of political science at
the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1968.
It is estimated that he graduated approximately
100 doctoral students. When Strauss died in
1973, eulogies poured forth. His students compared him to Socrates – he was a man to be
experienced. They were enchanted, delighted,
excited, captivated, confused, awestruck, mildly
stunned, even dizzy. There are now second- and
third-generation Straussians, as they are known
in the profession. They all share the same devotion and ardent faith in the teaching of Strauss.
What is the source of all this excitement?
Strauss wrote some 15 books and 80 articles
on the history of political thought from Socrates
to Nietzsche. His best-known books are listed

665
the erotic object of the philosopher’s quest. But
there is the rub. It seems to me that if we accept
Nietzsche’s premises we must also accept his
conclusion – if the truth is dark, then we must
renounce it and live according to the humanizing illusions, the life-giving myths we create for
ourselves. By accepting Nietzsche’s premises and
rejecting his conclusion, Strauss cultivates an
elite that is more vulgar than it is wise.

`structuralism
 A method of inquiry which
proceeds from the premise that cultural activity
can be approached and analyzed objectively as
a science. Structuralists attempt to discern the
elements in their area of specialization which
correspond to a unitary organization. Once these
elements are found, they are located in a web-like
relationship to one another. The relationships
constitute the overall structure which is assumed
to be ultimately at the root of the cultural phenomenon under discussion. Once this structure
is discovered in the rigor of its composition, all
activity in the field can be explained in its terms.
Structuralism is usually considered to have
begun with the linguistics of Ferdinand de
Saussure, although it was the Russian structural
linguist Roman Jakobson who gave the movement
its name. Saussure called for a science of
signification, Semiotics, of which linguistics was
to be the privileged example. For Saussure, all
linguistic practice (including nonverbal) could
theoretically be analyzed in terms of a deeper
structure rooted ultimately in the biology of the
human mind. He found that meaning is structured
as a relation of difference between elements, that
a word has its meaning not because of what it
refers to, but because it does not mean the same
as other words. The linguistic Sign is structured
as a relation between the signified (the referent)
and the signifier (the lexical unit). Signs are

structuralism

below. Strauss was no ordinary historian of ideas.
He believed that all the wise or ancient philosophers in the West shared the same set of
beliefs about man, politics, goodness, and truth.
However, this was a secret wisdom, which was
guarded by seven seals. Strauss was convinced that
the truth was dangerous and that all wise men
shared his view. As a result, he concluded that all
of the great books in the history of political
thought contained an exoteric or public teaching
as well as an esoteric or private message. The former was a salutary teaching or noble lie intended
for the consumption of the many, whereas the
latter was the dangerous truth intended only for
the few. There is no doubt that much of Strauss’s
appeal has its source in his seductive combination
of elitism and secrecy. Strauss confessed that he
was himself an esoteric commentator on esoteric
texts (1968, p. 27). In light of all this secrecy, is
it possible to penetrate his thought? Some of his
disciples say that this is not possible. I believe that
Strauss is fairly simple to understand. In my
view, the most important key to his thought is his
interpretation of Plato.
Strauss is considered by his disciples as well as
his critics to be a follower of Plato, whom he
regarded as the personification of ancient wisdom.
However, Strauss’s understanding of Plato is
radically at odds with the usual view. On close
examination, Strauss’s Plato turns out to be
a postmodern follower of Nietzsche. Strauss
regarded Thrasymachus (not Socrates) as Plato’s
true spokesman (1964, p. 77). According to
Strauss, Plato must have known that there are
absolutely no grounds for our cherished moral
beliefs. As Thrasymachus teaches, justice is nothing more than the advantage of the stronger:
those in power decide what counts as true, right,
and good. Truth and goodness are therefore a
function of power. Strauss follows Thrasymachus
in thinking that the just man is a fool who has
fallen prey to the fictions invented by power.
In Strauss’s view, however, the world needs to be
populated by such fools; this is why Plato
silences Thrasymachus but does not refute him.
According to Strauss, the bulk of the Republic is
a pious fraud intended for the consumption of the
herd. The truth is a luxury intended only for the
few who hunger for the reality behind the myths
and illusions of the cave. Strauss insists that
though the truth is dark, even “sordid,” it is still

structured in relation to each other in accordance with the principle of differential relations,
but are also organized in a further relation. This
relation is the one which constitutes Binary
oppositions, relations between opposites which
are charged with important meanings in human
Culture. Saussure saw this deeper structure as
constituting a sort of ideal speech community
which overdetermined the utterance of an individual (see Langue/parole). It was the langue
itself which interested him, and he saw no point
in analyzing the parole. He theorized that this type
of relationship between a communal root and an
individual practice was at the root of all cultural
practice, and his insight had a profound effect on
the structuralists who followed him. Structuralist
theorists in fields such as Cultural anthropology, Narratology, and linguistics all proceed upon assumptions very similar to his.
The linguistic theory of Roman Jakobson
developed from a meeting of structuralism and
Russian formalism. However, he did not simply accept Saussure’s privileging of langue over
parole, since his own interest was in the operation of an individual’s parole. This included,
for Jakobson, the description of the phoneme,
the sound unit which is a meaningful part of the
linguistic Sign in conversation. The reason for the
importance Jakobson placed upon parole was his
interest in the way in which language functions
in practice. This interest developed from his days
with the Prague linguistic circle to his later
work in the United States.
It was in this later phase that he was influenced by the work of the American semiotic
theorist C.S. Peirce. Peirce’s theorizing of the
three types of linguistic sign (icon, index, and
Symbol) helped to make Jakobson more aware
of the relations inherent in the practice of
signification, a major development in structural
linguistics from Saussure’s denigration of parole
in favor of langue. Peirce’s dynamic model provided Jakobson with an improved model.
In addition to these variations from Saussure,
Jakobson made more of a distinction implicit
in Saussure’s work, between Metaphor and
metonymy. Jakobson saw these two figures as
constituting a binary opposition which is at the
root of literary practice. From these two fundamental elements of his work, Jakobson drew out
a practice of Literary criticism which he used

in analyses that are regarded as the epitome of
structuralist literary criticism. He used his structural linguistics to pick out the semantic and
phonemic correspondences which structure the
literary text, coming to the conclusion that this
was how all texts were constructed.
At the same time as Jakobson was developing
his theories, the French anthropologist Claude
Lévi-strauss was similarly concerned with the
way in which meaning is produced. Proceeding
from structuralist assumptions similar to those of
Jakobson, Lévi-Strauss investigated the relations
between the myths of various indigenous
American societies. He found that they operated
in a homologous pattern which could not be
coincidental. He could only explain this by
recourse to a coherent theory of the production
of mythic meaning. For Lévi-Strauss, there were
fundamental meanings which were represented in
all of the mythic cycles he analyzed. These meanings were based upon basic narrative patterns
which he found to be present in all of the Indian
myths. He saw these narrative patterns as composed of the binary oppositions theorized by
Saussure. He thought that these patterns were
features rooted ultimately in the structure of the
human mind, based upon the biology of the
brain and the neural network.
Later structuralist developments in narratology
and semiotics were based upon a fusion of the
work of Jakobson and Lévi-Strauss. One recurring element is that the work of the structuralist
theorist results in an objective theory which can
then be applied to all texts. This is the project
of theorists such as A.J. Greimas, Gérard
Genette, and Claude Bremond.
It is also the initial intent of Roland Barthes
at the beginning of S/Z (1990). Barthes’s book,
however, marks the development of Poststructuralism, in that his attempt to codify Balzac’s
short story results in a radical interspersing of
his own comments with Balzac’s text. The result
is that there is an undoing of the boundaries
between literary text and critical text, a movement
which destroys any pretension to scientific
objectivity of the kind claimed by structuralism.
This maneuver complements the analysis
of Saussurean linguistics in Jacques Derrida
(1976), the moment which marks the development
of Deconstruction. Derrida follows Saussure’s
insight into the way in which the linguistic sign

667
certainties were being questioned, for example,
in the evolutionary sciences. Saussure’s linguistics
put paid to the notion that meaning is rooted
ultimately in some transcendental essence which
exists outside social practice. By noting that
meaning is structured in a closed sign-system,
Saussure effectively cut off signification from a
metaphysical basis, from God. The consequences
of this maneuver, which he himself may not
have realized, were that cultural practices could
be analyzed purely as social constructs, and that
structuralism could take the place of a science
which explained such phenomena objectively.
In a sense therefore, structuralism constituted a
form of materialist practice.
Nevertheless, there are reasons why structuralists never quite attained the scientific objectivity they claimed. It is because of such factors
that deconstruction and poststructuralism
developed. These later cultural movements came
from a realization that structuralist practice
could in fact be constructing the very relationships
it claimed to be finding in texts, myths, or
linguistic utterances. Thus structuralism is a
reading practice rather than a science which
somehow locates structures already existing in the
area being investigated. The example of Barthes
shows that the attempt to define exhaustively the
features of even a realist short story is bound to
fail. Barthes’s categories, his Codes, break down
into subcategories, multiple readings, dispersals
of meaning over wide areas of connotation.
Structuralist literary criticism fails to contain
these meanings, to define the text once and for
all. Barthes’s book exemplifies structuralist practice at its most intense and its most unsuccessful.
Even as he tries to isolate coherent meanings to
uncover the structure which is assumed to be at
the heart of Balzac’s short story, Barthes finds
meanings multiplying out of control.
Following on from this situation, it is possible
to see structuralism itself as in fact constituting
an attempt to control meanings, to define texts
in accordance with preexisting assumptions. The
experience of Barthes and Derrida with regard to
the explosion of meaning from the structuralist
framework has profound implications for the
structuralist project as a whole. For deconstructionists and poststructuralists, the construction
of an objective science is ultimately impossible, precisely because objectivity is impossible.

structuralism

is constructed. However, he questions Saussure’s
own theorizing of binary oppositions. He
undoes binary oppositions by showing that they
depend upon their force for an assumption that
certain meanings are associated with the other
element in the opposition. Thus the pair is not
mutually exclusive: the one will always be contaminated with elements of the other. Derrida
moves on to consider the consequences of his
analysis for theoretical discourse, especially with
regard to the Tropes utilized in philosophy. By
doing so, he links his concern with linguistics with
his interest in philosophy. He applies his insights
into structural linguistics to philosophy by
searching philosophical texts for the same meanings he finds in Saussure’s linguistics. The reason
for this is that he considers Saussure’s linguistics
to represent a nostalgic longing for presence,
especially since Saussure denigrates the written sign
in favor of the purely verbal. By a series of rigorous readings of philosophical texts, readings
which he conducts in the manner of a literary
critic, he shows that the Western metaphysical
tradition also privileges presence. Structuralism
thus provides the initiator of deconstruction
with the very tools he needs, which is one characteristic of the method of deconstruction itself.
Derrida sets up a binary opposition between
the literary and the philosophical only to deconstruct it. He shows that philosophical texts
utilize literary motifs to such an extent that they
cannot logically be said to be something which is
not at all literary in the manner of a structural
opposition: he deconstructs this asumption. His
initial maneuver regarding structuralism therefore
provides the basis for his analysis of Western
metaphysics, and the analytical method he uses
is the same in both cases. For Derrida, deconstruction is the name of both this maneuver and
the impetus to put into question philosophy’s
assumption of presence, a questioning which can
take on the character of a political strategy.
Deconstruction has not ended the protect of
structuralism: rather, it utilizes it as part of its
own maneuvers in the way that Derrida uses
Saussure. The reason for this is that some of
structuralism’s insights are still considered
fundamental in the history of the humanities,
whether or not individual theorists accept its
claims to be a universal science. Structuralism
developed at a historical moment when many

structuralism

668
Accordingly, structuralism can be seen to
impose its own reading upon a text.
Such a conclusion accords neatly with openly
materialist readings of the project of structuralism. By attempting to define meanings by reference to an ultimate structure which exists prior
to history and the social in the structure of the
human mind itself, structuralism tries to escape
contingency. Saussure’s linguistics not only
remove God from the play of meaning, but they
also attempt to replace God with Structure. It is
the moment of Saussure’s initial discovery of the
precisely social nature of signification which is
of interest to materialists. His collapsing of that
discovery back into an essentialist structure is
seen as a retrograde movement, and one which is
precisely ideological. There is therefore a fundamental contradiction inherent in the structuralist
impulse, a conflict between a historicizing movement which seeks to detach meaning from transcendent being, and an ahistoricizing tendency
to root meaning in a sort of deep structure.
It is not only structuralist linguists and literary
theorists who provide examples of the problem
of an essentialism: structural psychologists do so
also. The linkage between structural linguistics
and psychology was made explicit by Jakobson in
a call for an interdisciplinary approach by which
psychology would take into account developments in structuralist approaches in other areas.
The psychologist who produced such a linkage
was to apply the methods of structural linguistics
to the way in which meaning is developed psychologically. The implications of the structuralist
claim to be an objective universal science are
quite clear here: Jakobson assumes that structural
linguistics has uncovered the laws by which
language operates. Moreover, since those laws
are based upon the deeper structure of the
human mind, they should be equally applicable
to the areas covered by psychology.
In a similar manner this very area was
explored by Jean Piaget. Piaget was interested in
the development of the intellect during childhood and also the progression of epistemology
itself. His approach to these two problems was
based upon an assumption common to both: that
the laws discernible in his structuralist developmental psychology were fundamental also to
epistemology in general. In other words, the laws
he attempted to isolate as the basis for the

development of the human intellect were also
the laws of epistemology. He utilized a form of
structural linguistics in order to uncover these laws,
which he stressed as fundamental to the way in
which the human being thinks.
The relationship between structural linguistics
and psychology provides an example of the interdisciplinary techniques made possible by the
emergence of structuralism. The reason for this,
of course, was that the differing disciplines shared
the same assumptions at the root of their structuralist approach. Nevertheless, this movement
helped sow the seeds of the more sophisticated
poststructuralist concerns with such forms of
interdisciplinary work, another area in which the
successors of structuralism owe some of their
developments to maneuvers made by structuralists themselves.
The production of a general science of signification which is not limited solely to verbal
communication is the result of this interdisciplinary approach. Semiotics developed from the
structuralist impulse by and through Jakobson’s
integration with the work of Peirce. The result has
been the emergence of semiotic theoreticians
such as Umberto Eco. For these theorists, language serves as the example par excellence of
the operation of a sign system, and provides the
model for discussion of all other sign systems.
However, this discussion is not simply subservient to linguistics. In fact, conclusions drawn
from study of other sign systems, for example, gesture or socially constituted phenomena such as
traffic signs, can be utilized to modify the study
of the sign systems of language. In this respect,
semiotics attempts rigorously to achieve the
status of a science of signs, following on from the
structuralist impetus to objectivity.
Overall, structuralism must be seen in terms
of its relations with other movements as well as
in terms of its own internal relations. There were
disagreements within structuralism which proved
useful in developing it further, such as Jakobson’s
development of structural linguistics in directions contrary to that envisaged by Saussure. The
movements which followed it, poststructuralism
and deconstruction, while they utilize structuralism as a starting point, develop out of it in a way
that has seen them labeled as different from their
parent movement. Jakobson still considered his
work to be structuralist, since he ultimately agreed

669
as a movement has not finished, as can be seen
from the preponderance of structural linguists. The
onslaught of deconstruction has had little effect
on the areas traditionally covered by its parent:
the question “Why not?” has to be asked. The
reason may be that the attempt to produce an
objective science of structure gained a great deal
of strength from the moment of its success in the
academy. The very structure of the education
system has soaked up the structuralist challenge
to the extent that the movement permeates so
many disciplines that its effects endure.

`structure
 The sum total of stable connections
of a literary work which provide for its wholeness
and identity with itself, that is, the preservation
of basic qualities without external or internal
changes. Since the Middle Ages the notion of
structure has been used as one of the ways to define
form (form as structure, as the organization of the
content). In the twentieth century, the analysis
of structural relationships and connections
occupied an important place in the analysis of
language, literary and art works, and Culture
in general. In contemporary science, the notion
of structure usually corresponds to notions of
System and organization, which characterize the
entire manifestation of an object (its components,
connections between the elements, their functions,

structure

with the fundamental impetus to objectivity
claimed by the movement. Despite his differences,
in other words, he accepted the basic ideals. Nevertheless, deconstruction and poststructuralism do
not accept the basic ideals, and the institutional
consequences of this denial have been profound.
Structuralism was accepted in academic circles
despite its relative iconoclasm, compared at least
with the religious Humanism of the European and
American academic establishment in the period
of structuralism’s development. The reason for
this acceptance was that, although structuralism
needed no God, it still constituted a form of
humanism. This may at first be considered to be
a strange effect of a movement which, after all,
claimed to be a science. However, the humanism
came in the form of structuralism’s acceptance that
the structure of the human being was at the root
of all of the phenomena it attempted to describe.
Materialist critics denounce this as ahistorical:
deconstructionists see it as a longing after lost presence. Both criticisms point to an area of convergence between structuralism and the humanities
it sought to replace, and it is this which explains
the success of the movement in the academic
institution. The way in which structuralists very
quickly took over the discipline of linguistics and
turned it into a science of structural linguistics is
the prime example of this movement.
Moreover, despite the relatively radical claims
made by poststructuralists, the maneuver made
by structuralism in gaining its own ascendancy is
worth recalling. It may be possible to see poststructuralism as replicating this maneuver, especially with regard specifically to deconstruction.
The reason for this is that it is possible to practice a form of deconstruction which is not in fact
very challenging, at least in its relations with the
literary-philosophical tradition which Derrida
tried to turn on its head. The maneuver of
deconstruction can be made without the politics
of an onslaught on presence. Deconstruction can
be reduced to simply another technique of
literary criticism, one which is spectacular, to be
sure, but nevertheless ultimately one which can
pressed into service on behalf of an academic institution which does not accord with the impetus
of Derrida’s initial moment. This critique has
been leveled at the uses made of deconstruction
in the United States, although it has relevance for
a discussion of structuralism also. Structuralism

etc.). Structure expresses only those elements
which remain stable, relatively unchanging, in
various transformations of the system. Organization includes both the structural and the
dynamic characteristics of the system which
provide for its directed functioning.
An important contribution to the development
of the notion of structure was made by structural
linguistics, the founders of which were Jan
Baudouin de Courtenay and Ferdinand de
Saussure. Structural linguistics aimed at a scientifically precise (almost mathematical) analysis
of language. The starting point of this analysis
was the notion of the structure of language. In
general terms, structure represents the inner
connections lying in the basis of language, which
determine the way readers or listeners directly
perceive the substance or “matter” of language:
the systems of sounds and meanings.
In the 1920s Russian formalism applied the
notion of structure to the literary work as a whole.
By structure they meant the composition of a
literary work, its internal and external organization, the type of connection between its composing
elements. Structure provided for the wholeness of
an art work and its ability to express, to transmit
its content. Russian formalist critics made it
their primary task to study “how a literary work
is made.” The system of devices that comprise a
literary work inevitably led to the work’s structure and the laws of its composition.
Russian formalists and their followers in the
Prague linguistic circle perceived structure as
a special methodological principle of Literary
criticism. No matter how unique the structure
of any concrete literary work is, it inevitably
has some common feature with the principles of
structure of another work of the same genre,
type, and kind of Art. Structure turns out to be
a carrier of not only individually meaningful
formal characteristics of a given art work, but also
of common expressions of genre, type, general
style, the artistic trend of literature in its totality
as an art and as an objectified creative activity.

`structure of feeling 
First used by Raymond
Williams in his A Preface to Film (with Michael
Orrom, 1954), developed in The Long Revolution
(1961), and extended and elaborated throughout
his work, in particular Marxism and Literature
(1977), Williams first used this concept to characterize the lived experience of the quality of life
at a particular time and place. It is, he argued,
“as firm and definite as ‘structure’ suggests, yet it
operates in the most delicate and least tangible part
of our activities.” Later he describes structures of
feeling as “social experiences in solution.” Thus
a “structure of feeling” is the Culture of a particular historical moment, though in developing
the concept, Williams wished to avoid idealist
notions of a “spirit of the age.” It suggests a
common set of perceptions and values shared
by a particular generation, and is most clearly
articulated in particular and artistic forms and
conventions. The industrial novel of the 1840s
would be one example of the structure of feeling
which emerged in middle-class consciousness out
of the development of industrial capitalism. Each
generation lives and produces it own “structure
of feeling,” and while particular groups might
express this most forcibly, it extends unevenly
through the culture as a whole. In later formulations of the concept, however, Williams stresses
“the complex relation of differentiated structures
of feeling to differentiated classes,” and the area
of tension between “Ideology” and “experience.”

`style 
The number and variety of definitions
of “style” are daunting (Bailey and Burton, 1968,
Introduction and pp. 147–53): an honorific
applied to aesthetically pleasing writing, ornament
and embellishment of content, authorial expressiveness, the unity of form and content, verbal
details of diction, imagery, syntax, and sound,
and so on. The rise of Stylistics has encouraged
a definition more susceptible to linguistic use,
particularly focusing on (i) the linguistic features
of Texts (see Dupriez, 1991); and (ii) the patterning of those features. For examples, John
Haynes (1989) treats style as choice, “the study
of distinctions; looking at what was said against
what might have been said” in relation to its
contexts (p. 8). However, style is also “tendencies
in a text, or in a type of text,” the “verbal habits”
or recurrences in a text, an author’s works, or a
genre (and by implication in a historical period
or nation). Haynes uses almost half of his book
in explaining the language as a System in order
to confirm his approach to style.
John Childs (1986) focuses upon the specific
and the patterning choices of the self-referential
Poetry of Pound’s Cantos. But he places his discussion of fragmentation, deletion, condensation, and coupling within linguistic frames of
Langue/parole, norm and deviation, form and
content, of defamiliarization and foregrounding,
that is, within the language system of rules of production (expansion, conversion) which readers
share, in which they are competent. For example,
he shows how the difficult concluding lines of

style

style, international

672
Canto 1 are construable within English-language
sentence structure following the linguistic principles of deletion and condensation (pp. 28–30).
Like Haynes, Childs perceives “a dialectic
between a semantic matrix [shared cultural and
literary conventions] and the transformation of
that matrix into a given text” (p. 26), the linguistic
result of which is explicitly determinable.
Though they conceptualize the whole range of
language from the inherited patterns of genre,
period, and nation to specific choices in drama
or poetry, and their mutual relationships, both
Haynes and Childs emphasize specific texts. The
recent sophistication of quantitative analysis is
making it increasingly possible to describe more
accurately the style of an author, a genre, a period,
and a nation. The fields of reader response and
pragmatics are developing for the study of Discourse and Speech acts, the interaction of
language and its users, texts and contexts – style
as linguistic devices which serve social perspectives and trigger diverse responses (of which
Haynes and Childs are actively aware though
they do not employ the labels).
These developments in the linguistic definition
and analysis of style are not without criticism.
Talbot Taylor (1980) attacks as elusive and unconvincing the explanations of the cause–effect relation between form and meaning underlying the
theories of style offered by a range of linguists
– Jakobson, Riffaterre, the generativists, and
Dillon.

`stylistics
 The movement to be explicit, accurate, and systematic in the study of Texts by the
application of linguistic theories and methods
is called linguistic stylistics or stylistics. Although
the study of texts through linguistics reaches
back to the early years of the twentieth century
and even to classical rhetoric – schemes and
Tropes, historical philology, Slavic formalism,
the New criticism, French stylistique (the French
interest in language has been sustained since the
sixteenth century), German Stilforschung – its
modern organization begins in the 1960s. The
Indiana Conference on Style (1958; edited by
Sebeok, 1960), Milic’s quantitative study of Swift
and his bibliography (1967), the creation of the
journals Style (1967) and Language and Style
(1968), the Bailey–Burton bibliography (1968),
Ohmann’s Shaw (1969), Bailey’s and Dolezel’s
Statistics and Style (1969), collections of essays
edited by Donald Freeman (1970) and Seymour
Chatman (1971), the collection The Computer
and Literary Studies edited by Aitken, Bailey, and
Hamilton-Smith (1973), and Nils Enkvist’s Linguistic Stylistics (1973) are some of the pathfinders
in English. On the Continent: H. Meschonnic, Pour
la Poétique (1970–75), D. Alonso, Pluralità e
correlazione in poesia (1971), and E. Riesel and
E. Schendels, Deutsche Stilistik (1975) illustrate
the extensive early writings there. It was also an
intellectually vigorous time of exploring diverse
idealist and functionalist linguistic models –
transformational grammar, case grammar,
generative semantics, text grammar, Speech-act
theory, and systemic/levels and categories. (The
idealists/formalists, such as Noam Chomsky,
Morris Halle, and Paul Kiparsky, treat grammar
as distinct in principle, language-specific, not
derivable from linguistic behavior; to the functionalists, such as M.A.K. Halliday, Ruquaiya

contextualization, placing the text in search
of collective characteristics or norms:
(a) historical-cultural – the personal,
rhetorical, social, generic, and ideological circumstances; and
(b) linguistic – period, dialect, subject
matter, spoken and written, and
degree of formality;
(ii) detailed description of the language in
search of individual characteristics (deviations from norms):
(a) syntax – hypotaxis and parataxis; and
(b) lexis – collocation, imagery, markers;
(iii) interrelation of parts to whole;
(iv) description of whole;
(v) comparisons with other texts as controls.
Their explanation of the potential precision,
explicitness, and comprehensiveness of their
model, that it provides techniques of description, facts about language and texts, and more
sensitive responses to language and literature,
offered a sketch of the the discipline of stylistics that was to develop in the following years.
For example, The Literary Stylistics of French
(Bellard-Thomason, 1992) in many ways parallels
Spencer and Gregory. They were prescient also in
their recognition of the importance of joining two
or more disciplines in research and teaching, for
this collaboration has become the central feature
of contemporary Cultural studies.
The potential precision, comprehensiveness,
and flexibility of their and other conceptions
of textual analysis were embraced by the journal
Style from its inception and expressed in its annual
bibliography of stylistic studies. Beginning with
its 1979 bibliography this classification became
standard: 1. Bibliographies; 2. General Theory;
3. Culture, History, and Style (period, nation,
genre): 3.1 Theory, 3.2 Practice, 3.2.1 Diction,

Vocabulary, Imagery, Tropes, 3.2.2 Syntax, 3.2.3
Prosody, 3.2.4 Beyond the Sentence and Line:
Discourse, 3.2.5 Studies on Several Linguistic
Levels; 4. Habitual Usage (author) (the same system as above is repeated); 5. Individual Choice
(the text) (again the same system); 6. Individual
Response (the reader) (and again). As the journal
stated at the time, its aim was to “facilitate communication world-wide, by minimizing private
and obscure terminology and methods and by
maximizing connections and relationships.”
This taxonomy allows for studies of small
linguistic details, while reminding critics of the
contexts within which they work. Obversely,
it embraces large generic, national, and cultural
studies, but reminds critics of the discipline of
method and rigor of evidence essential to
credibility.
One of the most optimistic expressions of the
application of linguistics to the study of literature
is Linguistic Perspectives on Literature (Ching et al.,
1980). They perceived in 1980 “a new phase of
linguistic investigation of literature” that would
produce “a revolutionary kind of insight into the
nature of literature, language, and man himself.”
Their thesis is “that the creative principles of
human language are centrally, not peripherally,
located in the semantics and Aesthetics of
human literature and that the ordinary linguistic
competence now being formalized in Language
theory offers powerful and unique perspectives
on the extraordinary imaginative interplay
between writer, text, and reader now dominating
the concerns in literary theory” (p. 4). However,
this idealist project is presented eclectically, each
model valuable in so far as it accomplishes its
descriptive and interpretative goals.
The confidence of such advocates for stylistics
seems confirmed by such books as Language
Crafted (Austin, 1984), but through rigorously
restricted goals. “Literary competence” is set
aside as a separate through allied discipline. “At
best, stylistic evidence may combine with data
from other sources – biographical, historical,
metrical, or ‘new critical’ – to elucidate” meaning.
Austin operates from the fundamental linguistic
assumption, derived from numerous empirical
studies, that the same text produces considerable
agreement about a work among diverse readers,
and that readers share reactions to literary texts
because they share an inventory of techniques,

stylistics

Hasan, and Geoffrey Leech, the structure of
grammar is determined by its use.)
In “An approach to the study of style,”
Spencer and Gregory (1964) offered a holistic
program based upon their belief that the student
of literature “ought to be trained in the study of
both language and literature.” They conceived
the analysis of texts in five steps largely deriving
from the functionalist levels and categories
theories of Halliday:

stylistics

674
a competence for analyzing linguistic and particularly syntactic behavior. He spends a chapter,
for example, explaining deviant syntax in
Poetry (“Anyone lived in a pretty how town”)
within the System of, rather than exceptions to,
the language in which it was written. Thus an
ultimate purpose of stylistic analysis is that of
explaining the relationship between readers’
syntactic competence and their experience of a
text, discovering the means by which language’s
role in shaping that experience is exercised. To
give order to this purpose, he establishes four
standards for a comprehensive theoretical framework which he then applies to literary analysis
(delimit the material to be examined, set forth
a clearly defined model, evaluate the capacity of
the model to analyze texts insightfully, and consider the implications for associated texts and
fields). For example, he shows why the syntax of
Shelley’s Laon and Cythna is not functional and
why that of Adonais is.
While these organizing and stabilizing developments were occurring in stylistics, countercurrents
known by various labels as Structuralism,
Poststructuralism, Reader-response, and
Deconstruction were questioning the assumptions that stylists were making about the determinable nature of texts and readers. Austin meets
the challenges of Jacques Derrida and Stanley
Fish head on by denying the impossibility of
understanding while accepting the impossibility
of certitude. The System of rules underlying
languages and the various particular grammars
chosen for literary analysis presuppose the discoverability of stable, though not necessarily
unitary, meanings for each literary text.
Austin sets forth what in the syntax of a poem
contributes to the meaning of the poem, but the
meaning he recognizes as derived from multiple,
complex contexts. Other stylisticians are exploring agreements and disputes between stylistics
and the expanding and destabilizing theoretical
currents of the 1960s to the 1990s. Discourse
stylistics has been developing with the same
aim of syntactical studies – “to be sufficiently
detailed, explicit and retrievable for other analysts,
working on the same text” (Carter and Simpson,
1989). Nevertheless, these analysts are acutely
aware of the difficulties for a discipline grounded
in linguistics, as contexts, especially nonlinguistic
contexts, are conjoined with linguistic contexts,

when it “becomes difficult to undertake analysis
which is sufficiently principled to promote linguistic descriptive progress” (pp. 14–15).
A conference held in Glasgow (addresses published as The Linguistics of Writing, Fabb et al.,
1987) consciously contrasted itself to the 1958 conference in Indiana, by declaring it “no longer
possible to consider questions about language
and literature without taking into account the
social and political context in which all forms of
discourse operate.” Another difference is the
emphasis upon “Writing,” all kinds of writing,
rather than the traditional literature which the 1958
critics assumed as their Subject. A third is the
conception of writing as unstable and uncertain,
opposed to the idealized certainty and confidence of linguistics. (Some of the contributors
to the book treat linguistics as a form of writing
susceptible to linguistic, literary, historical, and
social scrutiny. For example, one examined
Roman Jakobson’s famous “Closing statement”
in Style in Language in relation to international
political circumstances such as the Cold War.)
The Glasgow conference grappled with the
role of a determinable stylistics in the context of
recent theoretical diversity, indeterminacy, and
doubt. The debate will continue, as linguists
recognize. “Neither the general theory [of language
structure] nor . . . particular grammars are fixed
for all time” (Chomsky); “Disagreement discloses antinomies and tensions within the field
discussed and calls for novel exploration”
(Roman Jakobson in Sebeok).

`subaltern studies
 Contemporary Indian historiography. The Italian activist and Marxist,
Antonio Gramsci, used “subaltern” in his
prison writings of the 1930s to refer to socially
subordinated groups that, by definition, lacked
the unity and organization of those in power.
Borrowing the term in the early 1980s, Marxist
Indian revisionist historiographers use it to refer
to all those “of inferior rank” – a group with even
less formal institutional access to political power
than Gramsci’s European working classes of the
1930s.
Its focus on subaltern groups sharply distinguishes subaltern studies from two dominant
and mutually opposed historiographic traditions
in India: that of European colonizers and Indian
nationalists, who themselves contested the Eurocentrism of the former. Despite this difference,

from the perspective of subaltern studies the
colonial and Indian nationalist approaches share
a middle-class orientation, and a consequent
inability to assign Indian subaltern groups any but
the most secondary roles in history, to see them
as anything but a passive, naive, potentially
anarchic and unstable entity in urgent need of
guidance from above. In its counternarrative of
Indian history, subaltern studies has taken on a
dual task: a study of the gaps and closures of official
Indian nationalist accounts to understand why
nationalism failed to address subalternity; and
the project of recovering archival material,
including forms of popular and non-print culture,
that indicates specific subaltern interventions in
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
The eight volumes of essays published to date
by the collective are marked by an interdisciplinary approach incorporating Cultural studies
as well as the social sciences; and a sustained
reformulation of such Marxist concepts such as
Hegemony and historical periodization in terms
relevant to the Third World.
Recent work by the collective has responded
to the call from Indian feminists, such as Susie
Tharu and Gayatri C. Spivak, that the figure of
the subaltern be gendered and that patriarchal as
well as colonial and class-based oppressions be
examined. A second critique comes also from
Spivak, who identifies herself as a strong admirer
of the project but questions the collective’s occasional essentializing of the subaltern in the effort
to construct its counterhistory. While the larger
question here, about ways of conceptualizing
agency, will no doubt continue to be addressed
as the project continues, the innovativeness and
rigor of subaltern studies has already generated
excitement among postcolonial scholars in India
and elsewhere.

subcultures

676
`subcultures 
The concept refers to the distinctive values and processes of particular groups
within wider cultural and social formations. Subcultural analysis has been particularly important
in work on the variety of postwar youth cultures
and has emphasized the active construction of cultural meanings and spaces by subordinate, often
working-class, groups in various institutional
and everyday contexts.
A curious or concerned or envious interest in
those perceived as not respectable or, in a later
vocabulary, deviant has been part of the work of
novelists, social commentators, journalists, and
others since the beginnings of urban capitalism.
From Mayhew, Dickens, and Booth to Tom
Wolfe there has been detailed commentary upon
patterns of behavior, forms of dress, styles of
music, modes of speech, and much else. Within
the new discipline of sociology there was a notable
series of studies from the Chicago school
exploring a range of marginal groups within the
city, including hobos and youth “gangs,” though
this formulation drew attention to particular
groups rather than broader cultural patterns. A
later trajectory of work in the sociology of deviance
on both sides of the Atlantic argued that dominant groups (including the media, judiciary, and
police) had power to label groups as “deviant”
from preferred norms, with effects upon the ways
in which such groups are signified and understood,
and also live their own identities.
Subcultural studies have treated the activities,
forms, and values which they analyzed as fairly
coherent attempts to make sense of and pursue
strategies within given social locations. In the
1960s and 1970s work was concerned with the
forms of youth cultures and cultural patterns
within education, workplaces, sport, and elsewhere. It reclaimed in a positive light behavior and
attitudes often dismissed as delinquent, abnormal,
or symptomatic of educational failure. Instead
these were studied with empathy and sometimes
as imminently political though in unfamiliar
forms: as ways of coping but also as celebration,
protest, or resistance.
Methodologically the studies varied considerably
while sharing an emphasis on meanings against
a then dominant quantitative Positivism. Sometimes informed by their authors’ own experiences, analyses drew variously upon media and
other usually hostile public accounts; upon

semiological analysis of cultural forms, styles
and languages; and upon participant observation and ethnography. A widely cited article by
Cohen argued that three levels of work were
required: the historical location of the “problematic of a particular class fraction”; structural
and semiotic analysis; phenomenological attention
to ways in which the subculture is lived out.
Others drew attention to the importance of the
age stage in a cultural life cycle. However, the
shared frame of reference has usually been derived
from Marxism in situating subordinate, usually
working-class, groups within dominant social
processes, while also being concerned with the
cultural, “imagined” forms through which their
position was explained, resisted, or (for Willis,
ironically) celebrated.
Cumulatively the work was valuable for a
generation and beyond in its close sympathetic
attention to forms of working-class culture and
the detailed strategies of (mainly male) youth, and
in its registration of struggles not recognized as
such by orthodox social democratic or Marxist
politics. If at present it is less resonant, this is partly
because of the relative fading from visibility of
“youth subcultures” as seen from the 1950s into
the 1980s, due to complex changes in class structure, patterns of employment and unemployment, and in the organization of “leisure”
industries, activities, and spaces.
A variety of problems have been noted in
subcultural analyses. Empirically, the boundaries
and shape of distinctive subcultures are not
easily drawn, and now forms of mixing and
hybridity receive more notice. It is difficult to analyze the complexity of the dominant Cultures
(of society, the “parent” generation of a class
culture, an institution such as a school, sometimes
all of these), within and against which “sub”
cultures mark their presence. There are issues
about both power and method in the analyst’s
close reading of the cul-tural forms of others, and
in the social relations of participant observation
and ethnography. Elements of “resistance” may
have been exaggerated, at times romanticized,
for example in the playing down of aggression
and Racism. Particularly sharp protest has been
registered against the implicit tendency of subcultural frameworks to marginalize Gender and
celebrate Masculinity, writing out the forms of
existence of young women, and also misleadingly

`subject
 The origins of a term which is increasingly used throughout the human sciences
are somewhat obscure, but it is possible to trace
the notion of the subject back to Kant or even
Descartes. In current usage, the term is a reaction against the privileging of the self or the
individual in humanist thought. The concept is
largely the product of the work of Lacan, for
whom the subject is radically distinct fom the ego,
which is viewed as an illusory product of the
Mirror-stage, and Althusser, who employs
it to analyze how human individuals become
subjects, thanks to the imaginary effects of Ideology. The general tendency is to regard the

subject as the effect of a Structure rather than
as its source or origin. The subject does not
speak and is not the origin of meaning; the subject is, rather, spoken by law and Culture. The
signifier is primary, the subject being little more
than a support for the exchange of signifiers. The
very Ambiguity of the term “subject” explains
something of its appeal and productivity. It is both
a grammatical term and a political-legal term (as
in “British subject”); it can be both active (“subject of”) and passive (“subject or subjected to”).
david macey

`subject of the enunciation (also subject of the enounced) 
A pair of terms introduced
by Emile Benveniste, the French linguist and
theoretician of Discourse, whose work has
exerted a profound influence on developments
in poststructuralist thought. This distinction is
best understood if we consider the case of a
first-person reflexive (self-referring) utterance like
Descartes’s cogito, ergo sum (“I think, therefore
I am”). That is to say, the act of thought is such
as to exclude any possible doubt about the present existence of the thinking subject. This
would create a logical contradiction, a failure to
perceive the strict order of necessity that leads from
the indubitable premise (“I think”) to the existential consequent (“I am”). From this minimal
but bedrock certainty one can then proceed,
so Descartes argues, to establish the reality of
an external world proof against all the demons
of skeptical doubt, for instance, the idea that I
might be dreaming when I think myself awake,
or that I might be the victim of some wholesale
illusion perpetrated by a malign demiurge.
Early commentators on Descartes were quick
to point out some of the problems with his
argument in its strong (that is, its purportedly
logicodeductive) form. Thus there is nothing in
the nature of “thinking” per se – no absolute or
privileged link between the cogito and the sum –
that would rule out the substitution of other
(logically equivalent) formulas such as ambulo, ergo
sum (“I walk, therefore I am”). To this it may
perhaps be responded that there is at any rate
a manifest performative Contradiction – a
linguistic or discursive impossibility – in my
uttering (or thinking) the phrase “I think” while
denying that there exists (or can be known to exist)

subject of the enunciation (also subject of the enounced)

overlooking the existence and centrality of relatively conventional, less spectacular behavior. All
these issues, in conjunction with the erosion or
complex qualification of a Marxist framework
through an address to issues of gender and
“Race” have tended to reposition what was once
the centrality of subcultural analysis within
sociology, work on education, consumption, and
music, and in the emerging field of Cultural
studies. However, the main assertion of this
work, that groups which are made to appear
marginal or unsuccessful make their own sense
of the worlds in which they live, through various
cultural forms within complex relations of
power, remains extremely important in different
kinds of study (for instance, media audiences).
Attention to the cultural forms and processes of
many other (for example, most middle-class)
groups remains absent from most current work,
though less so now in the related sphere of
documentary representation.

superstructure

678
any “I” that is simultaneously engaged in that
same act of thought. This is where Benveniste’s
distinction enters to complicate the picture yet further. According to him the Cartesian argument
fails, along with its performative (Speech-act)
variant, as a result of the slippage that occurs
between the two orders of enunciative modality
in its original formulation. Simply put, the
Subject who says “I think” is not to be confused
with the subject whose existence is posited in that
same act of thought. Thus the surface plausibility of Descartes’s claim requires that we ignore the
underlying structure – the linguistic, discursive,
or logico-grammatical form – which emerges on
closer inspection, for this allows of no such
confident appeal to the unitary, self-possessed
subject of knowledge and truth. Rather it confronts
us with the sheer impossibility that thought should
ever coincide with itself (or the cogito attain a lucid
awareness of its own indubitable being) in a
moment of pure, unmediated access beyond all
the vagaries of language and representation. It is
precisely within language – or “discourse,” in
Benveniste’s specific usage of that term – that we
perceive this ineluctable gap that opens up
between the “subject of the enunciation” and the
“subject of the enounced.”
Hence Benveniste’s theory has a great attraction for those in the poststructuralist camp who
proclaim the demise of the Cartesian “subjectpresumed-to-know,” along with the entire
post-Cartesian tradition of epistemological (or
“foundationalist”) thought. This argument
receives its most extreme, often obscure and
riddling, formulations in the work of the French
psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. His avowed purpose is to rescue Freud’s discovery of the
Unconscious from its various déformations
professionelles at the hands of ego psychologists
and other such perverters of the Freudian truth.
Thus Lacan offers his own rewriting of
Descartes’s original dictum: no longer cogito,
ergo sum but cogito, ergo sum ubi cogito, ibi nonsum (“where I think ‘I think, therefore I am,’ that
is just where I am not”). By this and other pieces
of cryptic wordplay Lacan seeks to remind us that
the ego is not master in its own house; that the
unconscious is (very literally) “structured like
a language”; and moreover, that Freud’s “royal
road” to a knowledge of the unconcious and its
effects lay through the region of puns, jokes,

Ambiguities, Parapraxes (slips of the tongue),
and other such mazy detours of the signifier. The
“I” is nothing more than an epiphenomenon of
discourse, a Deictic (or pronominal Shifter)
which marks the subject’s insertion into an
order – that of the Lacanian Symbolic – whose
workings elude the utmost powers of conscious
or reflective grasp. Thus psychoanalysts who
persist vainly in the quest for self-knowledge on
their patients’ (or indeed their own) part are
thereby shown up as unwitting dupes of an
illusory desire whose origin lies in the Cartesian
obsession with “clear and distinct ideas.” It is, to
say the least, a singular Irony that Benveniste’s
elegant and finely honed distinction should be
taken up, via Lacan, into a poststructuralist discourse that on principle finds no room for such
virtues.

A strategy for the

Althusser (Althusser and Balibar, 1965, Part I),
and based upon the Freudian analyst’s technique
for uncovering the “latent content” behind the
“manifest content” of dreams and Parapraxes.
According to Althusser, Texts are governed by
their “problematic,” which determines not only
the questions posed and the answers given, but
also the problems omitted by them. Given that
this theoretical “Unconscious” is present in, yet
absent from, any particular segment of the text,
only a symptomatic reading can (re)construct
it. The Althusserian model was adapted and
developed for the reading of fictional texts by

`synchrony/diachrony 
A Binary opposition
utilized by Ferdinand de Saussure to denote
two different methods of describing time relationships in language analysis. In his case, the
structural linguistics he devised privileged a synchronic approach over a diachronic one. That is,
he viewed the state of a language as it existed at
a single moment in its history rather than in
terms of its development over a period of time.
Saussure’s synchronic approach allowed him to
view the internal relations which constituted a
language, and the theory he produced from this
position is generally regarded as the first truly
structuralist analysis.

`syntagmatic/paradigmatic 
A Binary opposition introduced by Ferdinand de
Saussure to denote two relations in language.
A syntagmatic analysis pays attention to the ways
in which the words used in a particular sentence
relate to one another. A paradigmatic analysis
is concerned with the way that such vocabulary
relates to other words which could have been used
but were not. The paradigmatic associations are
present by default, as it were, and are Saussure’s
way of dealing with the concept of connotative
associations. The opposition between the two
methods is laid open by Derrida (1976) in his
Deconstruction of Saussurean linguistics.

“System” was viewed as a hierarchical set of interdependent variables which exists in dynamic
integration, changing all the time. An individual
work of Art was considered a system of the first

or a historical period, which in turn was a variable in the ultimate cultural system of systems.

`television 
Much of present-day television analysis emerges from the initial work of Raymond
Williams and Marshall McLuhan. Williams’s
Television: Technology and Cultural Form (1974)
places the emergence of television as an invention
of applied technology within the context of larger
societal and economic transformations in the West.
By historicizing television as well as questioning the social effects of programming, Williams
creates a framework and vocabulary from which
to examine television and its programs.
One of Williams’s most influential ideas is
that television is experiencing “a significant shift
from the concept of sequence as programming
to the concept of sequence of flow” (p. 89) where
textual material constantly moves from one image
to the next. This sequential description of “flow”
continues to be an important way to discuss
television, especially in the age of MTV, CNN,
and the Home Shopping Network, where images
are increasingly “detextualized.”
John Ellis (1982) problematizes Williams’s
notion of “flow,” preferring to discuss television’s
tendency for “segmentation.” Ellis argues that television programming presents “rapid alternation
between scenes . . . rather than any sustained progression” (p. 120), presenting “segments in larger
or smaller conglomerations” of images (p. 122).
For Ellis, the narrative of television is a matter of
succession rather than consequence. Williams’s
idea of “flow” is also echoed in Neil Postman’s
(1994) statement that “television is a worldview
without the word ‘because’ in it . . . [with] no
beginning . . . [and] no end”; instead, it is “all
‘ands’ ” (pp. 68–9). Though both Postman and
Ellis challenge and expand Williams’s idea, his
framework remains vital in their discussion of
television.
McLuhan’s controversial Understanding Media
(1964) also discusses media as part of a larger
cultural and societal change. McLuhan views the
prominence of various forms of media as a shift
toward the “cool” abstract and impersonal values
created by the media over the “hot” passionate
and egocentric values of print. He sees society

returning to an emphasis on the privileging of
the spoken word over the written. McLuhan’s
incorporation of television into this oral tradition
is problematic since television is not solely an
audio experience, and in later work he attempted
to further examine and expand his incorporation
of television into such a framework. McLuhan’s
conceptions of television produced critical responses, but was, overall, not as influential as
Williams in this area.
During the 1980s and 1990s television studies
have been greatly influenced by the development
of diverse strands of literary theory. Contemporary
criticism, represented by a variety of approaches
such as Semiotics, Reader-response, Feminist,
Marxist, Deconstruction, and Psychoanalytic, has provided a further framework
from which to examine television. By placing
television and its representations of Culture
in a textual vocabulary, it has allowed television
to be seen as a site for “serious” academic investigation, while still highlighting the differences
between a television program, a piece of literature,
and a film. Robert C. Allen’s (1992) Channels
of Discourse collects an interesting overview
of essays examining television from a variety of
contemporary critical approaches. More specifically, Gregory Ulmer (1989) utilizes Derrida’s
Grammatology to situate current academic
Discourse in the age of television, while John
Fiske (1987) adopts a “viewer-centered” approach
to examine how television can promote “oppositional cultural capital.”
The influence of contemporary criticism has also
allowed a broader examination of how television
represents those on the “margins,” especially
women, people of color, and homo/bisexuals.
Feminist television criticism has addressed the
representation of women on television as well as
broader questions concerning the construction
of Gender and sexuality in the media. Helen
Baehr and Gillian Dyer’s Boxed In: Women And
Television (1987) examines primarily British television culture, focusing on how it is used in the
production of dominant images of women and
how various programs can both negate the challenges of feminism as well as offer opposition to
the dominance of Patriarchy. Elayne Rapping
(1994) offers a varied look at the portrayal of
women in various American media, especially
television programs aimed primarily at women.

In terms of Race, there has not been as much
written as perhaps there should be. Issues concerning the televisual representations of race are
increasingly foregrounded as television in the
West attempts a more “multicultural” perspective
and in the postcolonial world at large the divisions between nations become blurred. Prabha
Krishman and Anita Dighe (1990) look at the
portrayal of women on Indian television where
discourses of colonialism become intertwined
with issues of gender. Linda K. Fuller (1992), Sut
Jhally and Justin Lewis (1992), and Henry Louis
Gates (1989) have all written about the immensely
popular American program The Cosby Show,
examining the global ramifications of an affluent
black sitcom family becoming a quintessential
role model. Amelia Simpson’s Xuxa (1993) specifically addresses the Brazilian television icon,
Xuxa, and her children’s program, which Simpson
argues privileges certain ideas of beauty which are
racially coded.
The emerging field of queer studies has just
begun to examine television. One such study is
Alexander Doty’s Making Things Perfectly Queer
(1993); he undertakes the task of revealing the
implicit “queerness” of mass culture as a means
of confronting the dominant discourses of homophobia and heterosexism present in television.
With the popularity of the rubric of Postmodernism in the academy, some critics have explored
television’s relation to this cultural condition.
Jim Collins’s essay in the revised edition of
Channels of Discourse (Allen, 1992) places television in the larger framework of postmodern
Aesthetics, using David Lynch’s Twin Peaks
as the “cultural phenomenon that epitomizes the
multiple dimensions of televisual postmodernism”
(p. 341). Andrew Goodwin (1992) attempts a
postmodern analysis of MTV, utilizing a historical materialist standpoint to engage in the
politics and Ideology embodied in the images
of music television. Many of the leading postmodern theorists, such as Fredric Jameson and
Jean Baudrillard, also address the role of media
images in the emergence of a postmodern world
view.
Much of the work on television discussed above
falls under the heading of Cultural studies.
In relation to television, cultural studies have
been critical in developing the interdisciplinary
approach required to theorize television within

Popular culture. However, David Morley
(1992) critiques the work of cultural studies on
television as being solely humanities and arts-based
and not interdisciplinary enough. Despite acknowledgements that television cannot be reduced to
a textual phenomenon, Morley feels that most
studies remain “text-centric.”
Though such a critique is valid in some respects,
writers such as Fiske are attempting to negotiate
television in relation to the “Tension” existing
between “institutions, offices, agencies, academics
. . . nations, races [and] genders” (p. 6) which
Morley feels is crucial for adequate theorization.
A text such as Douglas Kellner’s Television and the
Crisis of Democracy (1990) specifically attempts
what Morley suggests. Kellner situates television
within the institutional and systemic framework
of present-day US culture, expanding upon the
work of such theorists as Max Horkheimer and
Theodor Adorno.
The works addressed in this entry reveal only
a minority of the work which has been undertaken
on the subject of television. However, perhaps the
most valuable aspect of an entry such as this one
is that it reveals the work which remains. Issues
of race, Class, and gender, and their representations in television, must continue to be theorized
and criticisms such as Morley’s must be noted as
we continue our studies in television and media.

`tension
 A term used by Allen Tate to denote
the coexistence in Poetry of “extension” (literal
meaning) and “intension” (metaphorical meaning). (Compare Connotation /denotation.)
More broadly, it was used in New Criticism to
describe the pattern of structured conflict or
resolved contradictions (for example, “between the
formality of the rhythm and the informality of
the language” (R.P. Warren), or between the
abstract and the concrete) which the New Critics
regarded as the essential characteristic of the best
poetry.

`text 
In one sense “text” is simply a neutral term
for any cultural object of investigation, whether
a piece of Writing, a ritual activity, a City, or
a mode of knowledge. Thus in literary theory
“text” is commonly used in place of such generic
designations as “lyric” or “novel” in order to
leave open the question of whether what is
being examined is generically specifiable. Virginia

Woolf’s The Waves, for example, sets out to
confound the distinction between the lyric and
the novel; and Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale is
simultaneously (perhaps deliberately) a tragedy,
a comedy, and a romance. Similarly, LéviStrauss’s Tristes tropiques employs novelistic
techniques even though it is ostensibly an anthropological text. In other uses of the term, however,
“text” can be not at all innocent but heavily
loaded with meaning. Although Derrida’s
infamous remark that “There is nothing outside
the text” (1967a (1976), p. 227) has been mistaken
as a denial that there is anything other than
language, even its more credible interpretation –
that if one tries to go to Rousseau’s biography
in order to understand something that he has
written, one is still dealing with written records
of his life that were mostly written by him – still,
the claim has far-reaching implications. For
Kristeva (1974a (1984), pp. 99–106) texts are
generated by complex psychosocial-biological
processes that allow meaning first to be constituted and then disrupted or exceeded, by
materiality, for example, which is initially (for her)
outside meaning.

`Textual Practice 
When Terence Hawkes
from the University of Wales at Cardiff, along with
an international editorial board, set out to produce the first volume of Textual Practice, he was
wary about its future. Hawkes’s introductory
editorial begins with the disclaimer that, while there
is never any good time to start a new journal,
1987 seemed an especially gloomy year for such
purposes, for “the academic world in general
feels itself to be under attack.” And yet, Hawkes
concluded his remarks with the assertion that
“there was never a time when [a journal] such
as Textual Practice was more necessary.”
The journal, which focuses primarily on
literary Texts, while managing to keep sight of
the broader study of textuality across disciplines,
serves its purpose well. The role of Textual
Practice has proven to be one of both the observer

and the active participant, challenging existing
Structures in textual criticism; the articles in the
journal are by and about major critics of the day.
The lead article in the first issue, for instance is
“The end of English,” by Terry Eagleton; the
focus of the essay, in which he dwells on the effect
of the influential journal Scrutiny, is the struggle
between the study of “English” as a subject and
Critical theory, which sparks the interest of
today’s scholars. Eagleton ends with the claim that
“the only conflict which finally matters is between
the internationalism of late capitalist consumerism,
and the internationalism of its political antagonist.” The article, besides being reminiscent of
some of Hawkes’s earlier writings, is an appropriate lead into Textual Practice; this same sort
of concern for literature and its relation to other
textual forms recurs in each volume.
Textual Practice is now published by Routledge
three times each year; articles and reviews makes
up the bulk of these issues, although the occasional
letter makes its way into the journal. Periodically,
the journal strays slightly from its typical form
to incorporate a special project; once, in 1991,
it published a bibliography of Derrida’s works
between 1962 and 1990. In 1988 Textual Practice
devoted four articles to a study of Donald
Davidson’s work, including a piece by Christopher Norris, Hawkes’s colleague at the University of Wales at Cardiff, who serves as review
editor and frequent contributor. Two years later
it devoted an entire issue (with the exception of
a few reviews) to the exploration of lesbian and
gay cultures, for which Joseph Bristow served as
guest editor.
Despite Hawkes’s forecasts, Textual Practice
has provided lively academic Discourse on the
movements in literary theory and other related
fields. Textual Practice was not “self-evidently
doomed” from the start, as Hawkes wrote in
those early pages; rather, it has helped set the pace
for textual studies.

`theater 
For the greater part of the twentieth
century, Anglo-European theories of drama and
performance were associated with several questions of mostly Aristotelian derivation: whether
the primary function of drama should be to delight
or to instruct; to what extent drama truly holds

“the mirror up to nature;” whether the essence
of drama lies in the “Text” or in the performance;
whether it is possible to achieve a “total theater”
in which the constituent elements of character,
Plot, music, gesture, and spectacle are inseparable; whether such key Aristotelian concepts as
catharsis or hamartia are relevant to modern
tragedy, or, for that matter, whether the received
generic and structural categories – tragedy,
comedy, climax, dénouement, and so forth – are
relevant to the study of any drama, modern or
otherwise.
Dramatic theory during the last decades of the
twentieth century variously adopted, interrogated,
and reformulated this inheritance. It sought to
reevaluate received theater history without focusing merely on the periods traditionally centered
by scholars and practitioners, the ancient Greek,
the European Renaissance, and the European
Modern. Because new research into theater historiography has challenged and reconfigured the
received criteria for determining artistic “value,”
scholars have become at once more cautious and
more open in designating what might qualify as
the “significant” theatrical activity of particular
periods. As a consequence of this recent openness
concerning the range and constitution of performance art, increasing attention has been turned
toward forms once ignored (popular and folk arts,
regional and amateur theaters); toward types
of performance or “symbolic action” (Clifford
Geertz) which have not traditionally been examined by students of theater; toward the conditions
and social contexts of theatrical production; and
toward the ideological underpinnings of performing texts.
As a result, contemporary theater studies have
cumulatively produced not only impressive theoretical discussions of stagecraft but also, more
important, a complex critical apparatus capable
of decoding all “symbolic action” and thus of intervening in what is thought of as the contemporary,
postmodernist crisis of spectacle and representation. It should be noted that, in spite of this
diversification, and in spite of several decades of
intensive study of non-Western arts (as opposed,
that is, to non-Western critical traditions), AngloEuropean studies occupy a hegemonic position in
dramatic theory as it is practiced today.
Before reviewing the most recent trends in
dramatic theory and criticism, it is necessary to

685
debates of the century; whose names are often
unknown to the public at large even when their
work has been adapted and assimilated into
Popular Culture; and whose work is, in spite of
such obscurity, somewhat capable of generating
institutional sponsorship. To name only the most
obvious: Henrik Ibsen; August Strindberg; Anton
Chekhov; Konstantin Stanislavsky; Vsevolod
Meyerhold; Vladimir Mayakovsky; Edward
Gordon Craig; John Millington Synge; George
Bernard Shaw; Antonin Artaud; Jean Anouilh;
Friedrich Dürrenmatt; Stanislaw Witkiewicz;
Erwin Piscator; Bertolt Brecht; Jean Genet; Luigi
Pirandello; Sean O’Casey; Eugene Ionesco;
Samuel Beckett; Harold Pinter; Brendan Behan;
Augusto Boal; Dario Fo; Jerzy Grotowski; Peter
Brook – a list of notables which draws attention
to the relentless if unsurprising eurocentrism and
male orientation of dramatic theory and practice.
Virtually every artist deemed worthy of inclusion in this canon has been preoccupied with the
question of Modernity and has advocated the
development of a theatrical aesthetic appropriate to a postindustrial age, to what Walter
Benjamin described as “the age of mechanical
reproduction.” Their experimentation with theatrical form has generated a complex of discussions
concerning all aspects of theatrical creativity and
production: “authorship;” spectatorship; genre;
language; silence and articulation; gesture; space;
design; cultural politics; philosophies and techniques of acting; and, centrally, Aesthetics and
Ideology. (See Bentley, 1968 and Carlson, 1984.
Also, for a critique of the ways in which the idea
of the avant-garde is privileged in theatre historiography, see Alan Woods’s essay in Postlewait
and McConachie, 1989.)
However, the range of theatrical activity practiced globally today far exceeds what is visible
in the West on financially competitive stages
or those which are supported by the cultural
apparatuses of the state. Theaters in most parts
of the world function not only in such “official,”
economically protected spaces, but also, and
more frequently, in informal or underground
sites, often without budgets or formal stages and
often at enormous political risk. Grass-roots
“people’s theater” groups, which have always
flourished by the thousand all over the world, provide powerful examples of oppositional cultural
politics in action, and, in their contemporary

theater

consider the state of contemporary performance
art itself. Contemporary Western criticism is in
many ways a response to the crisis of survival
confronting the theater in an age in which
cultural production has been overwhelmingly
technologized and commodified. As television,
film, and video technology drive the theater into
increasingly marginal and inadequately funded
performance spaces, even commercial stages
have struggled to survive the onslaught of mass
communication. Oddly enough, in spite of over
a century of experimentation with theatrical space
and dramatic technique, much theater practiced
commercially today in the West seems conventionally designed for a proscenium stage, using
more or less realistic characterization, dialogue,
and plot. Such apparent devotion to convention
may be seen as a defensive strategy which enables
the commercial theater to maintain the kind of
permanence available to extinct or rare species:
by adopting the role of a performing museum,
the theater participates in the commodification
of nostalgia and thereby earns at least a fraction
of the income generated by dinosaurs or the
colonial fashion industry. Opera and contemporary musicals, for example, are able (especially
when performed in “restored” prewar theaters) to
compete in the open market with music television; ticket prices for popular musicals and
rock concerts are roughly comparable. To a lesser
extent, folk theaters and revivals of “classics”
(such as Greek tragedies or Ibsen) are able to claim
various forms of institutional subsidy in their
capacity as repositories of Western heritage. Consider the continuing popularity of Shakespeare,
which, albeit tenuous, generates income sufficient enough to allow Shakespearean companies
to experiment occasionally, and even, once in a
while, to stage new plays.
It is useful to distinguish “commercial” theater
from the “Avant-garde” performance art of
critically acclaimed artists, whose work is seen
to challenge the “official,” commercial theater
at the same time that it enjoys another kind of
“official” sanction and approbation, that granted
by critics, scholars, and funding organizations. To
some extent, the established Canon of modern
theater consists of artists who form a kind of
official underground; whose work is recognized
to have influenced that of other artists and to have
contributed to the acknowledged theoretical

theater

686
form, also of postindustrial, anti-consumer society
aesthetics. Operating outside and against the
established structures of power in the societies
they inhabit, such groups participate at several
levels in struggles for cultural and political
emancipation and self-determination: revivals
of local arts, customs, histories, and languages, as
well as economic and political organizing against
poverty, racial and sexual oppression, and other
violations of human rights.
Collectively, “people’s theater” groups constitute
an international movement in performance arts
which is comparable in aesthetic scope to film and
considerably more effective as political activism.
The International Popular Theatre Alliance was
formed during the 1980s to create a network
among such groups and to draw critical attention
to their work. The Alliance focused specifically on “Third World” theaters, but it is clear
that underground theaters perform everywhere;
indeed, many influential artists of the official
Western canon (Meyerhold, Mayakovsky, Brecht,
Piscator) drew upon the work of grass-roots
groups to develop theories of political theater.
Among several projects which have in recent
years earned international recognition are the
Kamiriithu Community Educational and Cultural
Centre of Kenya; the early work of Václav Havel
in the former Czechoslovakia; the Jamaican Sistren
Collective; John McGrath’s 7:84 theater company in England and Scotland; the Jana Natya
Manch in India; the Philippines Educational
Theater Association; and, in the United States,
El Teatro Campesino, Teatro de la Esperanza, and
the San Francisco Mime Troupe (see van Erven,
1988 and 1992).
Grass-roots political theaters share with the
“official” avant-garde described above a critical
attitude towards contemporary Culture; both
seek, in playwright Howard Brenton’s words,
to “disrupt the spectacle” of modern life and to
expose its many cultural contradictions. Because
such theaters so often function without official
sponsorship, and because, as Benjamin has argued,
they tend to assimilate or “enter into debate”
with newer artistic forms and with contemporaneity at large, experimental theaters (whether
in the official or invisible underground) may be
especially capable of withstanding the technological age, perhaps even of protecting theater
from extinction. Both draw upon a vast variety

of performance techniques, including agitational
propaganda, slogan art, cartooning, acrobatics
and juggling, cabaret, puppetry and mask, male
and female impersonation, and dance. Unsurprisingly, the artistic flexibility and inventiveness
of such groups have reconfigured the collapsing
boundaries between art, political activism, and
entertainment.
In the West, alternative and oppositional theaters have often operated in a shifting middle
ground between the underground, avant-garde,
and commerce. The activist movements of the
1960s and 1970s – protests against war, capitalism,
and imperialism; agitation for racial and sexual
emancipation – encouraged the emergence of
new playwrights as well as the development of
politically specific collectives. In the United States
and Britain, several New Left theaters proliferated during these decades, initially staging
agitational propaganda and consciousness-raising
plays in small venues and later moving to bigger
stages. African-American, feminist, and gay theaters have been especially prolific and innovative,
not only remapping the boundaries between
“high” and Popular culture but also shaping
– as the recent increase in published collections
of plays testifies – what should become the canon
of late twentieth-century drama in English.
Since the mid-1980s, black British, Chicana/o,
Native American, and Asian American artists
and groups have begun to attract belated critical
notice. To name, once again, only the best known
of the interventionist playwrights and companies to emerge in the postwar era: Lorraine
Hansberry; Amiri Baraka; Ed Bullins; Adrienne
Kennedy; August Wilson; Ntozake Shange; Anna
Deavere Smith; the Negro Ensemble Company;
the Free Southern Theatre; Caryl Churchill;
Pam Gems; the Omaha Magic Theater; the
Spiderwoman Theater Workshop; Monstrous
Regiment; Harvey Fierstein; Martin Sherman;
Joe Orton; Split Britches; WOW Cafe; Theatre
Rhinoceros; Gay Sweatshop; Mustapha Matura;
Caryl Phillips; Benjamin Zephaniah; Jacqueline
Rudet; Hanif Khureishi; Hanay Geiogamah; the
Native American Theatre Ensemble; Luis Valdez;
Jorge Huerta; National Teatros of Aztlán; Frank
Chin; the Theatre for Asian American Performing Artists.
Contemporary critical interest in oppositional
Discourse and theater has been stimulated in

687
array of questions concerning the politics of
race, Class, gender, and sexuality posed by
transatlantic Cultural studies: the materialities
of cultural production and more generally of
Signifying practices; the possibility of oppositional
discourse in an era of mass media and Consumer culture; the “imagined communities”
of nation, race, ethnicity; the condition of
Liminality and border-crossing; the positionalities of power, oppression, and resistance (see
Reinelt and Case, 1991; Reinelt and Roach, 1992;
Postlewait and McConachie, 1989; and Case,
1990). Theorists as well as practitioners of AfricanAmerican performance arts have produced not
only comprehensive and influential studies of
the origins and development of black theater
and performative aesthetics, but also, until the
1990s, the only systematic theorizing of ethnicity
and race (see Harrison, 1972; Hill, 1980; Fabre,
1983; essays by Sandra Richards in Reinelt and
Roach, 1992, and by James V. Hatch in Postlewait and McConachie, 1989). Studies of feminism and theater have contributed to the study
of theater history and historiography, radicalizing analysis of the semiotics of performance, the
aesthetics of oppositional cultural production,
and the analysis of body politics (see Case, 1990;
Austin, 1990; Dolan, 1991). Studies of gay and lesbian theaters, and gay and lesbian performance
art itself, have extended the feminist interrogation of sexuality and cultural politics, effectively
redefining the scope of what constitutes performative action (see especially Dolan, 1991; and
Case, 1990).
Anthropologically oriented discussions of
performance rituals, developed most notably by
Richard Schechner, have contributed to general
understanding of the central role of theater and
performance in cultural self-constitution, and
have also influenced specific ethnographic studies
of non-Western performance arts. Although
this has led to some Western dabbling in nonWestern theaters, both internationalism and
interculturalism remain inadequately theorized (see
Marranca and Dasgupta, 1991; and Schechner,
1985). The twentieth-century avant-garde has,
of course, frequently turned to the non-West;
many approaches to non-Western performance
art are derived from modernist interests in
primitivism. Artaud, for example, looked to the
Orient for a means to enslave spectators with the

theater

large measure by the challenge posed by underground and avant-garde groups. A new generation
of political criticism has engaged the racial and
sexual politics of theater history and performance texts, and has drawn upon the work of
International Situationism, with its analysis of
the “society of the spectacle,” to explore the
performance of cultural opposition in society
at large. These and other interests have been theorized and extensively developed, particularly in
the United States, where studies of Renaissance
theater initially played a key role in redefining the
terrain of dramatic criticism (see Renaissance
studies). During the 1980s theater studies were
substantially transformed following the publication of controversial discussions of Critical
theory and performance. Recent theorists have
drawn upon several interpretative methodologies, including Semiotics, Deconstruction,
Psychoanalytic criticism, and Phenomenology. Semiotic and structuralist theory have
provided theater criticism with a means to
analyze performance as an encoded System of
shifting Signs in which the various elements
of the performance, including the audience, are
brought into a continual play of transformational
possibilities. Deconstruction has further enabled
analysis of the means by which theater continually dismantles its own systems of signification
in a play of shifting subjectivities and unstable signs
which undermines the performance’s claims
to represent reality. Discussions of the politics
of realism and deconstruction in postmodernist
theaters have especially engaged theorists of Race
and Gender. Psychoanalytic theory has been
widely influential in feminist theater criticism,
particularly in post-Lacanian considerations of
spectatorship. (For over-views, see Reinelt and
Roach, 1992, and Carlson, 1984. For specific discussions, consult Elam, 1980, and Pavis, 1983,
on semiotics; Austin, 1990, and Case, 1990, on
deconstruction, psychoanalytic theory, and feminist performance studies; and Wilshire, 1982, and
States, 1985, on phenomenology and theater.)
New research into theater history has been
particularly important in completing the theatrical record and enabling the emergence of
buried voices (see Postlewait and McConachie,
1989). Some of the most complex and provocative
studies have been developed by those scholars
and practitioners who have engaged the vast

theories, language

688
inner truths of their own “erotic obsessions,”
“savagery,” and “even . . . cannibalism.” However, theater professionals and critics often seem
unaware, even in this day and age, of the problematic racialism of discourses which seek in
the non-West a means of psychic self-realization
through Ritual (the implicit contrast being
between the purported inability of Western industrialism to articulate the spiritual or psychic and
the purported expertise of the Orient in matters
immaterial).
Such a legacy will have to be thoroughly reviewed and problematized before theater studies
can begin to theorize anew questions of race and
nation. In spite of the challenges posed by black
and postcolonial cultural theory and many oppositional theaters, and in spite of the manifold
successes of theater historians in recovering
performance histories marginalized by institutionalized racism, theorists of drama and performance have not responded with any vigor to
questions of race, ethnicity, or cultural nationalism. However, with the emergence of new artists
and groups which challenge the presumed stability of such categories as West or non-West, it
becomes increasingly evident that the performance
of Hybridity and interculturalism will concern
scholars for many years to come.

`totemism 
A term that classifies together a
number of different phenomena. In its widest
sense, it refers to a population divided into
groups, each of which is associated with a class
of animate or inanimate objects (its totem). The
term may refer to simple heraldic Symbolism
or to complex Systems of religious and magical
observances. The totem has variously been seen
as a social emblem which represents and maintains the solidarity and continuity of the social
group, or as a means of conceptualizing the
natural, animal world in terms of the social world,
the diversity of species constituting a conceptual
support for social differentiation.

`tragedy 
Chaucer’s definition of tragedy as
a certain storie,
As olde books maken us memorie,
of hym that stood in great prosperitee,
And is yfallen out of high degree,
Into myserie, and endeth wrecchedly

echoes Aristotle’s “virtuous man brought from
prosperity to adversity,” although Chaucer’s definition omits the moral dimension that was crucial
to Aristotle. Aristotle, whose theory, modeled on
Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex, remained the normative
standard for the aesthetic assessment of tragedy

from the late Middle Ages through the eighteenth
century, favors “an air of design” in what brings
about the suffering and fall of the tragic protagonist. The most important part of tragedy
for Aristotle is thus, perhaps surprisingly, not
the character but the Plot, for in this way the
dialectic between fate and the character’s doomed,
if dignified, responses can be dramatized. Structured by a beginning, middle, and end, and
complicated by a reversal or peripeteia, the plot
aims to effect in the audience – to allay Plato’s
fears of immoral provocation – a vicarious
emotional discharge, a catharsis of pity and fear.
Aristotle’s moral and aesthetic stipulation that
tragedy be “serious, complete, and of a certain
magnitude” assigns tragedy the affirmative
existential and political function of asserting the
unexpendable value of the individual in society.
Although contestatory and revisionary, tragedy
confirms the solidity of existing orders precisely
through subjecting them to, and then resolving,
a crisis, while comedy perhaps more than tragedy
points out the fragile nature of social connections
and individual identity.
All extant tragedies of the fifth century (with
the exception of Aeschylus’s Persians), are based
on antecedent, mostly orally transmitted legends
and myths. These, as Richard Sewall has argued,
may be conceived as responses to “the original
un-reason, the terror of the irrational” and to “the
irreducible facts of suffering and death.” The
chorus in classical tragedy echoes the Ritual
festivals and religious cults in Greek cities performed to honor Dionysos, the god of the death
and rebirth of the cycles of life, or as Nietzsche
saw it, the “procreative lust” of the “life force.”
To Nietzsche, whose Birth of Tragedy remains one
of the most original and influential interpretations
of the genre, “all the famous characters of the
Greek stage, Prometheus, Oedipus, etc., are only
masks of the original hero.” The steady diminishment of size and function of the choral parts
from Aeschylus to Euripides announces not only
the death of tragedy, as Nietzsche argued, but also
its diminishing religious significance.
Aeschylus, the oldest known tragedian, is generally considered the most religious. His tragic plot
is set in motion by primeval forces of darkly
uncertain intent. Each character’s desire in The
Oresteia “to check the curse cried on the house
of Atreus” only perpetuates the curse itself, and

author, in enormous detail, within the social
world and political traditions of his time.

the characters remain caught in an inescapable
net. In Aeschylus’s successor Sophocles, the tragic
flaw is more individualized; tragic necessity
becomes, as Freud later claimed with famous
reference to Oedipus, a psychological destiny
inscribed in humankind from earliest childhood.
Unlike Orestes in Aeschylus, who subjects his
will to cosmic powers, Sophocles’ Oedipus displays
a temporary, if illusory, independence, for not
only does he survive the curse of the gods, but
with his self-punishment, he wrests out of the
hands of fate, as it were, his own individual
guilt and responsibility. In Euripides, the third of
the three classical tragedians, the cosmic frame
is either entirely absent, or itself, as Lionel Abel
has pointed out, in catastrophic disarray. Such a
development of tragedy from religious cosmology
to irony is traceable both in the classical canon
itself and in the development of tragedy from
Aeschylus to Arthur Miller or from Agamemnon
to Willy Loman.
Although the protagonists of tragedy reflect
their respective political and social structures –
depicting as they do either the death of a king or
the death of a salesman – the one constant of the
tragic experience seems to be a kind of suffering
that the protagonist and the audience experience
as being in discord with a just universe and
disproportionate to the protagonist’s inevitable
flaws. According to James Joyce, in a famous
passage from Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man, tragic suffering thus inspires pity through
the sense of a shared humanity, while “the secret
cause” inspires fear. The two contrary emotions
may account for the fact, as Adrian Poole points
out, that “the experiences which tragedies represent are such as at one and the same time most
urgently demand and resist explanation.” No
tragic theory since Aristotle has resolved this
conundrum. Hence Terry Eagleton’s comment
on the psychoanalytic and moral implications
of catharsis as a “coming to pity what we fear,”
which points beyond idealized aesthetic insight,
insisting that cathartic recognition be precisely
not aesthetically containable but that it reveal
“the terrifyingly inhuman installed at the core of
the other and oneself.”
Although such larger than aesthetic or formalist concerns justify an application of the term to
other than classically normative models, tragedy
does not articulate a universal human essence

revealed in suffering. While the grounds of tragic
pathos are, as Job blasphemously implied, more
just than God, tragedy, as the Book of Job also
suggests, is not so much a universal representation of human suffering as it is in each case
a specific, and thus historically contextualized,
protest against the unfathomable unreason and
disproportion of its cause.
Aristotle’s theory underwent numerous reiterations and refinements that arguably culminate
in Hegel. While Hegel’s theory of tragedy as a
collision of equally justified powers, of good
with good (as Aeschylus had already posited),
offers insight into tragedy as a profound crisis
of values, his ethical or aesthetic sublation of
that collision in an “eternal justice” offers that
crisis, in turn, a final aesthetic resolution. However, as Murray Krieger has pointed out, Hegel’s
classical theory cannot represent “the self-conscious
modernism . . . characterized by fragmentation
rather than by the ever-uniting synthesis which
Hegel tried valiantly, if vainly, to impose upon
it as its salvation.”
Similar critiques of the aesthetic, beginning
with Kierkegaard’s and Nietzsche’s philosophies
and continuing in the work, among others, of
Walter Benjamin, Antonin Artaud, and Bertold
Brecht, and culminating in poststructuralist
readings of tragedy, account for an ensuing critical tradition in which Aristotelian, or classical,
tragedy is seen as an aestheticizing of human
suffering – although such a view might not do
justice to the textually disruptive and subversive
properties of classical tragedies. Brecht’s attempts
to dispel aesthetic illusion by an alienation effect,
as Walter Kaufmann argues, overlooks the many
rhetorical ways – the masks being the most
obvious, or the play within the play in Hamlet,
for example – by which tragedies self-critically
reflect on problems of the representation of suffering. Stephen Booth’s explanation of the term
suggests its opaque qualities. For Booth, tragedy
is “the word by which the mind designates (and
thus in part denies) its helplessness before a concrete, particular, and thus undeniable demonstration of the limits of human understanding.”
Kierkegaard subjected the term tragedy to
substantive revaluation. Responding to Hegel’s
subjection of individual moral justification to a
universal order, Kierkegaard raised the suffering
of the individual (Abraham on the way to sacrifice

691
narrative resonance of suffering – thus remains
unacknowledged and anonymous. For Georg
Lukács just this autonomy and anonymity constitutes the tragic: “loneliness is the very essence
of tragedy” and therefore “The language of the
absolutely lonely man is lyrical, monological.” It
is thus precisely the dramatic, communal form of
drama that contradicts “the essence of tragedy.”
If Aristotle’s notions of the serious, or of the
magnitude of the fall of the hero, assign a value
to suffering, more so does the “design” of the plot
itself. Its logic and closure define the concept of
suffering as a temporality, a narrative, and thus
suggest the possibility of suffering as communal,
eliciting a response. By contrast, such representations of tragedy as the stories of Kafka, the
poetry of Paul Celan, or the theater of Samuel
Beckett radically pose in their aesthetic and
thematic discontinuities, and their subversions
of genre, the question of the sharability of pain
itself.
Aristotle’s disparaging remarks about the “episodic,” defined as acts that “succeed one another
without probable or necessary sequence,” may
be said to prefigure the fragmentary, isolated, or
anonymous representation of suffering in modern
texts. Illustrating the importance of action as an
organizing principle in tragedy, Aristotle refers to
“the parallel in painting, where the most beautiful colors laid on without order will not give one
the same pleasure as a simple black-and-white
sketch of a portrait.” The pleasure that such
colors laid on without order cannot give results
from their failure to impose sense and order
on the episodic, accidental nature of suffering.
However, as Raymond Williams has pointed
out, such distinctions between tragedy and accident, or between tragedy and “mere suffering,”
always imply an ideology of the aesthetic as
superior to common suffering – especially when
experienced by persons of lower social station –
and thus of such suffering as lacking in tragic
significance.
The representation of suffering as episodic
or accidental also confronts the paradox of the
represention of the unrepresentable. One of the
most complex responses to this paradox occurs
in Theodor Adorno’s notion of aesthetic autonomy as removed from and indifferent to
suffering, while at the same time as an image
of the autonomy of suffering owing it its gravity.

tragedy

Isaac), insofar as it constitutes an incomprehensible or incommunicable situation, beyond
Hegel’s universals. For Kierkegaard, the classical
tragic hero who willingly sacrifices himself for
an ethical cause belies true suffering; he provides
“a trim, clean, and, as far as possible, faultless
edition of himself, readable by all,” and makes
a dancing step through his trials in comparison
with Kierkegaard’s “knight of faith.” Kierkegaard’s
critique of the readable, or understandable,
quality of tragedy leaves us with the radically
unreadable quality of suffering itself.
Though long understood as an exemplification
of pious patience in suffering, the Book of Job
may demonstrate on several levels the paradox
between individual suffering and the problematic,
if necessary, nature of its aesthetic or theological
containment. To imagine Job entirely without
these contexts would be to follow his wife’s
advice, “curse God, and die,” or to arrive at a conception of the term tragedy where any meaning
of suffering – cultural, aesthetic, or spiritual –
would no longer be available. Perhaps the voice
in Eliot’s The Waste Land that “can connect /
Nothing with nothing” speaks out of such aesthetic
and spiritual deprivation. Perhaps the silences and
brevities of Beckett’s theater echo the absence of
all those affirmative Aristotelian principles by
which suffering once had magnitude and meaning.
One might want to insist that the ironic or
solipsistic nature of suffering in modern literature
may not be deserving of the moral and aesthetic
values associated with tragedy and that for these
specific experiences other terms, such as tragicomedy (Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, for example)
or the concept of an absurd theater, would have
to be employed. The dramatic forms of tragedy
had attempted to redeem the anonymity of
suffering through the very genre of drama,
which, constituting a shared social experience, may
either symbolize the presence of divine auditors
or substitute for their absence. Modern tragedy,
by contrast, particularly if it is offered in the
individualized solitary genre of the novel or of
the lyric, or if its structure radically undermines
plot, declares such acts of social, let alone metaphysical, connection no longer possible.
The autonomy of these genres implies the loss
or absence of social, moral, or cosmic contexts
to suffering. The pain of the solitary individual
– the pain that does not attain the collective,

The significance of a valorization of the autonomous aesthetic work as capable of tragic content
might gesture beyond what Raymond Williams has
called the ideology of academic or normative
traditions of tragedy. The significance of a new
definition of tragedy, according to Williams, is
to integrate suffering into a continuing sense of
life. Failure to establish such connections would
“admit a strange and particular bankruptcy, which
no rhetoric of tragedy can finally hide.”

`transcendental philosophy 
Transcendental philosophy is characterized by the attempt
to ground the possibility of certainty in a conception of the human being as a detached knower
or agent, and by the related commitment to the
primacy of scientific knowledge over other modes
of knowing and relating to the world. As such,
transcendental philosophy is a foundationalist
project committed to characterizing and vindicating precisely the conception of the human
Subject which is criticized by Postmodernism.
Transcendental philosophy is widely acknow-

ledged to have been initiated and most significantly influenced by Kant. He was the first thinker
to maintain a rigorous distinction between
“transcendent” and “transcendental,” where the
former term signifies that which lies beyond the
scope of human thought and experience, and
the latter term refers to those most fundamental
and unchanging characteristics of human subjectivity which serve as “the conditions for the
possibility” of coherent experience generally and
scientific knowledge in particular. In Christian
medieval thought, God had been conceived as
the transcendent; Kant’s turn to the transcendental
conditions for the possibility of coherent human
experience and certain knowledge brings with it
a rejection of the idea, advanced by the likes of
Aquinas and Descartes, that God’s existence
could be demonstrated cognitively in addition
to being an article of faith. For Kant, what had
previously been conceived as the transcendent
cannot be known but at best can be thought;
the prospects for certain knowledge are limited
to mathematics and nature as experienced concretely. In developing his conception of human
subjectivity in The Critique of Reason (1781/7),
Kant thought that he had exhibited the timeless,
ahistorical, transcultural, and essentially incorporeal features of human experience which make
absolutely certain knowledge possible; and he
thought that the human subject’s ability both to
establish scientific knowledge and think beyond
the limits of such knowledge made it possible
for the subject to establish ethical commitments
and aesthetic judgments which, while not purely
objective, are necessitated by the nature of
thought and hence are neither arbitrary nor historically relative.
Almost invariably, subsequent work in transcendental philosophy explicitly acknowledges
its debt to Kant, indeed to such an extent that it
would be difficult to separate the spirit of Kant’s
work from any philosophical endeavor that falls
under the rubric of “transcendental philosophy.”
Transcendental philosophy after Kant has been
concerned with precisely those tasks which Kant
set for himself: the refutation of skepticism
regarding the existence of the external word and
other minds, as well as the vindication of objective scientific knowledge.
In the twentieth century no thinker has done
more in the service of these aims than the

693
experience. This reflection on the features of
human experience which contribute to our vision
of what is real has led a variety of contemporary
thinkers to include the particularity of cultural perspective, as well as the influence of language and
the Body, among the “conditions for possibility”
which underlie coherent experience and knowledge claims. While thinkers like Thomas Kuhn
remain open to the possibility of incommensurable ways of experiencing the world, thinkers
such as Donald Davidson and Richard Rorty
have sought to argue that the notion of alternative
conceptual frameworks is essentially incoherent,
generally on the grounds that the possibility of such
alternative schemes would entail the impossibility of those schemes determining the content of
our experience.

`transference (counter) 
In psychoanalytic
theory, transference refers to the actualization
of unconscious wishes or prototypes, particularly within the analytic situation (Laplanche
and Pontalis, 1967, p. 455). Infantile prototypes,
memories, or desires are transferred or projected
on to the analyst, and are experienced with a
feeling of great immediacy. The process usually
entails the identification of the analyst with an
important figure from childhood. The term is
also sometimes used more generally to refer to
all aspects of the patient’s relationship with the
analyst. Countertransference describes the analyst’s
unconscious reaction to the analysand, and
especially to his or her transference.
Initially, Freud took the view that transference
was a form of displacement of effect or emotional
charges on to the person of the analyst, and that

transference (counter)

German philosopher Edmund Husserl. With his
emphasis on phenomenological, transcendental,
and eidetic reductions as the necessary methodological steps towards the disclosure of the transcendental domain, Husserl seeks to vindicate the
Western scientific project by establishing it upon
the foundation of the human knower conceived
as the transcendental ego; in making this turn to
the transcendental ego, Husserl places intentional
acts, with their act–noema structure, at the methodological core of all scientific investigation.
More recent work in transcendental philosophy
has devoted itself primarily to an examination
of the nature and possibility of transcendental
arguments. Transcendental arguments are arguments which seek to establish the necessary
conditions for the possibility of something being
the case and for the possibility of saying truly that
something is the case. The emphasis which has
been placed on conceptual schemes in this work
on transcendental arguments has led some contemporary thinkers into a debate concerning the
very possibility of alternative conceptual frameworks. The argument in favor of alternative
conceptual frameworks maintains that whatever
concepts may be fundamental to our ability to
know ourselves and the world, there are necessarily other, alternative, conceptual frameworks
which could render experience coherent. Kant
believed that the subject invariably operates with
fixed forms of space and time and with a set of
12 specific concepts or “categories” in establishing knowledge; for example, he believed that
Euclidean geometry exhibits rigorous certainty
precisely because it describes the form of our
necessary experience of spatiality or “outer sense,”
and he similarly believed that arithmetic is certain because it describes the form of our internal
time consciousness or “inner sense.” The argument for alternative conceptual frameworks rejects
this commitment to a rigid and unchanging set
of forms of experience, and it leaves open the
possibility that the conceptual schemes we employ
are subject to variation. In particular, developments
in mathematics (such as non-Euclidean geometries) and physics (discoveries regarding the
heterogeneity of space and of time) have led to
a radicalization of Kant’s own “Copernican
revolution,” so that arithmetic and Euclidean
geometry have come to be accepted as idealized
distortions of actual (and possible) human

it was to be analyzed and treated like any other
symptom. Tranferences were new editions or
facsimiles of the impulses and fantasies aroused
in analysis (Freud, 1905, p. 116). The material
appearing in the transference was repetitive,
tended to block the emergence of new associations,
and could be seen as a form of resistance.
Indeed, Freud held (1905) that the inconclusive
analysis of the patient known as “Dora” was a
direct result of his failure to analyze the transference. In later papers, Freud still refers to
transference as an obstacle to analysis, but also
comes to recognize that transference manifestations are the only thing that makes possible the
actualization of repressed or forgotten emotions
(Freud, 1912).
Lacan initially (1951) describes transference in
terms of a quasi-Hegelian dialectic of identifications; he later (1977) relates it to the fantasy
– found in both the analytic and the pedagogic
situation – of a “subject presumed to know.”

`translation studies 
A term in use since the
early 1970s to describe the study of the processes
of translation beyond the purely linguistic. Some
scholars maintain that translation studies is now
a discipline in its own right, and the proliferation
of books, journals, conferences, international associations, degree programs, and chairs appears to
confirm that view. Translation studies is closely
related to intercultural studies, since the object of
study is to examine systematically the processes
of transfer of Texts across cultural boundaries,
and the resulting implications for both source and
target cultural Systems.
Current work in translation studies evolved
largely as a reaction against (i) the marginalization of translation in literary studies; (ii) the
decontextualized approach of much work on
translation within linguistics. Its development
has also been assisted by growing recognition
of the significance of translation as a factor for
cultural change, and the role played by translations in Canon formation and in the evolution
of literary genres.
The move toward translation studies as distinct
from the long history of pragmatic statements on
the nature and difficulties of translating, from the
Romans onwards, can be traced to developments
in computer translation techniques in the period
immediately after the 1939–45 war and to the
work of Eugene Nida, who endeavored to introduce scientific analysis into the translation of the
Bible. The key issues emerging from these forms
of translation were definitions of untranslatability and the problematization of the nature of
equivalence between languages. J. Catford (1965)
tried to distinguish between linguistic and cultural
untranslatability, arguing that linguistic untranslatability is due to differences of lexicon and
syntax between source and target languages,
while cultural untranslatability is due to the
absence in the receiving Culture of a relevant
situational feature in the source culture. Nida
(1960; 1964) distinguished between two types of
equivalence, formal and dynamic. He proposed

695
Europe, translation studies is increasingly linked
to developments in postcolonial theory, where
the old-style dominance of the source text or
“original” is called into question. The Brazilian
“cannibalistic” school of translation studies,
led by the de Campos brothers, exemplifies this
new approach, which studies the question of the
reappropriation of the original by a new, liberated culture with metaphors of cannibalism and
diabolical transformation.
The range of developments in the broad field
of translation studies now includes: a growing
number of philosophical studies deconstructing
the concept of the original and the problems of
meaning, interpretation, and relevance (Derrida,
1985 (in Graham, 1985); Benjamin, 1989; Gutt,
1990); translation and Discourse analysis (BlumKulka, 1981; Snell-Hornby, 1988; Hatim and
Mason, 1990; Baker, 1992); translation as intercultural transfer, a highly charged activity that
throws into question assumptions about universals, cultural individuality, and hierarchies
of literary development (Kittel, 1990; Frank,
1991; Venuti, 1992). As the subject increases in
importance, there has been a notable increase
in textbooks on the teaching of translation, and
further work on translation and interpreting,
translation and bilingualism, translation and
psychology, all of which bring translation
studies closer to the pragmatics of teaching and
practicing translation.
A major development in translation studies
from the mid-1980s is work on issues of Gender
and translation. Of particular significance is the
Canadian school (Brisset, Brossard, Godard,
de Lotbinière-Harwood, and Simon) which uses
feminist theory to investigate the inbetweenness of translation, rejecting bipolarity between
source and target texts, parallel to the rejection
of a Binary oppositional model of gender
differentiation.
Translation studies as a field of study is distinct
from practical training programs for translators.
It can be seen as a branch of literary and cultural
history, which examines the factors of textual
transfer and compares the reception of texts
in both source and target cultures. The pattern
of work from the mid-1970s has been a shift
away from Formalism toward an emphasis on
ideology and the role played by translators in
shaping individual literary systems.

translation studies

formal equivalence as focusing on the form
and content of a text, in contrast to dynamic
equivalence, which focused on equivalent effect
between receivers in source and target cultures. Such distinctions offered an alternative
perspective on the traditional distinction made
by translators following Cicero and St Jerome
between word for word and sense for sense
translation, open to a wide range of interpretations. By the early 1970s the debate on the
nature of equivalence was extensive, but was
superseded by a new approach that took the
notion of equivalent effect much further, with
emphasis directed away from the source and
toward the receiving culture.
That approach was polysystems theory, propounded by Evan-Zohar (1976; 1978) and Toury
(1978; 1980) in Tel-Aviv and taken up by a
group of scholars working in the Netherlands
and Belgium (Holmes, Lambert, Lefevere, Van
den Broek, and Van Leuven). Polysystems theory
linked translation directly to cultural history
by focusing on the reception of the text in the
target cultural system. It also offered a model
for describing and measuring the impact of
translated texts on the target culture, giving rise
to what has become a major branch of translation studies, the history of translation in theory
and practice.
Although deriving from a structuralist model,
polysystems theory parallels developments in
reception theory and Deconstruction. Translation studies from the 1980s onwards has seen
a move toward greater integration of trends in
literary theory, Cultural studies, and linguistics.
The so-called Manipulation Group (Hermans,
Bassnett, Lambert, and Lefevere) has stressed the
ideological implications of translation, looking
at the role played by cultural politics in determining not only which texts are translated in a
given literary system, but also why and how they
are translated. In the United States, the translation workshop approach developed in Iowa
has moved closer to the historical research into
translation practice going on in institutions like
SUNY, Binghamton, and Amherst, Massachussetts. In Germany, the Göttingen school has begun
systematically to examine the history of translated
literary texts between German and English,
paying special attention to the role played by
editors and compilers of anthologies. Outside

`Trilling, Lionel (1905–75) 
American literary
critic and essayist. A Columbia professor linked
to the Partisan Review group of “New York intellectuals,” he expressed the cultural anxieties of a
rational Liberalism under threat from modern
irrationalisms, seeking reasonable compromises
between self and society. Like Leavis, but far less
dogmatically, he engaged in Moral criticism and

placed Literary criticism at the center of liberal
Culture. His critical studies of Arnold and
Forster admire their flexibly tolerant attitudes. His
essays, notably in The Liberal Imagination (1950),
explore the relationships between literature,
morality, and politics; some also consider subtly
the cultural implications of Freud’s work.

`trope 
A term in the art of rhetoric usually
defined as an instance of the use of words to mean
something other than what they normally mean.
Although this definition is firmly established in
the Western rhetorical tradition that descends
from Quintillian and Cicero, it is now common
to observe that such a definition uncritically
assumes that there is a normal use of words that
can be distinguished from the figurative or the
tropological. An inescapable historical problem in
understanding tropes is that, particularly during
the European Renaissance, the art of rhetoric as
a practical field of study for politicians, lawyers,
and poets developed rapidly and usually independently from critical reflection on the nature
of language. By the sixteenth century the general
availability of printed books made possible a
thriving market for rhetorical handbooks, of
which Erasmus’s De copia (1521) is justly the
most famous. As with all dictionaries and encyclopedias, however, these handbooks, by defining
and exemplifying rhetorical tropes, tended to
rigidify them and to create the mistaken view
that normal language is something other than
tropological. Furthermore, they tended to perpetuate Quintillian’s favoring of Metaphor over
Metonymy and a general Renaissance preference
for imagery over other figures. In his brilliant
examination of the consequences of insufficient
reflection on these assumptions, Derrida (1982,
pp. 255–6) turns to the nineteenth-century text
by Pierre Fontanier, Les Figures du discours (1821),
which epitomizes the ubiquitous “metaphorical
lexis” in philosophy, to the effect that word
and idea, thought and speech are necessarily

697

“A fictional narration to present the
truth by presenting images of the
truth.” (Scaliger: Sonnino, p. 98)
Antiphrasis: “For single words when one by one
we mean its opposite.” (Susenbrotus: Sonnino, p. 131)
Catachresis: “The practice of adapting the
nearest available term to describe
something for which no proper
term exists. . . . Therefore it differs
from a metaphor which changes the
proper term into another one.”
(Susenbrotus: Sonnino, p. 16)
Hyperbole:
“An elegant straining of the truth
which may be employed either for
exaggeration or attenuation. . . .
We may say more than the actual
facts.” (Quintillian: Sonnino, p. 68)
Irony:
“We understand something the
opposite of what is actually said.”
(Quintillian: Sonnino, p. 105)
Metaphor:
“The commonest and by far the
most beautiful of tropes. . . . A
noun or verb is transferred from the
place to which it properly belongs
to another where there is no literal
term or the transferred is better
than the literal.” (Quintillian:
Sonnino, pp. 181–2)
Metonymy: “A noun is substituted for a noun
in such a way that we substitute the
cause of the thing . . . for the thing
itself. . . . We do this in several
ways, substituting the container
for the thing contained. . . . , an
author for his work, . . . the sign for
the thing signified.” (Susenbrotus:
Sonnino, pp. 184–5)
Prosopopoeia: “[We] attribute any human quality,
as reason or speech, to dumb

Synecdoche:

creatures or other insensible things
and do study to give them a human
person . . . by way of fiction.”
(Puttenham: Sonnino, p. 55)
“When we understand one thing
for another . . . the whole for the
part, . . . the species for the genus.”
(Erasmus: Sonnino, p. 172)

Several of these definitions seem about to undermine the linguistic assumptions on which they rest.

`Tugendhat, Ernst (1930–) 
German philosopher; professor at the Freie Universität in
Berlin. In his landmark work, The Concept of
Truth in Husserl and Heidegger (1970), Tugendhat
contrasts Husserl’s intentionality based conception of truth with the senses of truth which
Heidegger develops before and after his “turning,” and he demonstrates the fundamentally
decisionistic (and hence nihilistic) character of
truth in Heidegger’s Being and Time. In his other
major work, Tugendhat develops a theory of
rationality which rejects “object-centered” philosophies of language in favor of an analysis of meaning in terms of linguistic usage; as part of this
theory he argues for a version of a consensus
theory of truth, according to which the decisions
made by the most experienced members of the
relevant community serve as the proper measure
for moral justification.

Some of the more important tropes that appear
in classical and Renaissance rhetorics are briefly

`Tynyanov, Yury (1894–1943) 
Russian literary
scholar and novelist, one of the leading representatives of Russian formalism. Tynyanov’s
critical works can be divided into those dealing
with the historical aspects of language and literature and those dealing with literary theory. In
his historical works, collected later into his book
of essays Archaists and Innovators (1929), the
center of Tynyanov’s attention was the conflict
between various artistic trends for what he
called “a new vision.” In his theoretical works,
Tynyanov continued Potebnya’s studies of the distinction between poetic language and the language
of prose (Problems of Poetic Language, 1924).
Tynyanov’s contribution to the studies of poetic

language consisted of the discovery of the
“dynamism” of poetic language which anticipated the views of some Marxist theorists like G.
Lucács, on the one hand, and first Czech and later
French and American structuralists on the other.

`uncanny, the 
Freud’s essay on “The uncanny”
(1919) is an exploration of what he terms a
relatively neglected province of the Aesthetic,
and concentrates upon works of Art that provoke feelings of unease, dread, or horror. Freud
explores the semantics and etymology of the
German terms unheimlich (“uncanny”) and
heimlich (“homely,” “familiar”) and reaches the
conclusion that the uncanny relates to a domain
in which the apparent antonyms are actually
synonymous and refer to an experience which is
at once uncanny and familiar. The “uncanny
familiar” is a fairly obvious expression of ambivalence, but Freud is also influenced here by his
reading of the philologist Karl Abel’s theories
about the antithetical meaning of primal words
and the thesis that dreams and ancient languages
often have only a single word to describe two
contraries (Freud, 1910a). The Ambiguity of the
heimlich/unheimlich doublet can thus be related
on a philological basis to the survival in the
Unconscious of primitive elements and to
the thesis that the uncanny is an instance of the
animistic view of the universe. In that sense, the
uncanny represents the emergence of something
which was once familiar (animism) and which
has been repressed and alienated from the mind.
Freud’s second approach centers on a thematic
reading of Hoffman’s stories “The sandman”
and “The Devil’s elixir.” It is also a highly selective reading. Freud concentrates on elements
which can be related to fear of castration (severed

limbs, the children’s eyes which the sandman
magically removes and carries off to feed his
children). The uncanny can now be associated with
a male neurotic claim that there is something
uncanny about the female genitals, a theme also
explored in the brief paper on Medusa’s head
(Freud, 1922). That unheimlich place is of course
the entrance to the original home (Heim) of all
human beings. It was once a familiar place, and
the prefix un is an index of its repression.
Despite its brevity, “The uncanny” continues
to exert a considerable fascination for writers
exploring the relationship between Psychoanalysis and literature (Kofman, 1974), as well
as feminist writers, many of whom are critical of
the selectivity of Freud’s reading. Thus Cixous
(1976a) notes that Freud dismisses as irrelevant
the figure of the doll which becomes animated in
Hoffman’s tale; she in contrast argues, in terms
similar to those used by Todorov (1970) in his
discussion of the fantastic, that it is precisely the
blurring of the animate/inanimate that produces
the frisson of the uncanny. Kristeva (1980)
exploits Freud’s essay to construct her own notion
of the abject, which describes the experience of a
primal fear of the Subject’s abolition within the
maternal Body, and argues that this fear predates
castration anxiety.

`unconscious, the 
Although the notion of
unconscious thoughts or impulses has a long
history in both philosophy and psychology (see
Ellenberger, 1970), the modern concept of the
unconscious derives from the theory and practice
of Psychoanalysis, as defined by Freud and his
followers. A distinction should be made between
Freudian usage and the notion of a collective
unconscious, as elaborated by Jung.
Freud uses both the adjective “unconscious,”
which describes phenomena that are not within
the field of consciousness at any given moment,
and the noun “the unconscious.” The latter term
is used in a topographical sense to refer to one of
the three Systems that constitute the psychical
apparatus, the others being the preconscious and
conscious systems. After the introduction, from
1920 onwards (see in particular Freud, 1923a), of
the second or so-called structural topography
of id, ego, and superego, Freud tends to revert to
the adjectival usage, though the id does display
many of the characteristics previously ascribed
to the unconscious. The term “id” (German Es)
is borrowed from Groddeck (1923), a psychiatrist
close to the Viennese psychonalytic milieu;
Groddeck himself claims to have taken the term
from Nietzsche.
The topographical concept of a systemic unconscious is operative in Freud’s earliest works and
especially in his great study of dreams (Freud,
1900), but it is in a metapsychological paper of
1915 that he provides the clearest description
of what is to be understood by the unconscious
(Freud, 1915). The unconscious is a necessary concept because it alone can explain a number of
“gaps” in conscious life; these include Parapraxes

such as slips of the tongue, obsessions, and
symptoms, and of course dreams, “the royal
road” to the discovery of the unconscious.
Phenomena such as posthypnotic suggestion
and the practice of psychoanalysis itself provide
further evidence for its existence. On the basis
of these and related phenomena, Freud posits
the existence of unconscious mental processes.
The content of the unconscious consists of elements which are unacceptable to the conscious
mind, and which have been censored or repressed.
The unconscious also contains survivals of the
infantile residues of early stages of development;
it is often described as being primitive or archaic
and Freud argues that is in part a phylogenetic
inheritance which contains elements of humanity’s earliest experiences. That inheritance is
also said to contain primal fantasies or scenes
(including observation of parental sexual intercourse, castration, and seduction), which together
form an unconscious nucleus constituted from a
hypothetical process of primal repression. More
importantly, the content of the unconscious
consists of representatives or images of the basic
instincts or drives (sexual drives and instincts of
self-preservation; after the turning point of 1920,
a death drive is also introduced and described as
a desire to return to an inanimate state). The drives
themselves, which exist at the interface between
the psychic and thesomatic, can never become an
object of consciousness, and it follows that the
unconscious is known only through its manifestations. Its primary manifestations are mainly
dreams, although symptoms, fantasies, and obsessions are also indications of its existence.
The unconscious System is characterized by a
number of special features. Its instinctual representations or wishful impulses do not acknowledge the existence of negation or the principle
of non-contradiction. They are dominated by the
primary processes of Condensation/displacement and are timeless. Unlike the mechanisms
of the conscious-preconscious system, they take
no account of external reality, which is replaced
with internal reality. The system is further
characterized by the free circulation of cathexis,
or of the quantities of psychic energy attached to
ideas and representations. Unconscious processes
are subject to the pleasure principle; this is the
mechanism which seeks to reduce excitation and
to restore a degree of equilibrium to the system.

`urban culture 
The processes of worldwide
urbanization have consistently stimulated
attempts to analyze distinctive cultural features
of urban life. They have differed sharply in their
focus and method, articulating various stages of
urbanization and successive intellectual debates and
preoccupations.
An early set of comparisons, often of a strongly
moral kind, was drawn between the urban world
and that of the countryside. Ruralism became
part of an implicit anti-urbanism, as in some
early twentieth-century constructions of “Englishness.” In sociology, Toennies and others followed
the work of many earlier Romantic writers in
distinguishing the closeness and community of
rural Gemeinschaft from the impersonality and
Alienation of Gesellschaft. As cities grew, attracting waves of migration, they exhibited ever more
sharply contrasting and varied social worlds, so
that broad ideal typical contrasts were replaced
by studies of different localities, groups, and
Subcultures. Closely focused work typified
much of the Chicago school, the community
studies of the 1950s and after, and then the
radical action analyses stemming from the 1960s.
Carefully descriptive and empirical writing looked
at particular life patterns within the inequality
and diversity of large conurbations. These were
in turn challenged by a larger-scale structural
analysis of the workings of capital mobility and
the state in the recomposition of cities, as in
seminal though contrasting Marxist work by
Castells and by Harvey. To the previous research
concerns of a subdiscipline of “urban sociology”
were added attention to land values, the politics
of city government and new urban protest
movements, and a heightened interest in uneven
development.
Elsewhere Benjamin had developed a series of
fragmentary, dense, and fascinating exploratory
“readings” of urban settings, illuminating such
topics as the arcade or the male flâneur’s right
to stroll and look on the City’s streets. The city
is written by him as a place of contradiction,
fantasy, and dream. His work exemplifies the

urban culture

While all psychoanalytic literature can in some
sense be regarded as making a contribution to
the theory of the unconscious, by far the most
extensive reformulation is that proposed by
Jacques Lacan. In a famous passage of his “Rome
discourse” of 1953, Lacan (1977, p. 50) describes
the unconscious as a censored chapter in the
history of the subject. It has been censored or
occupied by a falsehood. The truth has, however,
been written down elsewhere: in “monuments”
or, in other words, in the nucleus of a neurosis
where the symptom reveals the Structure of
a language; in inscriptions which have to be
deciphered, in the documents of childhood
memories, in the individual’s stock of words
and character traits, and in the few traces that
have been preserved by the need to connect the
distorted chapter to those surrounding it.
Lacan describes the unconscious as being structured like a language on a number of grounds,
not least the standard view that psychoanalysis is
a talking cure with language as its sole medium.
On the one hand, symptoms and unconscious
formations like the Dream-work exhibit the
same formal properties as rhetorical figures
like Metaphor and Metonymy, which can
be likened to condensation and displacement
respectively. On the other hand, the findings of
linguistics, and Saussure in particular, reveal
structures analogous to those found in the formations of the unconscious. Dream images are
accordingly described by Lacan as signifiers.
Although Lacan’s reformulation of the concept of the unconscious is persuasive and has
been enormously influential, it is not always easy
to reconcile it with Freud, for whom language
is a phenomenon specific to the consciousnessperception system.

complexity and difficulty of modernism, itself
seen by Williams as made possible in its concerns
and forms by emigration to dislocated spaces
within the “imperial and capitalist metropolis.”
In Berman’s highly original text, connections
were made between various cities and Texts
and between modernist art, modernization, and
Modernity. That such accounts may be genderblind or masculinist has been increasingly
emphasized by such feminists as Wilson, who
suggests ways in which cities may be positive
sites for women and not only places of danger.
Extensive recent changes in capitalist cities
have been a major theme in analyses both
skeptical and celebratory of Postmodernism.
Typical issues have been urban architecture, the
heightened emphasis on consumption spaces,
Signs and spectacle, gentrification, and the
working-up of cities as imaginaries in a competition for tourism and business investment.
Recent work has also questioned the suitability
of cities as convivial living spaces (often with Los
Angeles as model or warning), or as coherent
entities in a decentered era of accelerated global
movement. While the history of thinking about

cities has been constantly interrupted by such
doubts, urban changes (different political strategies in defense of “places,” intraurban conflicts,
new lived crossovers and hybridities between
groups and cultural forms in city spaces) continue
to provoke prolific and cogent work currently
developing in various directions not easily
reconciled. Urban culture remains almost an
impossible object of study, but an extremely
interesting one.

`value in literature 
In the present state of the
argument it would be rash to attempt a definition of literary value. To do so would entail the
bold claim that one had already settled the more
general problem of value. These remarks fall
roughly under two headings: first, some observations, far from exhaustive, on the ways the problem is now being discussed; and secondly some
speculations of a more literary variety, perhaps less
arid though probably no less contentious.
The writhing subtleties of axiological debate,
once the concern of philosophers, are now proper
to literary-critical Discourse. The old assumptions were that some things, some attitudes, some
books, were more valuable than others, and that
if there were disputes about which were the
valuable things, attitudes, books, there was little
disposition to argue that such evaluations should
be preceded by questions of what philosophical
foundations they might depend upon. However,
the wall between the Subjects has been at least
partly demolished. Some philosophers roam freely
across the literary terrain, and some literary
critics sound or wish to sound more like philosophers. Many of them even seem to be suffering a certain loss of interest in literature, even
of confidence in its existence. They want to
know not only what and where it is, but also
whether, if it does exist, it has value and of what
kind. This worry provides an occasion for discourses of many other sorts than those formerly
associated with Literary criticism. These

deviations or defections or derelictions arise in
part from a moral uncertainty about whether
what used to be unequivocally and honorifcally
called literature may be, in its effects, an evil
rather than a good thing.
How then can one hope to evaluate it, or
confirm former valuations that persisted for so
long without satisfactory testing, without considering it in the broader contexts now thought
appropriate? And so the philosophical issue of
value has of late become one of the preoccupations
of literary theorists. Most agree that the subject
is difficult, and nobody has produced completely
persuasive answers to the questions it now seems
necessary to put.
Value, in the literary-critical world, used to be
either taken for granted or considered off limits
in so far as the supposedly value-free discourse
of the sciences was what, for the sake of academic
respectability if for no better reason, literary
study should be seen to aspire to. Such were the
assumptions of the old-style philology, and more
recently of early Structuralism. However, there
was another reason: it used to be assumed that
what could be said in analyzing a “verbal icon”
was itself a tacit demonstration of its positive
value, so that in practice brute enquiries about
the nature of that value, and whom it counted as
such, were simply not made. So Barbara Herrnstein Smith, in the most impressive of modern
philosophico-literary critical treatises on the
subject, can speak of the long exile of the topic

value in literature

V

value in literature

704
of value from American criticism, especially since
Northrop Frye’s powerful polemical Introduction
to his Anatomy of Criticism (1957), and suggest
that it was not recalled till much later. Perhaps
that somewhat overstates the case, not only
because Yvor Winters, like F.R. Leavis in England,
was always confident of, if not always constant or
wholly persuasive in, his evaluations, and would
have regarded it as absurd to question whether
the values he found in Poetry were there
already or had to be inserted; but also because a
great many other people, professional and nonprofessional, some teachers, some mere readers,
more simply assumed that there were valuable
books, and even that some books were more
valuable than others, just as some pictures and
some jewels and some cups and saucers and, for
that matter, some restaurants and some footballers and some friends were, when it came to
the point, more valuable than others.
In the 30-odd years that divided the books
of Frye and Smith, there seem to have been few
other works which took the question of value
seriously. John Ellis, in his Theory of Literary
Criticism (1974) maintained that value was
“centrally part” of the definition of literature,
though he shied away from the idea of “aesthetic
value:” “It is essential to begin by saying that great
works of literature are those that are particularly
successful in performing as works of literature,
rather than by assuming that they have a quality
called aesthetic value, which we must then try
to locate” (p. 88). What one seeks, according to
Ellis, are the “facts” of the work’s structure
that relate to performance; this will not help
to establish criteria, but descriptive analysis of
a work “is the only possible approach to the
question of its value. The critic investigates value
empirically; he does not determine it, and his
investigations have to do with whatever relates to
the ability of literary texts to function as literary
texts.” That remark would be entirely vacuous
if its author were not sure he knew what a
“literary” Text was, and of course Ellis was sure.
He explains that literary texts are distinguished
from others in that “they are used by society
in such a way that the text is not taken as
specifically relevant to the immediate context
of its origin,” whereas “ordinary pieces of language . . . function in the context in which they
originate” (p. 44). However, this rule would

introduce into the category of literature (which
is the way value, according to this view, is
asserted) matter that is not usually regarded as
literature at all: statutes, for instance. Ellis’s
criteria for literature are perhaps more persuasively
described thus: as weeds are weeds, however
diverse their structures and properties, only
because we agree to distinguish them by this
name from the plants we choose to nurture, so
texts are literary if members of the language
community agree to call them so, and not if
they do not.
Ellis was writing before this agreement began
to break down, and professional circles began
to dissociate themselves from common linguistic
practice, at any rate when being very professional
(for the slack colloquial habit of saying that one
poem or lecture or whatever is more valuable,
“greater,” “more profound,” etc. than another will
persist in unguarded moments). Back in 1974
Ellis knew, or imagined he knew, what it was that
literary criticism could properly undertake to
work on, and so could proceed to explain how it
should do so; but nobody can now be so confident about what is to be described or analyzed,
and so evaluated, or how those inquiries are to
be conducted.
John Reichert, in Making Sense of Literature
(1977) took a not very different view of the
evaluator’s role. “When we say that a work is good
in some respects, and provide the right sort of
reasons for our judgment, we are describing the
work, and our description may be true or false”
(p. 174). It is by means of such descriptions
that we make evaluations; and by evaluations
we promote understanding, if, presumably, the
descriptions are true. Really, for Reichert, evaluating a work is an act identical with that of
making sense of it by a new description. The
work under consideration may very well have
already been highly valued and often interpreted
or described, as in a case he considers at length,
that of Huckleberry Finn. An examination of
some of the descriptions accorded this novel
allows him to ask a final rhetorical question:
“What impels and gives point to criticism’s
pursuit of ever more refined and true ways of
making sense of a novel like Huckleberry Finn
if not a desire to get its value rightly placed and
understood?” (p. 203). Clearly Reichert accepts
that the prior esteem in which a work is held is

705
economies of communities and persons explain
the wide differences of valuation that occur
between communities, persons, and epochs.
It is a matter of importance to this author –
and it is probably the most compelling reason for
the question of value having been so insistently
raised in recent years – that valuations can be
manipulated or imposed. It is possible for an
institution to perpetuate not only itself but also
its valuations, and perhaps it needs to do one
to do the other; thus, despite the incursion of
various rebels or outsiders, the academic community “produces generation after generation
of subjects for whom the objects and texts thus
labeled [‘as works of art and literature’] do
indeed perform the functions thus privileged,
thereby ensuring the continuity of mutually
defining canonical works, canonical functions,
and canonical audiences” (p. 44). And here she
refers us to, and endorses, certain French Marxist
pronouncements about Literature as an Ideological Form. Smith appears to be persuaded
of the truth of Pierre Bourdieu’s thesis: that the
legitimation of certain kinds of Art or Culture
as superior is a means of reinforcing the idea of
the natural superiority of the social Class that
esteems them; and that such condemnations of
Popular culture as Adorno’s are a “reactionary response” to the “increasing contemporary
destratification of cultural arenas and practices”
(p. 76). Attempts like those of I.A. Richards
and Herbert Gans to show that in one way or
another “High” culture is more effective in
the provision of gratification than “low” culture;
that the difference can somehow be measured;
and that people can be educated to achieve the
superior gratification, are dismissed. It is true
that we can “acculturate” the young, persuade
them that it is a good thing to acquire an
understanding of and a taste for Beethoven’s
quartets, Quattrocento painting, Shakespeare’s
late tragedies, or wine; however, there is no way
of comparing the quantity of such pleasures with
the amount of gratification to be gained from
listening to Elvis Presley records, or watching
television soap operas, and drinking beer out of
cans. All value is contingent, and to behave as if
it were not so is to exercise over others a power
unjustly derived from privilege and status.
Terry Eagleton has developed similar points
in a somewhat different way, feeling a need to

value in literature

evidence of a value which is somehow already
there, if not yet “rightly placed” or described.
He also thinks we can progressively improve
on existing descriptions of it, so confirming that
it is a literary work, as well as reaffirming or
reinforcing its value. The value of the book is
somehow there in the book, waiting for somebody,
or preferably a succession of people, to come
and uncover it. The expression “a novel like
Huckleberry Finn” seems vague and unsteady,
but it must mean something like “works which
the community agrees to call ‘literary’ and which
it credits with some appropriate value.” It is
of such works that one can hope for further
descriptions, for progressive knowledge and
possibly higher and more accurate valuations.
The question whether this would be true not
only of “a novel like Huckleberry Finn” but
equally of “a novel like” one of Zane Grey’s,
which can now be freely posed, did not then present itself to the theorist, even though Reichert’s
book is not very old. Nevertheless, the assumptions that there is somehow there, in the text, a
value to be elicited, and that we can proceed as
if the sheep and the goats, the plants and the weeds,
were already firmly differentiated, are assumptions
now vigorously contested.
No doubt there were other significant treatments
of the question in these interim years. Mention
of Ellis and Reichert will hint at the change that
has come over us: we may call the views of Ellis
and Reichert typically modern, as opposed to what
are probably thought of as postmodern understandings of the question. The latter variety is
represented by Herrnstein Smith’s Contingencies
of Value (1988), originally subtitled Postaxiological Perspectives in Literary Theory, which was
changed to Alternative Perspectives. . . . Smith’s
main thesis is by now well known: all value is
“radically contingent” and “the value of not
only any artwork or other object but that of any
utterance is also contingent, and aesthetic judgments . . . are no different in this respect from
any other type of utterance, including so-called
factual or scientific statements.” She is clear that
value is not a fixed attribute or inherent quality
of things but rather “an effect of multiple,
continuously changing, and continuously interacting variables, or, to put it another way, the
product of the dynamics of a system, specifically
an economic system” (p. 30). Fluctuation in the

value in literature

demonstrate that the culture of a particular class,
dependent as it is on “aesthetic Ideology” (a concept at present under attack from Marxist and
deconstructionist alike) is historically inseparable
from bourgeois Hegemony; the Paradox, as
he sees it, is that a class that in his view really
cares very little about art has nevertheless used
it in this fraudulent way. As we have seen, Smith
argues, from different premises, that assumptions about value in the arts have similar political
implications.
To evaluate Smith’s book – its value would in
any case be complexly contingent – one would
need to say a great deal more about it. The present issue is this matter of the political uses
of attributed literary value. Smith at one point –
and this is representative of her sympathies
– signifies her approval of the views expressed by
the Nigerian-born writer Chinweiza in a letter to
the Times Literary Supplement (TLS). Chinweiza
said that his purpose was not “to thrust a black
face among the local idols of Europe which, to
our grave injury, have been bloated into ‘universality’” – and he specifies such local idols
as Shakespeare, Aristophanes, Dante, Milton,
Dostoevsky, Joyce, Pound, Sartre, Eliot, etc. –
but “rather . . . to help heave them out of the
way . . . by making it clear that we have among our
own the equals and betters of these chaps.” Smith
calls this “genuine evaluative conflict.” However, Geoffrey Galt Harpham (Raritan, Summer,
1989) points out that when Hume says Milton
is better than Ogilvy, or Rorty that Liberalism is
better than theocracy, Smith brands them as
oppressors. This looks like a direct hit, to which
a fashionable cause has exposed the usually more
circumspect author.
It may here be relevant to comment on an essay
by Susan Stuart on New York and Philadelphia
subway graffiti. It is clear that the practitioners and
connoisseurs of this art exist outside the limits
of that part of society which is interested in, and,
as some say, supported by, “high” art. That
members of the higher culture have appropriated
graffiti and sold them in galleries is not the
point; that kind of appropriation has been going
on for a long time. More interesting are the
activities of those who remain within the culture
of graffiti, to whom the Writing of graffiti is
an art that not only calls for some daring and
self-assertion in the practitioner, but also has its

mysteries, on which learned studies might be,
indeed have been, written. Outside the graffiti
community itself the “aesthetic” product of its
members is normally valued at zero, treated
indeed as mere dirt, which municipalities spend
millions of dollars cleaning up. Inside it is differentiated into schools and methods, provided
with its own peculiar art-historical terminology.
By the mere fact of its existence on the blank
expensive surfaces of the city, it constitutes a
critique of the world of property which cultivates,
possesses, and values forms of art in which the
graffiti community, though violently critical of that
overbearing world, are no more interested than
Chinweiza is in Sartre or Aristophanes.
We can make certain inferences from Smith’s
attitude to Chinweiza’s preferences, and from the
existence of an organized Subculture of graffiti.
First, it is surely intelligible and acceptable that
there should coexist cultures of opposition, each
with its own Canon and its own kind of commentary. I take this to be a firm, not a soppy,
liberal attitude, and find support, though at a
remove, in some remarks of Bernard Williams
on the claim of another philosopher that “a
properly untendentious description of the world
would not mention any values, that our values
are in some sense imposed or projected on to our
surroundings.” “That discovery,” says Williams,
“if that is what it is, can be met with despair, as
can the loss of a teleologically significant world.
But it can also be seen as a liberation, and a
radical form of freedom may be found in the fact
that we cannot be forced by the world to accept
one set of values rather than another” (Williams,
1985, p. 128).
Much depends, of course, on that parenthetical “if that is what it is,” and also on whether
it is true that “we cannot be forced.” Even so,
those who, like the friend cited by Williams’s
friend, find that they can “survive on a diet of
masterpieces,” need complain of no shortage
of food, and if others prefer not to call them
masterpieces, or would rather reserve that kind
of praise for their own kind of thing, pop songs
or horror movies or Zane Grey novels, that
should be all right with those who enjoy a diet
of masterpieces and equally all right with the
fans of Zane Grey. Each party, it may be said,
imposes or projects different values on the world.
There are rock classics and horror movie classics,

707
project is certainly political, for it is to take over
the institution, the institution being regarded as
an important instrument of social and political
power. The new regime will still have a canon
because the old one is held to have been successfully authoritarian and therefore a good model.
The new canon will be supported by methods
based on those which, as it was argued, made
the old one oppressive. Nor can it be seriously
maintained that absolutely no canonical directives
would be issued, for every reading list is a canon
of sorts.
Generally speaking, such arguments make
literary value entirely contingent on the political
preferences of the evaluator. A subtler argument,
favored by some Marxists, maintains that the
value of a particular text must be sought in the
relationship between that text and its concealed
ideological context – that is, in the non dit and
its relation to what it actually said. However,
that argument rests on the assumption that what
is “not said” must invariably be ideological. This
is an assumption that readers of poetry in any
language may wish to dispute. To accept it is to
accept that literary value resides in a “political
Unconscious” which the ingenious analytical
labors of the commentator can penetrate; he
or she will then discourse on the transactions
between this unconscious and the conscious
text. This gives ideology its proper importance,
but it does not seem greatly to clarify the issue
of value. We learn that value is dynamic, transactional, contingent, and must be sought by
analysis of a more subtle and extensive sort than
was envisaged by, say, Ellis, with his valuediscovering descriptions. It reinforces the notion
that the problem cannot properly be stated in such
exclusively literary terms, terms which ignore its
full dimension. It begs the question by assuming
a priori, in what can only be a demonstration of
false consciousness, the existence of autonomous
literary value.
Victims of their own unconscious ideologies,
literary persons may nevertheless want to approach the issue of value in terms not prescribed
by those who pity or despise them. They might
recall what may be described as an axiological
locus classicus in one of their canonical texts,
Shakspeare’s Troilus and Cressida (ll.ii). The scene
in a way balances one in the previous act, when
the Greek commanders had a long and useless

value in literature

also an ample diet and amply financed, for those
who choose it.
However, that way of talking fails to answer the
charge that the diet of masterpieces is provided
by a kitchen that dispenses oppression to others,
as when the police would like to get their hands
on the graffiti writers. More generally, the educational system which, at higher levels, serves or
has served the masterpiece lovers rather than
the connoisseurs of graffiti, is weighted against
the projections of the less powerful – blacks,
women, the young – to whom our way of doing
things can look like colonial exploitation. There,
for instance, are the young, already with their own
culture of television and folk rock and comic
books, an innocent tribe to which institutionalized elders bring their pseudoreligions, their
values, their canonical books, which are alien
and possibly even corrupting; it is as if, in
exploiting them, the powerful also gave them
their intellectual and aesthetic diseases, harmless
to the donors, perhaps fatal to them. It is her sympathy with this kind of argument that induces
Smith to categorize Chinweiza’s remark as
genuine evaluative conflict and Hume’s as illicit
and oppressive. If she had given unbiased thought
to Chinweiza she might have noticed that his
attitude mirrors the very attitudes of which she
complains, in omitting serious comment on what
is rejected, and in attempting to set up a rival
canonical Hegemony.
The graffiti writers are a little different, presumably having formed no intention to take
over politically; but even their kind of protest
seems to require a variety of institutional support
– the continuance of their art has called for
and gained the support of their own organized
scholarship and commentary. And of course
their institution and their culture are parasitic
upon the larger apparatus in which they exist by
defacing. Literary revolutionaries are less willing
to accept that their kind of thing can coexist
with the official culture; like Chinweiza, they
want to heave white male writers out of their way,
and seek to promote a black canon, a feminist
canon, anyway a new canon, proclaiming quite
openly the need to overthrow the institutional
canons and replace them with something else
they find more congenial politically. The project
may seem extravagant and implausible, but then
revolutionary programs tend to look like that. The

value in literature

708
debate about why, after seven years of war, they
had achieved none of their aims. They attributed
this failure to a dereliction from the values of
a transcendentally ordained hierarchical system.
Now we hear the Trojan leaders considering
whether they should go on with a war that they
too are finding unsatisfactory and costly. The
Greeks have proposed a straight deal: hand Helen
over and there will be no further demands; the
war can stop. Priam asks Hector for his views, and
Hector gives it as his opinion that the Greek
terms should be accepted. The war has already cost
a deal of blood; the Trojans have lost a tenth of
their men, all “to guard a thing not ours nor worth
to us . . . the value of one [life].” He can see no
merit “in that reason which denies / The yielding of her up.” Troilus replies:
Fie, fie, my brother!
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
So great as our dread father’s in a scale
Of common ounces?

It is goldsmith’s talk, and it is not about weighing Helen’s worth, but Priam’s – that is, Priam’s
honor. Another brother, the priest Helenus,
replies that their father surely ought to be reasonable, and not like Troilus. Troilus answers
this with contempt: it is reasonable, he points out,
to run away from danger, reason is the enemy
of honor, to be reasonable in this matter, as in
war, is to be dishonored. But Hector brings the
discussion back to the simple issue of economic
value: “Brother, she is not worth what she doth
cost / The keeping.” Whereupon Troilus introduces more abstract axiological considerations.
“What is aught but as ’tis valued?” he asks, and
Hector answers:
But value dwells not in particular will;
It holds his estimate and dignity
As well wherein ’tis precious of itself
As in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry
To make the service greater than the god;
And the will dotes that is attributive
To what infectiously itself affects,
Without some image of the affected merit.

In other words, there is intrinsic value (in Helen’s
case very small) as well as the value imparted to
an object by a “prizer.” The will that supposes its

own desire for an object to be the sole source of
its value, believing that this desire is not itself
influenced by a preunderstanding of the inherent
merit of the thing desired, is simply narcissistic
stupidity. Troilus answers this argument of
Hector’s with a parable: if today he were to
marry a wife – a choice guided by his will (a word
at this time often almost synonymous with
“desire”) – he could not honorably dispose of
her if later his will should come to “distaste what
it elected.” The Trojans gained the incomparable
Helen in exchange for “an old aunt.”
Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.
Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl,
Whose price hath launch’d above a thousand ships
And turn’d crown’d kings to merchants.
If you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom Paris went –
As you must needs, for you all cried “go, go” –
If you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize –
As you must needs, for you all clapp’d your hands,
And cried “Inestimable!” – why do you now
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
And do a deed that never fortune did,
Beggar the estimation which you priz’d
Richer than sea or land?

The economic pull on this discussion is obvious.
Hector associates value with the word “estimate,”
and though the hendiadys suggests that “dignity”
and “estimate” are not easily separated, he also
speaks of things as being precious in themselves
as well as in the “prizer,” the appraiser. Troilus
uses the same sort of language but on the other
side of the case, and without conceding that
value dwells elsewhere than in particular will:
Helen, he says, is a pearl of price, a worthy
prize, inestimable. “Estimation” and “prize” are
repeated, and it seems that for Troilus the argument comes down to this: once one has agreed
to place a high value on an object, it will be a
diminution not of the value of the object but of
one’s own worth to seek to devalue it, to “beggar
the estimation which you prized” so highly.
Some of the attributed value sticks to the object,
though it will be calculated in terms of a loss
of personal worth in the prizer who changes his
mind or will or desire.
When Cassandra interrupts the discussion
Hector asks whether her dire divinations might
persuade Troilus to be more reasonable. However,

709
economy, determined by the worth one attributes to oneself, which, as the language of the play
repeatedly informs us, must ultimately depend on
what others think about one; it is thus dependent
on opinion, and evaluated by such essentially
irrational criteria as military courage. Value is
strictly a matter of opinion, of doxa, not of truth;
the valuation of an object depends on a complex
of superstitions and ideological constraints.
Troilus’s position is complicated by many
allusions to taste and distaste, all increasing the
weight of the notion that the choice, by will or
desire, of the valued object is a matter of the lower
senses, taste and touch (even as he speaks he is
in a ferment of desire for Cressida), yet not subject to revision when those senses are satisfied; it
would be dishonorable, a loss of personal worth,
to allow mere disrelish to alter a valuation once
made, however transient its basis. (Later he
discovers that although he is “true” – constant to
the choice he willed – Cressida is not; she is an
advocate of contingency.) Hector’s economy is
different. From a reasonable view, he thinks,
there is a discrepancy between Helen’s value,
at any rate at the moment, and her cost, and he
argues the Trojans should cut their losses. His
point about the law of nature and nations comes
in largely as an afterthought.
As often in Shakespeare, we find that much
of the effect derives not from overt argument
but from the insistence of a special vocabulary:
worth, worthy, unworthy, estimation, estimate,
inestimable, prize, price, pearl, opinion, truth,
honor. The scene cannot offer, any more than
we can, a definite solution to the problem of
value it raises; it merely shows how complicated
it must be in the particular case considered, how
dependent on prior and unquestioned assumptions; and it ends with the ostensibly more
commonsensical and influential debater, the
advocate of rationality, weakly giving up. The
questions simply spread out like a stain; the value
of Helen is a matter inseparable from the worth
and dignity of Priam, and so forth. That kings
become merchants for her sake is meant to be a
compliment, though it could be read otherwise.
Other characters in the play go to some trouble
to show us that Helen is not, in the sense of the
word they accept, worth very much, and is herself, no more than Cressida, “honorable” – honor
being, as applied to women, entirely a matter of

value in literature

Troilus replies, quite reasonably, that considerations of success or failure make no difference to
his position, which it would be a loss of honor,
of personal worth, to give up. This point is
endorsed by Paris, who says his reason for wanting to keep Helen is not that he enjoys sleeping
with her; the reason is that for the family of Priam
to give her back would constitute a derogation
from their “great worths.” Hector then remarks
magisterially that Troilus and Paris argue like
young men whose reason is so dominated by
passion that they cannot tell right from wrong.
He adds that Helen’s first contractual duty is, by
the law of nature and of nations, to her deserted
husband, the implication being that, if there
seems to be a question of the Trojans losing
personal value, they should reflect that they have
done so already by their original interference
with the husband’s right. If Helen means a loss
of face, that loss was suffered long ago when she
was kidnapped, and it makes no sense to fear that
the loss could be repeated if they let Helen go.
Hector then brings the argument to a sudden
end by simply giving in, saying that although
he has expressed his opinion “in way of truth,”
he accepts after all that their dignities depend on
their keeping Helen. It is a strange submission,
unnecessarily conceding or appropriating the
arguments he has been resisting, as if the whole
thing had been a merely academic debate in
which he defended a cause not really his. Of
course he had to give in, after all the war did
continue, but we are far from persuaded that the
other side had the best of the argument, which,
like the one in the Greek camp, remains without
satisfactory resolution; everything went on just
as before, or worse than before, as if these discussions of degree and value were, as I have
said, merely academic, as if everybody’s business,
namely war and politics and sex, was essentially,
as Thersites keeps on saying, a matter of vanity
and ambition to which ethical considerations
did not apply except hypocritically, or perhaps
academically.
One curious aspect of this unique scene is
that until the law is mentioned at the end of it,
there is no attempt to refer to any transcendent
System or sanction of value other than an
institutional and unexamined code of honor or
“dignity” or “worth.” Troilus is clear that the
value of anything depends upon a purely human

value in literature

710
chastity and fidelity, to be lost in a moment.
This is of course important, for the women also
have exchange value, and are used as commercial
counters, Helen in exchange for an aunt (Troilus
thinks this a real bargain), Cressida for Antenor
(Troilus likes this deal much less). These women
could be called passive victims of rape, Helen
snatched from her husband for Paris, Cressida
forced into the Greek camp for use by Diomedes;
and rape, by violating female honor, is, on the
prevailing system, a destroyer of value. Women
are not “precious in themselves,” though their
beauty may create an appearance to the contrary; their value lies in what men think about
them, that is, in opinion.
Economies and polities are fueled by opinion.
It seems from the Shakespearean debate that
this position, possibly modified by some idea of
things as precious in themselves – truly precious
– was held in the sixteenth century, and we seem
to be in much the same position, differently
described, at present. We behave in the ordinary
way as if things were capable of being precious
in themselves, though admitting, on reflection, that
opinion, which includes self-esteem, governs all
valuations. We will further allow that it cannot
be merely one’s own private opinion that does
so; for that opinion will be affected by tacit or
explicit agreements within our particular community. A great many people place a high value,
and spend a great deal of money, on automobile
number plates with distinctive characteristics of
one sort or another; or on vintage cars or matchboxes or stamps. Many more do not, but this does
not affect the devotees’ notion of their value,
which is reflected in the price they, unlike most
other people, would be willing to pay for them.
Of other things it is possible to say they had a value
before they were traded; gold, obviously, had
useful properties such as ductility, a capacity
to form useful alloys, and so forth, which are
intrinsic and not dependent on the fluctuating
price at which it is traded; and those who
exchange it probably have, somewhere in their
heads, what Hector called “some image of
th’affected merit.” A “fine” piece of eighteenthcentury furniture, worth thousands of pounds,
is also called valuable because of the way it is made,
the combination of woods, the elegance of the
design and the workmanship of the marquetry
or whatever. These qualities contribute to the

exchange value of the auction room but exist
independently of it, and it is hard to think that
anybody who cared about how others valued
them would profess to believe that as between such
a piece and some piece of modern plastic junk
furniture the difference of value, as distinct from
price, was merely a matter of opinion; nor would
the question value for what or in what contingency
be very sensible, since it hardly needs saying that
the value of the eighteenth-century chest is zero
if it is judged by its usefulness as a chest; it will
be too valuable for daily use.
Of course the quasi-inherent value of such a
thing is much more evident to an expert than
to the uninformed passerby, and the expert may
be thought to confer its “attributive” value, his
image of the affected merit being so much
sharper than the ignorant glance could achieve.
Here we may attend again to our supposedly
wicked ways with literature. It is a simple truth
that the more you know about a particular kind
of thing, the better able you are to appraise, prize,
estimate its wood, its design, its marquetry, and
its place among other artifacts of a similar kind.
This is true also of “canonical” literature; the
expression implies not only a favored view of a
particular work, but also the membership of that
work in a larger group of works also esteemed.
To believe that canons are in themselves oppressive, that oppression is a constitutive element in
canons, you must have a false image of them. This
is not to say that the attributive value of their contents is one that everybody is abliged to accept.
If people want to know about them because they
have heard that they too can acquire an image
of their merit, they can do so without coercion,
just as they may in respect of matchboxes and
rock music. Anybody with teaching experience
will know that you can no more force unwilling
students to place a high value on canonical
works of literature, to gain the knowledge necessary to that act, than you can persuade me, if
I am unwilling, to place a high value on rare
stamps or matchboxes.
What, to put the matter at its lowest, are the
benefits of knowing something about a literary
canon, in something the same way as experts
know a lot about, and many examples of,
Chippendale furniture? The fact is that you must
know about a great many interrelated things
to value any one thing, and the benefits accruing

Italian philosopher and cultural theorist, associated chiefly
with the postmodern (counter-Enlightenment)
turn in recent philosophical thought. Vattimo is
cheerfully eclectic in his range of sources, drawing upon Hegel, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, the
later Heidegger, a selective (not to say opportunist) reading of Derrida, and also on the
strain of neopragmatist (or “Postanalytic”)
philosophy exemplified by Richard Rorty. From
these he derives the idea of “weak thinking”
(pensiero debole), a thinking that on principle
renounces such Enlightenment values as truth,
reason, critique, dialectics, argumentative validity, etc. Much better, he urges, that we should
henceforth cultivate the postmodern virtue – the
philosophic line of least resistance – which aims
at a broad-based pluralist consensus beyond
such obsolete and pointless grounds of dispute.
He therefore subscribes to a version of the End

portentous than Heidegger’s depth-ontological
brooding on the epochal closure of Western
metaphysics.

`Venturi, Robert (1925–) 
American architect
and author of two influential studies of modern
architecture. In the first study, Complexity and
Contradiction in Architecture (1966), Venturi finds
that many modern architects have come to
blindly idealize simplicity, accepting Ludwig Mies
van der Rohe’s epigrammatic statement about
his own work – “less is more” – as a guiding principle of architectural design. Venturi responds
to this with his counterepigram – “less is a bore”

Venturi, Robert

from that knowledge are palpable, even if they
include an element of self-esteem. Readers who
know the works of Wallace Stevens – his “canon”
– in some depth will understand some of the late
short poems – like “The planet on the table” or
“Of mere being” – as valuable or “great” poems,
while those who come upon them in isolation may
see them as rather trivial. The phenomenon is
equally familiar in canons more largely conceived.
The point is simple: that membership of a
corpus of poetry affects the value of the components as perceived by those who know the
corpus, though not by those who ignore it. This
observation applies to canons of greater extent.
It says more about how canons work than it does
about the intrinsic value of their constituents,
but it does also say that valuations vary not
only with varying degrees of knowledge of a
particular object but also with varying degrees
of knowledge of a canonical context; and it also
implies that it is wrong to complain that the
higher valuations come from an economically
privileged group. The privilege derives from
knowledge, not money. It is simply a group that
knows more about this poetry, and perhaps
about poetry in general, as some know more
about graffiti or B movies. This is the difference
between those who have an image of the affected
merit and those who have not; and there seems
little reason why those who have should worry
about the strictures of the others, or envy them
the merits they may prefer to affect. Like Bernard
Williams, we should rejoice in such freedom
rather than yield to despair.
Admittedly this fails to answer the big question,
in what sense is there merit independent of
effect, or whether you can have one without the
other. Although they do seem to go together, we
habitually speak of them as distinct, entertaining
the notion of a good picture we do not actually
like, liking objects we would, if pressed, admit not
to have much merit, and so on. And it cannot be
without importance that we all know how to use
appropriate, inexact language about the value
of artifacts when talking informally, careless of
the constraints imposed by considerations of
axiology, or even of postaxiology.

– arguing instead for a richness and exuberance
in architectural expression, like that frequently
found in examples of Mannerist, baroque, and
Rococo architecture. Venturi also suggests at the
conclusion of this study that the vitality of main
street and commercial strips could be a source
of ideas for architects, as it had been for artists
associated with the Pop art movement. In his
second study, Learning from Las Vegas: The
Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form 1972
(1977), written with Denise Brown and Steven
Izenour, Venturi examines in detail the landscape of the main street, and particularly of a strip,
in Las Vegas, a small City which presents an
exaggerated picture of urban signage and sprawl.
The parking lots and billboards, the service
stations and fastfood restaurants, the hotels and
casinos of Las Vegas provide an ideal Text for
Venturi to analyze the “messy vitality” that he
prefers in the experience of architecture to an
“obvious unity.” An important lesson learned
from this text is that ordinary buildings with
explicit ornament attached to them – the “decorated shed” – serve architecture and the modern
experience better than the “high art” modern
architecture, which treats the whole structure as
an expressive ornament. Venturi puts this lesson
in the language of literary theory, pointing out
that modern architecture has tended to ignore
Denotation, which applied ornament can provide, and has emphasized Connotation, which
transforms buildings into big ornaments. So
Venturi gives a new and unexpected twist to the
meaning of Adolph Loos’s statement that the
“ornament is crime.” Venturi has used the lessons
of Las Vegas and the ideas of Complexity
and Contradiction in his own architectural
practice from, for example, the Guild House,
Philadelphia, 1960–3, to the Sainsbury Wing,
National Gallery, London, 1989–91. The oversized
and nonfunctional television antenna on top of
the Guild House serves as a sculptural Symbol of
the activity which is important in the lives of the
elderly residents of this building. The colossal
applied columns which are spaced at increasing
intervals along the facade of the Sainsbury Wing
act as symbolic Signs that link this extension
to the colonnade and applied pilasters of the
main structure, as well as to nearby Nelson’s
Column. The Guild House and the Sainsbury
Wing show the development of Venturi’s work,

and also illustrate the shifting currents and tastes
in architecture from the 1960s to the 1990s.
Venturi is no longer an architect of regional
interest, but one of international importance;
and he is no longer reviled as a “Pop architect,”
but respected as a founding father of postmodern architecture.

`Victorian studies 
At the most basic level,
Victorian studies describes a field of study –
that is, the literature and culture, both broadly
defined, of the period of Queen Victoria’s reign
in England (1837–1901) – and a methodology
grounded in interdisciplinarity and indebted to,
if not rooted in, Cultural studies. The nearly
simultaneous publication of the first issue of the
journal Victorian Studies in 1957 and Raymond
Williams’s Culture and Society 1780–1950 in
1958 mark the beginning of Victorian studies
as an interdisciplinary field that reconceives culture along Marxist lines and with an emphasis
on historicism and identity at once. Victorian
studies is so frequently seen to overlap with
cultural studies that the labels are often conflated into Victorian cultural studies: indeed,
when scholars articulate the object of Victorian
studies, they inevitably announce their intention
to consider all aspects of culture, high and low,
and the products of an array of disciplines.
Marking the fiftieth anniversary of Victorian
Studies, the journal’s founders recalled their
original aims: “what seemed to us most likely
to be helpful was a journal that crossed disciplinary lines and integrated methodologies and
subject matters in the hope of evoking a broad,
human understanding of the era . . . ” (Appleman et al., 1956, p. 10). Transcending disciplinary

713
Several scholars in recent years have sought
to defend interdisciplinarity against critiques like
Loesberg’s or the more practical criticism that the
scholar who straddles multiple fields cannot be
an expert in each field she addresses. Kate Flint
(2000), for instance, describes “contact zones,”
places where different disciplines meet and where
the challenges of achieving expertise in multiple
disciplines are mitigated by the “energy and
dialogue” of bringing those disciplines into contact (p. 510). Similarly, some scholars have noted
that the Victorians themselves were disinclined to
categorize their culture according to disciplinary
boundaries; thus, in adopting an interdisciplinary
approach to their age, scholars follow the model
well established in such seminal periodical publications of the nineteenth century as the Quarterly
Review and the popular Chamber’s Journal, or even
that great catalogue of the mid century, the
catalogue of the Great Exhibition.
Postcolonial studies broadened the geographic
boundaries of Victorian studies, as scholars began
to investigate the cultural and literary productions
of the broader English-speaking world. Most
of these studies, however, continued to focus
attention on the British Empire and its colonies.
More recently, critics such as Amanda Claybaugh
and Sharon Marcus have called for a breakdown of the national boundaries that define the
period, an interdisciplinarity, rooted in comparative literature, that broadens Victorian studies to
include or at least engage with American Studies.
Claybaugh asserts that issues that have been
central to the study of Victorian literature and culture, such as social reform, demand a transatlantic
approach. She writes, “the Anglo-American
scope of social reform points to the need for a
transatlanticism that is as attentive to the connections across national boundaries as to the
differences between nations” (Claybaugh, 2006,
p. 438). At the 2008 meeting of the NAVSA,
Claybaugh acknowledged that this transatlanticism
faces serious obstacles in the administrative facts
of curricular design and hiring practices: universities hire a Victorianist and an Americanist and
assign each of them to teach different courses
and work with different students. This practical
challenge exemplifies the difficulty of organizational
and intellectual change. Nonetheless, Claybaugh
exhorts scholars of the nineteenth century to find
ways to set aside the national designations.

Victorian studies

borders, traditional definitions of culture, and
canons of art and literature characterizes late
twentieth-century investigations of the Victorian
period.
Interdisciplinarity is one of the earliest and
most persistent aspects of Victorian studies, even
as the definition of the term has proved elusive
and even controversial. Catherine Gallagher
(2005, p. 253) points out that the use of the label
“studies” signals that the field draws on a variety
of disciplines, and she notes that the label rises
out of the vocabulary of academic departments
and interdisciplinary programs. Thus, a scholar
might produce a straightforward analysis of a
canonical Victorian novel, but under the heading of “Victorian studies” that analysis, not at
all interdisciplinary in itself, participates in
an interdisciplinary discourse. Of course, much
work labeled Victorian studies does draw upon
multiple disciplines, including the work of
scholars applying literary analysis to non-literary
texts. Jonathan Loesberg (1999, p. 538) labels
such work “intellectual imperialism” and identifies new historicist Stephen Greenblatt as the
key figure in the turn of literary analysis to nonliterary material: “The new historicists, or at least
Stephen Greenblatt, . . . claim[ed] that the connecting system binding discourses into a culture,
the form of a culture, could be read in literary
terms” (Loesberg, 1999, p. 540). This view enables
the literary critic to read any cultural product as
a text, and thus texts previously associated with
specific disciplines became unmoored from their
origins and available to literary scholars as morsels
of discourse. Catherine Gallagher (2005, p. 254)
echoes Loesberg in her observation that literary
scholars are “too often being interdisciplinary all
by [them]selves.” Loesberg (1999, p. 537) argues
instead for a “genuine interdisciplinarity,” which
he describes as “the participation of scholars from
different disciplines with different and possibly
conflicting grounding questions, concerns and
modes of analysis in the study of the same subject matter.” While Victorian Studies and its
partner association, the North American Victorian
Studies Association (NAVSA), do not seem ready
to discard the literary approach to multiple disciplines, they do follow Loesberg, Gallagher, and
others in actively calling for scholars from an
array of disciplines to participate in the discourse they sponsor.

Victorian studies

714
Interdisciplinary, cultural, and transatlantic
studies together have seemed at odds with formalism and the mid-twentieth-century work of
the New Critics; however, recent assessments of
Victorian studies have articulated the continued
value and even urgent need for formal analysis
alongside cultural analysis, what Herbert Tucker
(1999, p. 534) calls “neoformalism.” For some
scholars, attention to formal textual elements
is a response to the accusation of “intellectual
imperialism” leveled by Loesberg. A literary
scholar may claim ownership of a text that is more
obviously situated within the purview of a different
discipline if the approach to that text is undeniably literary: in other words, the scholar who
analyzes Freud’s use of simile is not colonizing
a psychological text, but instead is finding the
literary in that text.
Other scholars use formal analysis to ground
cultural analysis, using close attention to diction
or prosody to support an argument about faith,
gender, or science. Tucker (1999, p. 533) demonstrates the cultural neoformalism he describes in
“The fix of form: an open letter” with a metrical
analysis of the stanza from In Memoriam from
which he borrows his title:
O thou that after toil and storm
Mayst seem to have reached a purer air,
Whose faith has centre everywhere,
Nor cares to fix itself to form. . . .

Tucker observes that Tennyson, like the practitioner
of neoformalist analysis within Victorian studies,
establishes a complex relationship between an
abstract element of culture, in this case “faith,”
and the concrete business of form. Tucker elaborates as he attends to the extra syllable of the
stanza’s second line: he argues that two possible
scansions represent two different dialects (p. 535).
He concludes, “To audition these possible speakers
and their diverse subcultural allegiances is to hear
the spirit of the age in a puff of breath, ventilating for a prosodically amplified moment questions
of class and region that articulated nineteenthcentury Britain’s changing conception of itself”
(p. 535). Tucker’s use of formal analysis allows
him to range from an extra syllable to an apt
characterization of the Victorian age. Of course,
formal analyses like Tucker’s are generally the
products of literary scholars and may represent a

retreat from the call to interdisciplinary arms. For
this reason, interdisciplinary bodies like Victorian
Studies and NAVSA will continue to seek complements to neoformalism, wanting to set alongside analyses like Tucker’s the works of scholars
from many other disciplines, scholars who may
agree that culture does not care to fix itself to form.
The close attention to the minute elements
of text, however, has been matched with a close
attention to the minute elements of culture:
material things. Victorian studies has increasingly
turned to material analyses with contributions
from scholars in a range of disciplines. Recent
work on commodity culture, sound recording,
spectacle, and visual imagination (see Richards,
1991; Flint, 2000; Secord, 2001; Picker, 2003) has
placed material culture at the heart of Victorian
studies. Indeed, there is an analogous relation
between the study of form and the study of the
material: both focus on something precise and well
defined that becomes synecdochic of larger cultural
matters. Thus the turn to material culture and the
turn to formalism seem to address the same
need. In the morass of interdisciplinary study of
a period whose dates are ill defined and a culture
whose geographic boundaries have grown elusive,
there is a compelling need to base the study of
culture in something concrete, whether a syllable,
a soap advertisement, or a wax cylinder.
As the study of material culture has boomed,
so, too, has the study of print culture. Attention
to the publishing industry and the periodical
press is not new, but the urgency of the new work
in these areas is notable. Books and periodicals
are themselves things, and studying the production of them and the relationship between their
material qualities and their content has become
a significant subfield within Victorian studies.
This has led to studies of serial publishing, social
networks and the periodical press, and advances
in paper-making technology, to name only a few
areas of study. The new emphasis on material print
culture in Victorian studies owes a tremendous
debt to advances in technology in our own age:
digital archives have made accessible a wealth
of material previously available only to scholars
located near select libraries or with the resources
to travel to them. The extraordinary availability
of so many nineteenth-century texts, images,
and ephemera has led to what some have called
the democratization of Victorian studies.

`virtual music 
Virtual music is an inclusive term
applied to all forms of music on the Internet; it
refers to everything from a singer-songwriter’s
demo on MySpace or a band’s mp3 files on
iTunes, to soundtracks for websites and worldwide community art projects that live and grow
online, all collectively defining and redefining
as they expand and transform, not merely the
role, but, in reality, the very nature of music
as it will become in the twenty-first century. To
echo Dutch architect Rem Koolhass’s definition of “the virtual” – anything that does not
result in mass – virtual music is music that exists
online in the digital realm, without physical
substance, but with the ability to spread the
sounds of the world worldwide, effortlessly and
instantaneously.
The commercial aspects of virtual music –
that is, the selling of music online by everyone from
individuals to multinational corporations – is a
fascinating story, one filled with unprecedented
opportunities, as well as miscalculations and
major blunders. It is a story that has altered the
business of music in fundamental ways, but it
is a story for another time. Here we will explore
the act and the art of creating music online – music
never before possible, made with new resources
in new venues for audiences unavailable before
the advent of the web. This is also a place to
speculate about the scope and future of this
new music and to offer the observation that
some forms of music on the Internet will be
both continuous and regenerative, created in
community in ways not yet imagined, much
less considered feasible. For if Canadian composer
and writer R. Murray Schaefer is right that the big
revolutions in music history come more from
changes of context rather than from changes in
style, then virtual music surely represents such
an opportunity for significant change. At this
early point in the developmental process, of
course – barely beyond the first decade of music
online – no one really knows where this all
might lead.

virtual music

With resources such as Google Books and
NINES: Nineteenth Century Studies Online,
scholars all over the world can use the Internet to
access the primary material of Victorian studies.
NINES, in particular, rewrites the landscape of
Victorian studies, affecting what may come to be
seen as a paradigm shift in the study of Victorian
literature and culture. Describing the markup
language used in NINES, Dino Franco Felluga
(2006, p. 315) explains that it will “turn every user
of NINES into a contributor, someone whose
every interpretive ‘move’ is embodied in the system, ready for reuse and continued interpretation.”
Thus, the searches and queries of scholars of
Victorian studies are now embedded in the very
texts they study, expanding the field to include not
only the period 1837–1901 and the range of the
British Empire (and beyond) but also the present
moment, twenty-first-century observations about
the Victorian period looping back and becoming
a piece of Victorian studies. With the coming of
the digital age, then, Victorian studies grows
ever richer and its boundaries ever more fluid.

virtual music

716
Where the Internet began, however, was in
stillness and in silence. Nothing moved; nothing made a sound. But somewhere between the
appearance of AOL (1985) and the release of
the Netscape Navigator browser (1994), it came
alive. In fact, as early as 1990, remote online
jamming became possible through NetJam, a
LISTSERV/Usenet group. These early collaborations on NetJam were asychronous, however,
and consisted of MIDI files sent by e-mail, downloaded, added to, and returned. While NetJam was
one of the first to make remote jamming on the
Internet a possibility, creating, as it did, a virtual
space in which musicians from around the world
could make music together, Rocket Network
(1994) took the more significant next step with
its Vortex Jamming software, which made online
collaboration appear to take place in real-time.
Early Internet sound was also improved upon considerably by Beatnik (1996), whose player and
editor software allowed music, sounds, and voices
to be woven into actual web pages. Designed
and maximized for the web, the Beatnik sound
engine became the standard for early online
companies such as Netscape, Oracle, Disney, and
MTV Online.
Because of the shift from LP recordings to
compact discs during the 1980s, digital sound had
already reached a higher level of development than
had other forms of digital art, such as gaming,
movies, and virtual reality. But the slow processing speeds of the web in the early 1990s made
music, with its large files of digital data, difficult
if not impossible to stream, much less manipulate successfully. By the mid-1990s, however,
new compression schemes (Real Audio and mp3,
among others) made the real-time streaming of
online music a reality. And shortly after that,
interactive art on the Internet – that is, art that
allows the user to become actively involved in the
process of creation – became a reality.
One of the first examples of this type of online
creative interaction was WebDrum (1997), a
multiplayer drum machine that accommodated
up to eight players per session, allowing them to
share in the editing of drum patterns, including the ability to control not only rhythm and
tempo, but pitch and tone color as well. The first
truly interactive work of music and art on the web,
however, was Cathedral (1997), a site of musical,
artistic, and text-based experiences, complete

with web-based musical instruments such as the
PitchWeb (with its scalable degrees of difficulty
and playable by anyone), and a Cathedral band
that gave performances bridging the virtual world
with the real by combining, in real time, online
PitchWeb players worldwide with a band on
stage, and with the entire collaboration webcast
live. From the beginning, Cathedral’s stated goal
was to create an imaginative, ongoing artistic
experience by blurring the distinctions separating
composers, performers, and audiences, and by
inviting everyone visiting the site to become a creative participant. In this sense, Cathedral became
an agreement of people to come together online
for the purpose of art, in a form that was indeterminate, asynchronous, and containing elements
of chance. In 2001, Cathedral produced a 48-hour
webcast streaming 34 concerts live from five
continents, the first festival of experimental music
on the web.
As generation upon generation of new websites, online musical instruments, and software
continued to bring forth new possibilities –
including, by 2003, the ability for a musician’s
avatar to book a venue, invite an audience, and
play a concert live in the online virtual world
of Second Life – it became possible to see that
this new virtual music of the future, emerging, as it was, from a new landscape of digital
instruments, techniques, and sound, was being
brought into being by the confluence of four
key factors: availability, portability, collectivity,
and communication. Already, it is obvious that
the tools of virtual music – particularly inexpensive computers, open-source software, and free
wi-fi – will continue to grow increasingly available to all. Within the past decade, for example,
online participation at the community level
has increased exponentially, not only in the
creating and sharing of playlists and podcasts,
but also in the development of the online social
networks, among them MySpace (2003), FaceBook (2004), Flickr (2004), YouTube (2005),
and Twitter (2006), all of which demonstrate
people’s inclination to become actively involved
online.
A second defining characteristic of virtual music
is portability. Today, wireless connectivity is taken
for granted, and this ability on the part of users
to engage regardless of location means that art
projects will be able to occur in open spaces,

717
As we go forward, the degree of distinction
between online art and online gaming may also
become increasingly blurred. Composers are
already writing music for mobile phones and
multiple Wii’s, and there is a global community
making music with Game Boy sounds, not to
mention Guitar Hero (2005), the popular home
entertainment video game that has made many
a teenage gamer more musical than they ever
intended to be. So in the not too distant future,
the opportunity exists that the online artistic
experience will become as entertaining, interactive, and engaging as the online gaming
experience, and as meaningful and thought
provoking as all good art.
More recently, and particularly in 2008 with the
acceptance of third-party applications for Apple’s
iPhone, a new generation of virtual musical
instruments are emerging. The earliest of these
iPhone instruments have names like Shaker,
AirDrum, PocketGuitar, and Harmonica (and yes,
you put the iPhone to your mouth to play it). But
others, such as Bloom and synthPond, are a new
breed of twenty-first-century musical instrument
that allow all of us to create beautiful sounds.
Ocarina, on the other hand, offers a flute that can
be played at home but heard around the world,
while RjDj surrounds us with the sounds of our
environment played back to us in altered form
as we go about our day.
The importance of apps such as these is that
in them we are seeing a second generation of
digital musical instruments, ones designed to
explore the future instead of struggling to extend
the past. For all their fun qualities, most music
apps developed to date have aspired to recreate
traditional sounds, even if in less than traditional
ways. But apps such as Bloom, synthPond,
Ocarina, and RjDj do something else – these are
new instruments, ones that anyone can play, and
that don’t look, sound, or handle like anything
familiar. More new instrument apps will come
along, many with better interfaces and expanded
features, making those available now appear to
be the first generation instruments that they are.
But in these current music apps we are getting a
glimpse of the future and an inkling of what the
global possibilities for making music really are.
The common theme running throughout this
scenario, of course, is the emergence of a new
type of artistic information exchange, one that

virtual music

over wide distances, and have the ability to
change location as they unfold.
A third critical component of this new music
is the sheer numbers of participants who will
be involved, and the power that this connected
and technically savvy mass of people will be able
to evoke. Consider, for example, the possibility that
virtual music has the potential to become a live
musical organism, living online, growing and
changing course because of the collective actions
of its users, and we get a glimpse of where
virtual music may be headed and what it may
encounter along the way.
The fourth element helping to shape virtual
music is communication. For us today, at the earliest stages of Internet artistry, the question is: how
might these new forms of musical interactivity
affect the very idea of musical communication,
and how might new ways develop that will allow
amateurs and professionals, not only to coexist
online, but also to enjoy the shared experience of
creating? In this type of participatory environment, after all, creativity is not isolated in one
or two individuals, but is distributed uniformly
throughout the network. So for the first time, there
exists a universal form of music that has the
ability to draw in and engage its listeners in the
creative process, and to decentralize the act of
creating music.
As music on the web moves forward the
fundamental characteristics of the music itself
are emerging. First – and, most importantly, for
the first time – virtual music is a decentralized,
universal art form: anyone with a computer and
Internet access may be involved, despite their
location in physical space. Second, this form of
music is participatory; people can alter it in ways
that they, as well as everyone else, can hear. And
because virtual music is interactive, it can contribute to its own development, a process easier
to characterize with neurological or biological
metaphors, rather than with traditionally musical, mechanical, or mathematical ones. Equally
important is the fact that the content of virtual
music is inclusive, not exclusionary. There is no
one predominant or acceptable method, sound,
style, set of instruments, or performing environment for the web – and there probably never
will be. On the Internet, there is room for all; the
possibilities appear endless; the future of the web
is filled with sound.

Voloshinov, Valentin Nikolaevich

emphasizes process and encourages non-flowing
musical time. Because without a fixed beginning,
middle, or end, virtual music is free from the constraints of time, offering a continually evolving,
always available, environment in which listeners
are free to enter at any point, explore in multiple
directions, and contribute to the shape and
character of the music as they go. Furthermore,
this opening up of the development of a work
of art to multiple influences will contribute an
important new thread to the fabric of what it
means to be a composer, for, without question,
these ongoing, online, group compositions will take
on a personality of their own as the communities around which they develop grow. As for the

future of virtual music, certainly, as creative
artists, active users, and passive listeners, we
must all stay open to the possibility that the way
we make art, perceive music, and participate
as audiences will be changing significantly in the
coming years.

`Waley, Arthur (1889–1966) 
Arthur Waley’s
deft, lucid, and widely read English translations were, to a significant extent, responsible
for the surge of interest in and exposure to the
national literatures of China and Japan that
occurred in the first half of the twentieth century.
An autodidact who mastered both classical and
colloquial Chinese and Japanese without the
benefit of either formal training or having ever
visited either country, Waley was the first translator to provide English-reading audiences with
consistently accurate and stylistically evocative
translations of important foundational literary
works of China and Japan, including anthologies
of Chinese poetry (concentrating primarily on
works prior to and through the Tang dynasty),
Ndh dramas, an immensely popular and influential
translation of The Tale of Genji, the Analects of
Confucius, the Tao Te Ching, and the Chinese
novel Monkey.
Born Arthur David Schloss, the son of a wellto-do economist on the Board of Trade, Waley
adopted his paternal grandmother’s maiden
name in 1914 at the age of 25. Educated at Rugby
School – where he first encountered many of the
friends and acquaintances he would continue to
associate with for decades at the edges of the
Bloomsbury Group – he entered King’s College,
Cambridge in 1907, where he studied Classics,
graduating in 1910. His education at both Rugby
and Cambridge provided the intense and rigorous training in classical philology and literary

scholarship that later served as the foundation for
his approach to translating East Asian texts. It was
that combination of philological rigor informed
by a refined stylistic and aesthetic sensibility
that distinguished his translations from those
Western audiences had previously encountered,
and in effect, they set a standard that equaled
or exceeded any literary translations extant at
that time.
Hired as an assistant curator in the Print Room
of the British Museum in 1913, Waley first
encountered Asian languages and art when he
was transferred to the Oriental Section under
the tutelage of the renowned Asianist Laurence
Binyon, who gave his young charge the formidable task of cataloguing the newly received cache
of Buddhist paintings and manuscripts “retrieved”
from the Dun-Huang caves in northwest China
by Sir Aurel Stein. This textual encounter proved
to be the seminal moment of Waley’s creative
life, as he embarked upon a lifelong study and
mastery of classical Chinese and Japanese – completing a series of remarkably reliable and elegant
translations of important works in the sequence
he encountered them, resulting, by the end of his
life, in over 35 full-length works of translation
in addition to a large body of scholarly articles
and monographs.
A lifelong resident of Gordon Square, Waley
remained at the British Museum for almost two
decades (1913–30) during which he produced
his first works of translation, One Hundred and

Waley, Arthur

Seventy Chinese Poems (1918) and More Translations (1919). These earliest attempts reveal
Waley’s predisposition as a philologist interested
in providing accurate literary introductions to
those whom, he assumed, would naturally wish
to pursue the texts in their original language.
These early Chinese translations proved to be
quite popular and were widely disseminated
– certainly encountered by Ezra Pound, whose
critical response was ambivalent (the notion
that Pound was responsible either for Waley’s
interest in Chinese poetry or for any subsequent
publication of his early translations has proven
false). It was also during this time at the British
Museum that Waley began his Japanese scholarship and translations, beginning with the anthology Japanese Poetry: The Uta (1919) followed by
The NDh Plays of Japan (1921).
While these works were not met with the
positive critical reception enjoyed by the earlier
Chinese poetry translations, this period marked
the beginning of his monumental multivolume
translation of Lady Murasaki’s seventh-century
masterpiece, The Tale of Genji (1921–33), which
had an intense and enduring effect upon artistic
sensibilities within the Bloomsbury circle and
eventually established Waley as the most influential and widely read interpreter of Asian literature and culture in the first half of the twentieth
century. The broad and positive reception to
Genji was intensified by the collective realization that the elegant and rarified sensibilities
of the cloistered Japanese Heian court portrayed
in the work represented a culture far more
sophisticated and advanced than any existing in
seventh-century Europe. Added to this realization
was the fact that the work represented, by an
advance of over 1,000 years, the first appearance
of what could clearly be characterized as a “novel”
in the West, and with a female author.
With the brief exception of service as a censor
in the Ministry of Information during the Second
World War, Waley was able to devote the rest
of his life, after leaving the British Museum in 1930,
exclusively to his scholarship and translations.
During the decade he spent translating Genji,
Waley continued his Museum-related scholarly
work with Introduction to Chinese Painting (1923)
and a translation of Sei Shonagon’s The Pillow Book
(1928), which served to deepen postwar Britain’s
appetite for the exotic, feminized aesthetic world

of a medieval Japonaise whetted by the serial publication of The Tale of Genji in the British Vogue.
After completion of the sixth and final volume
of Genji in 1933, Waley returned to his first
textual love, classical Chinese, with a series of translations over the next three decades that, in effect,
defined the Chinese literary canon for Western
readers – a body of work that purposefully
included philosophical and religious texts in
addition to poetry, as well as scholarly work
reflecting an impulse to educate the general
public: The Way and Its Power: A Study of the
Tao Te Ching and Its Place in Chinese Thought
(1934), the Book of Songs: Shih Ching (1937),
The Analects (1938), Three Ways of Thought in

Waley was first and last a polymath with a
wide range of interests relating to Asia; interests
that late in his career resulted in predominantly
historical and anthropological studies that benefited from the same rigor and thoroughness that
characterized his translation work. He was, for
example, a prolific (and very early) contributor
to the Bloomsbury-centered New Statesman, to
which he contributed an eclectic range of essays
throughout his life. His overall achievement,
however, must inevitably be viewed within the context of his pioneering role in providing Western
readers, for the first time, with spare, accurate, yet
stylistically nuanced renderings of the central
representational works of the classical Chinese and
Japanese literary canons.
Much of the scholarship on Waley since his
death has focused on Britain’s post-Edwardian
enthusiasm for a romanticized East Asian aesthetic
promoted by Oscar Wilde and others, as well as
the sustained impact his work had on “imagist”
poetics of the early twentieth century popularized
through Pound’s appropriations of Chinese
poetic texts that bore little or no relation, in
either meaning or form, to the originals. In that
regard, Waley’s early translations were at the
center of a critical discourse that sought to elevate
translators and their works to a creative status
equal to the originals and their authors – a position that Waley dismissed out of hand. Throughout his life, Waley consistently emphasized the
simple notion that his task (one hears echoes

Warhol was the most iconic figure in Pop art.
Starting out as a successful commercial artist in
the 1950s, he entered the gallery world in 1962
with his pictures of Campbell’s soup tins. Warhol,
though, was less interested in using pop imagery
in his Art than in replicating its production
processes (his studio was named The Factory) and
its marketing devices (see Warhol and Hackett,
1980). Warhol’s influence on Popular culture
itself was thus immense; he gave artists an aesthetic justification for self-promotion, and pop
stars a way of interpreting the sales process as
art. David Bowie, among others, celebrated him
in song, but of all musicians Madonna probably
owes the most to Warhol’s example of how to
make commerce art.

`West, Cornel (1953–) 
Afro-American philosopher of religion and cultural critic. Following
studies at Harvard (AB, 1973) and Princeton
(PhD, 1980), West has been located at several
institutions of higher learning, most notably
Union Theological Seminary, Yale, the University
of Paris, and Princeton. In 1994 he joined the
faculties of the Department of Afro-American
Studies and the Divinity School at Harvard. His
position as an honorary chairperson of the Democratic Socialists of America is indicative of his
self-avowed role as an “organic intellectual.”
The uniqueness and power of his philosophical perspective derive from his effort to draw
together, in creative synthesis, several seemingly
disparate traditions of theory and practice:
prophetic Christianity, historicist pragmatism,
progressive Marxism, and African-American
critical thought. As West interprets these traditions, each in its own way provides support
for the two ethical principles that pervade all
his thought, the dignity of the individual and
radical democracy.
Prophetic Christianity is epitomized by West
in three themes: the imago Dei (a basis for revolutionary egalitarianism); fallenness (a ground
for radical democracy); and the kingdom of God
(a source of hope). From pragmatism, particularly

West, Cornel

primary texts with which he dealt. The fact that
his translations set a new, indeed revolutionary,
standard at the intersection of philology, style, and
evocativeness (strongly influencing the future
work of such figures as Burton Watson and
Donald Keene) was, for him, not of central
importance to his project. “Despite their imperfections my translations have in the past done
something towards inspiring a number of people
with the idea that, for lovers of poetry, Chinese
is a language worth learning.”
Finally, Waley’s personal life (he lived with
the dance critic Beryl de Zoete from 1918 until
her death in 1962, subsequently marrying longtime companion Alison Robinson just before his
own death in 1966) has also inspired a certain
amount of scholarly speculation vis-à-vis the
astounding fact, to many, of his complete lack of
interest in encountering any aspect of contemporary East Asia, as well as his close proximity to
the Bloomsbury Group, and speculation regarding how his own sexual orientation may or may not
have influenced his translations of, in particular,
Genji, who, as Waley wrote in an introduction to
a serialized installment in Vogue, “makes love to
a great many people, often several at once; but he
is always handicapped by just such sensibilities and
scruples as the civilised men and women whom
we know do actually feel.”

that of John Dewey, West appropriates a strong
anti-metaphysical bent, leading him to stress the
need for constant political struggle in a history
that is inevitably burdened with tragedy, but
within which the possibility for liberation is a
constant hope.
West distinguishes progressive Marxism
from Leninism and Stalinism in its democratic
sensibilities (Rosa Luxemburg) and its attention to culturally specific forms of Hegemony
and counterhegemony (Antonio Gramsci).
The heuristic virtue of Marxist social analysis,
in West’s judgment, is its focus on the dynamic
interconnections that conjoin dominant social
structures and oppositional forces.
Yet, while West draws deeply from these
religious and philosophical traditions, he affirms
that the primary root of his thought and practice is the African-American (or “New World
African”) community which, given its unique
history, is as much a source of prophetic criticism
of authoritarian domination, particularly in the
form of white supremacy, as Euro-American
Modernity. However, he carefully distinguishes
his perspective from both black conservativism
and black Liberalism, identifying himself as an
African-American socialist Christian. Moreover,
he rejects both the Romanticism of AfricanAmerican exceptionalists and the self-denigration
of Afro-American assimilationalists on behalf
of a kind of Humanism that acknowledges the
special historical character and struggles of
the African-American community. Given prevailing social and cultural circumstances, West has
recently expressed special concern for the nihilism
– the deep sense of meaninglessness – pervasive
throughout the lower classes of AfricanAmericans, and for the crisis of leadership – the
lack of moral vision – that extends throughout
the African-American political and intellectual
elite.
West associates his work with postmodernist
movements, particularly in their divergence from
Eurocentric modes of thought and practice and
their receptivity to radical forms of heterogeneity and difference. Even so, he distinguishes his
own perspective from those kinds of Postmodernism that result in sheer moral relativism
and political indifference. Hence he calls upon the
“new cultural politics of difference” to engage
in an extensive critique of capitalist civilization

and the collaborative empowerment of all those
classes of persons who have been subjugated and
oppressed by that dominant system. In his assessment, a genuinely prophetic politics would move
beyond both the hegemony of Eurocentrism and
the cacophony of Multiculturalism toward a
new form of thoroughgoing democracy.

American linguist and anthropologist. Trained as a
chemical engineer, Whorf spent his working life
in the insurance business. His lifelong interest
in language led him to study linguistics under
Edward Sapir, and his publications aroused
great interest. His main writings were reissued
posthumously in Language, Thought, and Reality
(1956).
Whorf is best known for his view that the language you speak influences the way you think.
This view is known as the Whorf hypothesis:
since Sapir on occasion expressed similar views,
it is sometimes called the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. Whorf ’s interest in this area arose out of
his insurance work, where part of his job was
to study fire prevention. He noticed that certain
rigid patterns of thought persistently led people
to ignore fire risks, and he tried to relate these rigid
thought patterns to linguistic Structures.
Whorf went on to study the language of the
Hopi Indians, and was struck by the world view
that seemed to him to be embodied in the
structure and vocabulary of the language, which
looked so different from the world view of
English and what he called “Standard Average
European” languages. He went on to publish
several papers claiming that the world view

`Williams, Bernard (1929–2003) 
British philosopher. A broad range of intellectual concerns
gave Williams’s analytically clear philosophical
work unusual reach and depth: he was adept at
discussing Greek tragedy as well as the philosophical implications of the modern natural
scientific outlook. Much of Williams’s recent
work grew out of his attacks on traditional
moral philosophy, in which he was critical of
both the utilitarian and Kantian traditions.
For example, in “Persons, character, and morality” (Williams, 1981, essay 1), Williams argued
that neither of these strands of ethical thought
can grasp the importance of “ground projects,”
those commitments that give us a reason to go
on living. If our ground projects were to conflict
with the demands of a Kantian or utilitarian
moral standard, we would be morally required to
give up those commitments – yet they are required
for us to care enough about going on to do
anything at all. In “Moral luck” and “Conflicts
of values” (Williams, 1981, essays 2 and 4) he
argued that it is to a significant extent a matter

Williams, Bernard

encoded in each language determines the way its
speakers perceive and interpret the world.
The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is best seen as
combining two separate claims: linguistic determinism and linguistic relativity (see Slobin, 1979,
pp. 174–85). Linguistic determinism holds that
language determines thought; linguistic relativity
says that the relationship between language and
thought varies in different languages. It is possible to support determinism without believing
in relativity: for example, Chomsky’s belief in
universal grammar could be described as determinism without relativity (see Chomsky, Noam).
Whorf seems to have supported both determinism and relativity, though there are passages
in his work which merely express the weaker
claim that language influences rather than determines thought. The strong Sapir–Whorf hypothesis does not seem tenable. If it were true,
translation between languages should be impossible much of the time: but translation is clearly
possible, though not necessarily easy, most of
the time. Later work also cast doubt on some of
Whorf’s claims about Hopi (see Malotki, 1983).
If the strong form of the hypothesis is not
tenable, the weak form is not very interesting.
It is easy to show connections between language
and thought: but extrapolating from these to
the claim that the influence is one-way is rather
pointless. Later research in psycholinguistics
tended to concentrate on universals of language
and thought, rather than stressing variation as
Whorf did.
One reason why the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis
has remained alive is that a discussion of it makes
a convenient essay task for first-year undergraduates in linguistics. The lessons that students
should be encouraged to draw, however, are not
about language and thought but about scientific
hypotheses. A hypothesis should first be precise
enough to be testable. Second, when tested, it
should look as if it might be correct. If it turns
out to be incorrect, we may still have learned
interesting things from disproving it. Whorf’s
hypothesis seems to fail on all three grounds.

1982.)

of luck whether what one does is rationally
justified, and that there is not only a plurality
of “the most basic values” but in fact a real
incommensurability between them.
Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (Williams,
1985) brought together various strands of these
and other criticisms of traditional ethical theories,
and explored the territory beyond moral theory
itself. Ethical thought needs to be liberated from
“morality,” that subspecies of ethics best expressed
in the Kantian attempt to uncover a realm of
obligation beyond the reach of luck, and from
“theory,” which is not the only kind of reflection,
not the only way to combat prejudice, and which
trades in “thin” rather than “thick” ethical
notions – the latter being notions like “brutality”
and “courage,” which (unlike the more general
notion of “moral obligation”) “seem to express
a union of fact and value” and typically offer
reasons for action (Williams, 1985, pp. 129ff ).
Philosophical theory often undoes our confidence in such thick notions, but this says more
about the limits of philosophy than about their
importance. Our best hope in ethics is to seek thick
ethical concepts that survive reflection and social
practices that use these concepts.
The ground for much of Williams’s work,
both critical and constructive, was what might be
called his non-moralistic moral psychology, and
his method of inquiry therefore gave a primacy
to “life as it is actually experienced” rather than
to philosophical or pre-philosophical “intuitions”
(Williams, 1981, p. 37; 1985, chapter 6). The
published version of his Sather lectures, Shame
and Necessity (Williams, 1993), both applied
and extended his earlier psychological inquiries.
There Williams saw the Greeks as neither “primitives” whom we have transcended nor members
of a past golden age; though our distance from
them is not to be forgotten, many aspects of
their thought are closer to us than we might
have imagined. Thus the Homeric epics and
Greek tragedy, for example, offer a psychology
usefully freed from moral constraints – unlike the
psychology of Plato and Aristotle (let alone Kant
or the utilitarians). They also offer an understanding of human action free from the idea
that our ethical interests in those actions accord
in some way or other with the way the world is:
“We know that the world was not made for us,
or we for the world” (Williams, 1993, p. 166).

As he himself noted in Shame and Necessity
(Williams, 1993, p. 9), in some important ways
Williams’s work was reminiscent of Nietzsche:
at the heart of his psychology there was a questioning of the project of self-unification and of
the power the moral and the ideal seems to have
over us. Williams nonetheless explicitly distanced
himself from Nietzsche’s comments about politics in that work (Williams, 1993, pp. 10ff). Yet
there seemed to be another, perhaps even more
important, difference: Nietzsche claimed that
modern natural science had not yet “de-deified”
nature enough, and so would have been skeptical
of Williams’s claim that modern natural science
can offer us an “absolute conception of the
world” (Williams, 1985, chapter 8). Nietzsche
was thereby led to a perspectivism more radical
than that of Williams, whose apparently unshakable commitment to some form of scientific
realism also seemed to distinguish him from
contemporary thinkers following the path of
Richard Rorty. For Williams, modern natural
science was decidedly not “just one more story”
about the way the world is. In the final book
he published, Truth and Truthfulness: An Essay in
Genealogy (Williams, 2002), Williams confronted
these sorts of issues directly, responding both to
“deniers” like Rorty, whose style of thought in
Williams’s view “denies the possibility of truth
altogether, waves its importance aside, or claims
that all truth is ‘relative’ or suffers from some
other such disadvantage,” and to “the party of
common sense” who waves the deniers’ views
themselves aside, “having rehabilitated truth in
some of its everyday roles” (Williams, 2002,
pp. 4ff). Williams argues instead for the importance of truth and truthfulness, and two virtues of
truth, Accuracy and Sincerity: “you do the best
you can to acquire true beliefs, and what you say
reveals what you believe” (Williams, 2002, p. 11).
In doing so, he not only adapts Nietzschean
genealogy but argues that Nietzsche’s views on
truth were closer to his own than one might
otherwise imagine.
Three volumes of Williams’s essays, some of
which reach all the way back to the beginning of
his career, were published posthumously: In the
Beginning Was the Deed: Realism and Moralism in
Political Argument (Williams, 2005), Philosophy
as a Humanistic Discipline (Williams, 2006a),

`Williams, Raymond (1921–88) 
British cultural critic. One of the most significant socialist
intellectuals in postwar British history, Raymond
Williams’s work had a major influence on
Cultural theory and history from the late
1950s. He was born in the Welsh border village
of Pandy, the son of a railway signalman, and
after a local schooling went to Trinity College,
Cambridge, in 1939, from which he was called up
from 1941 to 1945. After leaving Cambridge he
worked in adult education from 1946 until 1961,
when he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of
Jesus College, where he stayed for the rest of his
working life. He always saw himself as an active

socialist, and as a “Welsh European’’ occupying
the “border country” between different cultural
and social worlds. His writing ranges across
cultural and literary history, studies of drama
and society, theories of cultural formations and
institutions, and the changing social significance
of language and the media. He also wrote fiction
alongside and in dialog with his theoretical work.
Williams’s work both grows out of and against
the dominant cultural traditions that he analyzed. Culture and Society (1958) emphasized the
notion of Culture as process – not simply the
highest products of a society, the great works of
an individual genius – and traced a history of the
cultural critique of industrial capitalism (which,
he argued, was profoundly politically contradictory) from Burke and Cobbett, through Ruskin,
Arnold, Morris, Eliot, and Leavis. Its sequel,
The Long Revolution (1961), emphasized and
developed the broader definition of culture as
a way of life. It analyzed the evolving history of
cultural forms and institutions in Britain over the
previous 200 years and developed a theoretical
framework within which to explore this process
of dynamic change. Here Williams develops
his concepts of Structures of feeling and
Dominant, residual, and emergent cultures
to help understand the complex ideological
negotiations which might exist at any particular
moment and the uneven ways these structures
of feeling shift historically, and both dominant
and oppositional forms emerge.
These concepts, elaborated and developed
throughout his work, became central to what
Williams was to later term Cultural materialism. He argued that cultural forms are not
simply the effect of a primary economic process
but also actively constitute that process, and that
cultural struggle and the acknowledgement of
the diversity of cultural identity are central to any
genuinely democratic society. Thus studies of the
politics of language are crucial to this analysis:
The Long Revolution traces the development of
standard English as a key process in the establishment of the Hegemony of a dominant metropolitan culture; Keywords (1976) teases out these
questions in a more intricate way by looking at
the complex history of specific notions and concepts. Also crucial is his analysis of the broadcast
media; he refuted both technological determinism, whereby mass communications become

a monolithic agent of control, and the elitist
perception of users of the media as “telly-glued
masses,” manipulated by the state and consumer
capitalism.
Raymond Williams’s work flourished on
Tension, Complexity, and Contradiction
– between “High” and “Popular” culture,
between tradition and Modernity, between
a sense of cultural roots and the experience of
their dislocation, between public and private,
region and metropolis. As in his analysis of the
changing meanings of rural and urban life,
The Country and the City (1973), he wanted to
analyze the structural formation of economic
and cultural divisions and identities, without
losing sight of the lived experience in which
these identities are embodied, or the “resources
of a journey of hope” which can look optimistically toward the future, as he does in Towards
2,000. “Community” is a key word throughout his
writing, but it is a shifting term: it is made up
of the combination of relations, place, mutual
recognition, shared experience, and class identity.

`Winnicott, Donald Woods (1896–1971)
British pediatrician, child psychiatrist, and psychoanalyst associated with the Object-relations
school and influenced by Klein.
Winnicott often remarked that there is no such
thing as a baby, meaning that a baby cannot exist
outside a relationship with a carer. The successful development of the child depends upon the
provision of a facilitating environment by a
“good enough” mother – the choice of terminology
reflects an attempt to avoid an idealization of
the maternal function. Good enough mothering
permits a gradual development toward independence; its absence may result in the creation of
a false self which colludes with environmental
demands and hides the true self.
Winnicott is noted for the introduction into
psychoanalytic thought of the notion of the

transitional object. Typically, this is a material
object such as a blanket to which the child
develops a powerful emotional attachment. It
allows the child to begin the transition from the
initial oral relationship with the mother to true
object-relations. As it is the child’s first “not-me
possession,” the transformational object permits
an initial spatial differentiation between me and
not-me.

david macey
`Wittgenstein, Ludwig (1889–1951) 
Philosopher, born in Vienna, studied at Cambridge
University with Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore.
He received his PhD in 1929 and was appointed
a Fellow of Trinity College in 1930. While never
losing touch with academic life, he was never
comfortable with it and constantly sought refuge,
spending many years away from Cambridge.
Much of his philosophical work was done outside academic environments, and he often felt
the need to stop or completely give up his work
in favor of other things. He spent six years
(1920–26) teaching classes of Austrian school
children (mainly ages 9 and 10), an experience that
resulted in the publication, in 1926, of a small
dictionary Wörterbuch für Volksschulen, which
he developed for use by his pupils. Shortly thereafter he spent two years helping plan and build
a house for his sister. While such sojourns and
desires to leave academic philosophy continued
throughout his life, he was constantly pulled
back to Cambridge to lecture, and his influence
and reputation grew greatly through these lectures.
He was, however, dissatisfied with his efforts
and often remarked that he was doing nothing but
harm and that he was teaching others nothing
but a new jargon. Only two of his works (other
than the dictionary) were published during his
life-time, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922)
(titled by Moore) and “Some remarks on logical
form” (1929). His central work Philosophical
Investigations (which he began writing while living
in a small hut in Norway in 1936) was published

727
Philosophical Investigations attempts to reveal
the indispensable nature of the “ordinary” for
philosophical inquiry. Wittgenstein says in the
Investigations that philosophy’s task (his task) “is
to bring words back from their metaphysical to
their everyday use.” He is therefore often labeled
an ordinary language philosopher and that is
not without justification. However, such a label
seems often given to oppose him to metaphysical
or abstract inquiry. That reading is deceptive as
neither conception of Wittgenstein is accurate
without the other, for he may just as usefully be
labeled a philosopher of metaphysical language
as one of ordinary language . . . What “has to
be accepted,” the (metaphysical) given, for
Wittgenstein, is found in the (ordinary) things
we do and say, in our forms of life and language
games. We must not in our philosophical
inquiries forget the training and ordinary ways of
speaking we have been given by our elders. The
temptation, however, is to leave behind or clean
up that life and language given to us by others
in order to expose supposed hidden truths or
metaphysical realities. This, says Wittgenstein,
is a natural temptation, a temptation resulting
from our ways of using ordinary language. Much
of the value and confusion of ordinary language
is found in understanding the Tensions between
such language and the desire to leave or correct
it. It is in the systematic orderings of ordinary
language that we discover the kind of object
anything is. Grammar expresses essence for
Wittgenstein and metaphysical investigations are
inseparable from investigations of the ordinary.
Proper philosophical inquiry, says Wittgenstein,
is a descriptive enterprise, stating what we already
know but are in need of reminding – reminders
which emphasize what it is that makes possible
what we are doing and saying. Philosophy is
not to seek explanations or advance any kind of
theory, but rather present the possibilities and the
conditions of talk and action, with the hope of
untying the intellectual knots that have resulted
from lack of attention to language use. Humans
are naturally and easily misled by the expressions
they use. This results mainly from restricted and
partial considerations about what we say, the
fixing of our attention on a single or simple
conception or theory (a “one-sided diet”), and
not asking what makes possible that perspective.

posthumously in 1953. Several other influential
works also published posthumously include Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics (1956),
Zettel (1967), On Certainty (1969), all named
and organized by editors.
It is sometimes convenient to distinguish
between an early and a late Wittgenstein, where
the first refers to his work in logic and the
Tractatus, and the second looks at the Investigations and his concerns with language. While convenient, such a perspective can be misleading.
Wittgenstein does speak of “grave mistakes” in his
first work, but he does not repudiate that work
or cease to be interested in its topics. Rather
he situates these “earlier” concerns within his
broadened and continuing thoughts about language. (He had hoped, in fact, to have both
works published together within the same cover.)
These two Texts each exhibit a transcendental
(Kantian) spirit in their approach and the questions they ask. In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein
attempts to show that the conditions that make
possible our saying things meaningfully lie in the
formal structures of logic, in the logic of language.
In the Investigations, he wonders about the conditions that make possible those things we are
interested in, and attempts to show the contexts
and conditions that make possible logical inquiry
and anything else humans do. Each work has
a concern with the nature of philosophy, the
limits and character of language, and the possibilities and conditions of the human.
In his texts, Wittgenstein attempts to give
his ideas a proper literary form, and the way
in which things are written is of importance to
him. Numbered remarks populate his writings
and the system of their arrangement is closely
tied to what they express. The Tractatus indicates
this concern through the topics of saying and
showing, whereas the Investigations approaches
it through an emphasis on language games
and forms of life. Both texts have been cited as
intriguing examples of the marriage of form
and content. The Investigations, in particular,
has been seen as a masterful “feat of Writing,”
with its careful attention to grammar, its use
of dashes, parentheses, and expression of many
voices; all to produce a text of multiple perspectives and possibilities of interpretation which show
different pictures of the landscape of language that
Wittgenstein finds himself investigating.

Wittig, Monique

in the Tractatus, is that what a proposition is is
illustrated by a few commonplace examples, and
then presupposed as understood in full generality” (1989, p. 10).) When we concentrate on
questions about the possibilities of language and
being for long enough, we find ourselves confronted with what we do and what we say, for
example, stating a fact, constructing a building,
painting a picture, counting with five apples,
teaching how to count with five apples, pointing to five apples. Each of these is an example
of ordinary things we do and sets the context
and conditions that make possible what we can
meaningfully say. They are examples of what
Wittgenstein calls forms of life; our physical
ways of being, over which we have no choice –
the ways we naturally are – but that we distinguish
and identify (name) by our words, our ability
to speak, by particular language-games.
Wittgenstein’s emphasis on and attention to
the ordinary and his resistance to explanation and
theory as part of proper philosophical inquiry
naturally produce criticism from many, especially those scientifically inclined in their thinking.
If it is finally “grammar” that expresses essence
and it is the systematic ordering of our ordinary
language that philosophy must remind us of,
then must there not be something on which
grammar depends, something objective which
science can discover? What value does science have
for the philosopher? Is there not value in scientific
theory and explanation? Wittgenstein responds
that science helps the philosopher by making the
imagining of human possibilities easier by discovery of facts. As to the spirit of those questions
that suggests philosophy ought to become science
or be founded on it, or give way to discovery
of objective facts, he reminds us that the very
questions being asked here are framed, and must
be so, in language; they have to be expressed
in ordinary language, if there is anything to be
asked. To say, as he tried in the Tractatus, “This
is how things are” is to still be unclear about what
the conditions are that make such an assertion
possible. And the initial approach to understanding those conditions is to remember that the
claim itself is a proposition, an English sentence,
and that we need to ask how the sentence is to
be applied, how it is used in our everyday language.
For that is where we got it from and nowhere else,
and we were trained to use it in certain ways. None

of this simple give and take, question and
response, will satisfy the scientifically inclined
or correctly capture Wittgenstein’s writing or
its unsettling character. None the less, it might be
useful to say that possibly the greatest philosophical wonder confronted and engendered by
Wittgenstein is the simple fact that there are
creatures who use language. In many important
ways this is the fact at which he wants us to
be most amazed and the one he himself found
most amazing and wondrous. In that spirit he
is first and foremost a philosopher of (human)
language.

`Wittig, Monique (1935–2003) 
French feminist and writer. Wittig’s work attempts to overturn the present System in order to create new
sets of relations, expressed in “new language” –
one derived from the feminine. This language,
Wittig believes, will be found in the gaps and
silences of male language and “ ‘his’tory,” in the
zero, the O, the perfect circle that you invent”
(1969, p. 164). Wittig offers perhaps the clearest
example of écriture féminine. Her Writing practice attempts to make the categories of sex and
Gender obselete, in particular by the destabilization of “I” signalled by the splitting of the
subject: I/I, symbolizing a new language where
the “I” relinquishes its position of power, and
refuses the appropriation of the other.

reputation of Mary Wollstonecraft has been

century movement wished to reclaim her as
one of the first feminists, there was an effort to
separate her writing from her licentious reputation, and works of the time denied many of the
embarrassing details of her personal life. Even
in the twentieth century her feminist views
were denigrated from disgust at her life: in 1947,
in Modern Woman, the Lost Sex, Ferdinand
Lundberg and Marynia Farnham found both
her life and her views the result of a severe case
of penis envy. Since the 1960s, however, in
conjunction with the new feminist movement,
Wollstonecraft has become an attractive figure
precisely because of the boldness and nonconformity of her personal stand, although some
biographers have clearly felt too great a discrepancy between the unhappy emotional life and
the rational work. Some feminist commentators,
reading against the grain, have found the rational
language of A Vindication too much a collusion
with male Discourse. The edition of her complete works in 1989, including the first publication of her translations and reviews for the
Analytical Review, allows judgment of her output as a whole and helps her to be seen as one of
the earliest feminist critics as well as one of the
pivotal figures in the development of modern
political feminism.

`womanism 
An alternative term for black
feminism, coined and defined by Alice Walker
in In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens (1984). In
an attempt to articulate a feminist consciousness
both indigenous to black Culture and distinct
from white American and European versions of
feminism, Walker derived the term “womanist”
from the black vernacular word “womanish.” As
opposed to “girlish,” the expression “womanish”
evokes the qualities of independence, audacity,

womanism

modern feminist movement. Since the 1960s she
has been the subject of six full-length biographies
and a bibliography, while editions of her major
works have proliferated. There is interest in both
her life and her writings. These included novels,
histories, reviews, children’s books, pedagogical
and political treatises, and a travel book, as well
as A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792),
for which she is most famous. In this book she
made daring claims for the extension of the
Enlightenment rights of men to women, by
arguing against the sentimental emphasis on the
difference between men and women and asserting instead an intellectual and spiritual equality
which women should be allowed to prove through
proper education. The trivial and sexualized
character she admitted that she saw in women,
and which Rousseau and other male theoreticians described as natural was, she insisted, the
result of cultural construction. The Vindication
was quite well received by the public of 1792,
but in the following years attitudes toward it
and its author changed radically, owing to the
strengthening of conservative opinion and the
extraordinary exposure of Wollstonecraft’s life
by her husband, William Godwin, in his loving
but imprudent Memoirs of the Author of A
Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798). From
that time onward her life – her fraught loves of
another struggling girl, Fanny Blood, who died
after childbirth; of the married painter, Henry
Fuseli; of the American entrepreneur, Gilbert
Imlay, which led to the birth of her first daughter and to her two suicide attempts; and finally
of the philosopher, Godwin, whom she married
just before the birth of her second daughter
Mary – was coupled firmly with the message of
her works. The result was that feminism and
sexual license became fused in the public mind.
Wollstonecraft was immediately attacked as an
unsexed female and a whore. Her book was
revealed in numerous novels as the sexual corrupter of young girls. George Eliot, writing in 1855,
was surprised to find the Vindication a rational
and moral book at odds with the improper
reputation of its author.
Although she was a felt presence in the lives
of many feminist thinkers, Victorian feminism,
aiming at political and social influence for women,
was on the whole frightened by Wollstonecraft’s
sexualized image. When the late nineteenth-

responsibility, and tough capability that, according to Walker and other black feminists, have
enabled black women to resist their history of
racial and sexual oppression in the United States.
Walker uses the term “womanism” not only
to clarify black women’s exclusion from and
rejection of the white middle-class definition of
Femininity, but also to project a feminist program that might integrate the aims of sexual and
racial emancipation. A nonseparatist Ideology
that refuses to privilege sexual over racial or
Class oppression, womanism is committed to
promoting the unity and liberation of the entire
black community.

`women’s studies 
The term “women’s studies” is used in two major ways: as a synonym for
Feminist criticism and scholarship generally,
and as the name for that ensemble of university
departments, research centers, professional organizations, journals, presses, conferences, and other
academic “houses” specifically dedicated to promoting such scholarship. Women’s studies has
frequently been called the “academic arm of the
feminist movement.” Whether located inside
or outside traditional educational institutions,
women’s studies is envisaged as a “safe space” for
feminist intellectuals, designed to facilitate the
personal and intellectual growth of its participants and challenge the sexism of society at
large. Catherine Stimpson (1986) summarizes
three specific major goals of women’s studies:
“teaching the subject of women properly; ending
sex discrimination in education at all levels,
from pre-kindergarten to postdoctoral study;
and integrating feminist activism with feminist
thought” (pp. 12–13). Additionally, the goal of
proper teaching raises a complex set of other,
related issues: content (what is taught), pedagogy
(how it is taught), subjects (the questions asked
in classroom and laboratory), and theory and
method (how questions are answered and research
conducted; what counts as knowledge).

Although the first classes in women’s studies
were taught in the 1960s in Britain and the
United States, the history of women’s studies
extends much further back, beginning perhaps
with Christine de Pisan (c.1364–1431), a French
noblewoman who argued that women have the
same capacity for learning and right to be educated as men, and including such advocates of
women’s education as Mary Wollstonecraft in
the eighteenth century and Margaret Fuller in
the nineteenth. However, while the argument for
women’s education that was finally successful at
the end of the nineteenth century was concerned
with making women better companions for
men and better suited to fulfill their designated
roles in Patriarchy, the architects of women’s
studies argued that feminist scholarship and teaching must be not only about women, but also for
women – specifically, for women’s liberation
from male dominance.
A number of historical developments converged
in the 1960s to make women’s studies, with its
avowedly radical mission, possible: demographic
changes affecting higher education generally, the
free university movement, and widespread political dissent (including anti-colonial movements
internationally and the black civil rights and
women’s liberation movements in the United
States, where women’s studies is most extensively developed). In the 1960s higher education
was undergoing democratization, an opening of
its doors to classes of people formerly excluded
de jure or de facto. After three decades of setbacks
for women in their struggle for higher education,
their rate of enrollment and appointment to
teaching positions in Western universities was
again on the rise, as was that of black and workingclass people as well. The intellectual climate
was extremely receptive to change, as scholars
in every discipline explored new theories and
methods. The developments of Deconstruction
in literary studies and revisionist social history,
or the study of history from the point of view of
ordinary people, are perhaps the most powerful
examples of the kinds of sweeping intellectual
innovation that characterized the academy in the
1960s. However, even scholars in the sciences
revealed signs of skepticism toward received
tradition, as in Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions (1962), which demonstrated
the contingent and provisional status of scientific

731
Collective of Our Bodies, Ourselves (1976; 1984),
a book that has educated at least two generations of women about sexuality, reproduction,
and health.
Within established academic structures, the
growth of women’s studies has been phenomenal.
Stimpson (1986) reports that in 1969–70 a mere
17 courses about women were offered in the
United States, but by 1973 there were more than
2,000 courses and 80 women’s studies programs;
by 1980 the number of women’s studies courses
had swelled to over 20,000 and the number of
programs to 350; by 1982 universities offered a
staggering 30,000 courses in women’s studies.
The National Women’s Studies Association Task
Force for the Association of American Colleges
counted 621 women’s studies programs in 1991,
with 68 percent of all universities offering them.
Extensive networks have rapidly developed for the
exchange of information and ideas. Numerous collections of course outlines have been published,
beginning with Female Studies, a ten-volume
series sponsored in the 1970s first by the MLA
Commission on the Status of Women and then
by the Clearinghouse on Women’s Studies of
the Feminist Press. Early on, the sheer bulk
of new courses forced an abandonment of the
comprehensiveness and interdisciplinary scope
attempted in Female Studies; in the 1980s booklength collections of syllabi and course designs
would continue to appear, but be more narrowly
focused, as in Paul Lauter’s Reconstructing
American Literature (1983). In the 1990s feminist
teachers have shared syllabi electronically, via
the “Women’s Studies List” (WMST-L), an Internet discussion group. Between the mid-1970s
and mid-1990 archives and research centers
have been established at a dizzying rate. Some
are independently funded, like the communitybased Lesbian Herstory Archives in New York
or the Institute for Research in History and the
Center for Women’s Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. Others, like The Bunting Institute at
Radcliffe, or centers at Wellesley and Memphis
State, rely on a combination of university subsidy, federal grants, and foundation money.
International centers exist too, including the
International Research and Training Institute
for the Advancement of Women, funded by
the United Nations, the Association of African
Women for Research and Development, and the

women’s studies

knowledge. By the 1980s this Paradigm shift
pervading academia would be recognized as a
“crisis of knowledge,” suggesting a mandate to
reform old disciplines, wedge open spaces for new
ones, or even surpass disciplinarity altogether.
The advent of Postmodernism inevitably supported the formation of women’s studies, but
equally influential were the more immediately
political calls for “relevance” in education, by
which was meant that institutions of higher
learning should cease to be the handmaidens of
the repressive state and instead serve grass-roots
struggles for freedom and democracy.
Many of the new female academics also participated in New Left politics; their participation
in the Civil Rights movement must especially
not be underestimated. As in the nineteenth
century, when abolitionism became the hotbed of
feminism, the young discipline of black studies and
the freedom schools run by such organizations
as the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the nationalist Black Panthers
were the original models for women’s studies. The
first women’s studies courses were not taught
in universities, but at Susan Koppelman’s School
for Women in Boston and the New Orleans Free
School, affiliated with Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), in 1966, and the British AntiUniversity in 1968. Many free school ventures have
been launched since then, but most such projects have been short-lived, both because funds
have been chronically lacking and because most
women pursue educational programs in order
to obtain professional or vocational certification
(see Bunch and Pollack, 1983). Throughout the
1970s, countless women joined informal study
and consciousness-raising groups in which nonhierarchical, cooperative methods of learning
were developed, techniques that have had a
considerable impact on feminist pedagogy in
academia. Since the 1970s the independent, free
school model of women’s studies is still usefully employed, often in connection with artists’
colonies and organizations providing direct
services to women, as when shelters for battered
women conduct reading groups for clients and
volunteers. Although the primary location of
women’s studies did not ultimately become the
free university, women’s studies outside academia
can claim some noteworthy achievements, such
as the publication by the Boston Women’s Health

women’s studies

732
Asian and Pacific Centre for Women and Development (for an extensive directory, see Albrecht
and Brewer, 1990). Feminist caucuses and professional organizations have been formed within
scholarly societies at every level, from the regional
to the international, and new organizations
founded, such as the National Women’s Studies
Association in 1977, which sponsors one of many
annual conferences in women’s studies. Fellowships, prizes, and chairs have been endowed; and
journals and presses proliferated. The Feminist
Press, begun by Florence Howe and Paul Lauter
in 1970, was one of the first feminist presses and
remains one of the most important, although
there are now numerous others, including the
Kitchen Table: Women of Color, Crossing, and
Pergamon presses. Indeed, virtually every major
publisher, including all the university presses,
now has an established women’s studies series
or division, and a staggering number of women’s
studies journals are also now in print, including
prominently Signs, Feminist Studies, Women’s
Studies, Sage, Gender and Society, and Women’s
Studies International Forum. Clearly, the rapid
pace with which women’s studies has become
legitimized indicates that urgent needs were
being met.
The first and most urgent of those needs was
to sate an enormous hunger for information
about women and analysis of women’s lives, to
develop ways of knowing that did not, to paraphrase historian Gerda Lerner, leave out half of
humanity. Women’s studies has been incredibly
productive, generating an enormous body of
scholarship with paradigmatic implications for
every discipline. Scholarship and curriculum
revision have proceeded hand in hand, as
women’s studies practitioners first seemed to ask
what Mary Daly called “non-questions about
non-data,” and then moved to make women
visible and reinterpret women’s roles in history
and contributions to culture. Just as early work
in black studies was envisaged as a necessary
corrective to the demeaning representation of
black people in the dominant racist culture –
a means of demonstrating the street slogan,
“Black is Beautiful” – early work in women’s
studies began with critique of the stereotyped
and derogatory representation of women in
male dominant culture, with analysis of the ideological charge of “images of women,” especially

their destructive psychological impact as oppression is internalized. An early anthology of
feminist Literary criticism, Susan Koppelman
[Cornillon]’s Images of Women in Literature
(1972), reveals this moment well, even as it
gestures toward the next phase of women’s
studies work: the title of one contributor’s essay
is “Why aren’t we writing about ourselves?” By
the mid-1980s this process of curriculum revision
would be theorized as a progression through
distinct stages, beginning with the exclusion of
women from the disciplines and ending with the
complete transformation of disciplinary materials,
theories, and methods. In 1985 literary scholars
Gilbert and Gubar articulated a four-stage
process: critique, recovery, reconceptualization, and
reassessment (see also Tetreault, 1985). Critique
consists of analyzing the absence of women as
both Subjects and objects of inquiry, as well
as understanding androcentric epistemologies
that pose exclusively male subjects and points
of view as universal and distribute sexist biases
throughout the disciplinary field. Recovery consists of refocusing women’s historical experience
and their agency as producers of culture; it is
frankly compensatory and separatist, for it seeks
to understand women’s experience and cultural
production on their own terms. Gerda Lerner’s
Black Women in White America (1972), Nancy
Cott’s Root of Bitterness (1972), and Nochlin
and Harris’s Women Artists, 1550–1950 (1979) all
exemplify recovery, since they document the
presence of women in history and begin to
form alternative Canons. Because androcentric
epistemologies are premised on the exclusion
of women, recovery not only produces new
information, but also forces the development of
alternative perspectives and reconceptualization
of paradigms, theories, and methods. New categories of analysis are furnished and old theories
are revised. Much feminist work on women’s
psychology is in this vein, for example, the
revision of Freudian theory in the 1970s by
such scholars as Juliet Mitchell and Nancy
Chodorow or the revision of Kohlberg’s androcentric model of ethical development by Carol
Gilligan in 1982. Reassessment entails the nonsexist
reintegration of men and women, as both subjects
and objects of inquiry. Reassessment tends to
focus on gender relations and uses both revised
androcentric theories and new gynocentric ones

733
Walter’s Transforming the Curriculum: Ethnic
Studies and Women’s Studies (1991), measure
three decades in the development of a practice
of women’s studies committed both to multicultural diversity and anti-racism.
Because women’s studies has been so incredibly
productive, it is beyond the scope of this discussion to summarize adequately its achievements
within each of the disciplines, but such overviews
are provided in The Impact of Feminist Research
in the Academy (Farnham, 1987) for anthropology, history, religious studies, psychology, science,
economics, political science, literature, and
sociology in the mid-1980s. Generally, one can say
that women’s studies has firmly distinguished
between sex and gender and established gender
as a legitimate category of analysis. Women’s
studies has documented the oppression of women
in every sphere of social life; raised public awareness about a number of issues including violence
against women and the feminization of poverty;
helped create awareness of and respect for
women’s multiple roles in the economy and of a
“gender gap” in politics; and promoted knowledge
of women’s agency in history and achievements
in the arts. Women’s studies has pioneered new
pedagogical techniques and research methodologies that integrate theory and praxis (see Bowles
and Klein, 1983; Cullley and Portuges, 1985; and
Weiler, 1988). Finally, women’s studies has had
a tremendous impact on public policy, as in the
virtual redefinition of rape in the courts since the
1960s. Ironically, though, women’s studies has had
little impact on the academy in which most of its
work is performed.
Because the dominant mode of reading in
the academy is eclectic and relativistic, women’s
studies has been easily absorbed and possibly
neutralized: it has become simply one mode
among many for describing and interpreting
the social world. Although women’s studies is
unevenly developed in the various disciplines,
making only crude generalizations possible, it
is safe to say that not a single discipline has
interpreted the findings of feminist scholarship
as a mandate for thorough reform. Although
scholarly publications in journals about women
have burgeoned, for example, they remain proportionally the same as they were in 1966, and
other indicators too, such as the content and
organization of introductory textbooks in most

women’s studies

to develop explanations that are truly universal.
In the 1990s reassessment is still mainly imagined,
a goal toward which women’s studies strives,
even as it is transformed from within by women
of color.
Just as white feminist scholarship antagonized
and criticized androcentric work, it has itself
been challenged for uncritically accepting and
reproducing racist premises and paradigms. The
title of an important landmark in black women’s
studies speaks volumes: All the Women are White,
All the Blacks are Men, But Some of Us are Brave:
Black Women’s Studies (Hull, Scott, and Smith
1982). This multidisciplinary collection of essays
on the theory, methods, and materials of black
women’s studies condemns the racism of a
feminist practice that excludes and marginalizes
black women, scrutinizes the problematic political
position of black women scholars in the postmodern academy, speculates about the radical
possibilities of black feminist teaching, and
distributes a large body of material to support such
teaching. It also reprints the crucially influential manifesto, “A black feminist statement,”
in which the Combahee River Collective rejects
one-dimensional theories of sexism, racism, and
class oppression, arguing instead that a radically
oppositional black feminist practice can only be
developed in tandem with theories that begin
by assuming a complex intersection of race,
class, and gender oppressions in black women’s
lives. Such Race–class–gender analysis has
had a powerful influence on white women’s
studies and androcentric black studies and ethnic
studies, and has even inspired a considerable
reexamination of white males – whose history
and cultural production continue to be most frequently and thoroughly studied in the academy
as a whole. A similar process of critique, recovery,
reconceptualization, and reassessment and a
similar commitment to race–class–gender analysis have also characterized the development of
Chicana, Asian-American, and Native American
women’s studies. The Memphis State University
Center for Research on Women has sponsored a
great deal of this work; their extensive databases
and series of working papers are incisive tools.
In addition, the ground-breaking anthologies,
Morgana and Anzaldua’s This Bridge Called My
Back (1981), Anzaldua’s Making Face, Making
Soul, Haciendo Caras (1990), and Butler and

women’s studies

734
disciplines, reveal that “by and large malebiased disciplinary frameworks remain firmly
entrenched” (Du Bois et al., 1985, p. 181). The
collective dream, articulated by Adrienne Rich
(1973), that academic feminists could radically
transform academia into a place where women’s
work and lives are treated with the same seriousness as are those of men has not yet been
realized, while the history of backlash against
women’s studies suggests that steady progress
toward this goal, however slow, cannot be assured.
In the 1970s opposition to women’s studies took
the form of firings, negative tenure decisions,
and cuts in funding to programs at individual
schools. In the 1980s, which saw a resurgence
of political conservativism, funds were cut at
the national level and a media campaign was
launched against women’s studies by the religious
right, characterizing it as a “takeover” of college
campuses by “feminazis,” man-hating lesbian
guerrillas disguised by a thin veneer of “ersatz
scholarship.”
However, dealing with backlash is only one
of the problems facing women’s studies in the
1990s. More serious is a cluster of issues which
indicate the need for greater inclusivity and
diversity in women’s studies. Since its beginnings,
women’s studies has been a site of political and
ideological diversity, yet despite the creative
possibilities diversity allows, it is often feared
and suppressed as a source of conflict. In the 1970s,
for example, there was considerable conflict
between Liberal and radical feminists about
whether or not women’s studies should represent
itself as overtly feminist, or even “political.”
That is, while most practitioners agreed that the
generation of knowledge is always somehow
charged with political significance, there was
disagreement about whether women’s studies
practitioners must also engage in activism outside
academia. Is it sufficient, for example, merely
to study wife-battering, or must one’s research
also have an immediate, direct, and quantifiable
impact on battered women’s lives? This conflict
was played out as a battle over how women’s
studies should be named (“Sex Role Studies,”
“Female Studies,” “Feminist Studies,” and of
course, “Women’s Studies” were all possibilities).
In the 1980s the question of naming was reopened
as the role of men in feminism was debated.
Some programs welcomed men and men’s

studies, renaming this cooperative effort “Gender
Studies.” Other programs resisted this movement,
claiming that work on men and Masculinity
should not compete for the increasingly limited
resources available to women’s studies. There
is no disagreement, however, about the need to
recruit and retain faculty members of color, which
is universally considered a major desideratum,
along with enhanced cooperation with ethnic
studies programs, as women’s studies continues
to be embarrassed and frustrated by its dominance
by white women. Similarly, international ties
need to be established or, where they exist,
strengthened, especially in the United States,
where intellectual and cultural provincialisms are
deeply ingrained habits. The curriculum should
be revised to reflect these commitments.
Other problems result from the lack of a
unifying Ideology for women’s studies, which
has been a central and unresolved problem since
its inception. Two related questions are important here: whether or not women’s studies is a
discipline, and whether or not “mainstreaming” should be women’s studies’ overriding goal
(Bowles and Klein, 1983). For either project to
succeed, women’s studies needs to establish itself
as authoritative, yet it is fundamentally a movement committed to anti-authoritarianism. The
conflict between the democratizing tendency
of women’s studies and its reproduction of the
authoritarian structures of patriarchy is nowhere
seen more clearly than in struggles over governance, which have been particularly thorny and
divisive, sometimes even destroying whole programs. Should women’s studies be governed by
faculty and administrators only, or should students
and women in the community also be empowered to shape programs? Can programs preserve
their autonomy, including the right to experiment
with unorthodox structures of governance? Can
they prevent administrative interference, yet
simultaneously cultivate administrative support?
Can practitioners recognize and deal creatively
with conflicts rooted in difference of status, conflicts between tenured and untenured faculty
women, for example, or between faculty and
graduate and undergraduate students? To what
extent can nonhierarchical, consensual structures of administration be created, and how
can practitioners resolve the contradictions and
paradoxes that arise when such experiments

`Woolf, Virginia (1882–1941) 
British feminist writer. The history of Virginia Woolf ’s
reception as one of the twentieth century’s major
feminist voices is tortuous and healthily problematic. Considerable reason for at least one
feature of what is a complicated case history may
be found within the patriarchal critical tradition.
Male critics have been either historically incapable
of registering, or variously reluctant to recognize
and weigh, the feminism that informs or drives
her writing (and not simply feminism: theorists
in Lesbian feminism carry the issue even farther
from the purlieus of the Patriarchy). E.M.
Forster (1941), who might have known differently,
advised readers that there were spots of feminism all over Woolf ’s work, as if, as has been
remarked, feminism were a disease, like chicken
pox. Forster saw and admitted that, as an elderly
male, he was unfitted to pass judgment on the subject, but none the less had his cake and ate it too.
Nor were male critics entirely alone. Q.D. Leavis
(1938), for example, could only choke on what
she saw to be privilege and elitism in Woolf’s
position and a belle-lettrist frivolity in her style.

Woolf, Virginia

collide with established or required institutional
procedures? How, for example, can teachers
attempt to create an egalitarian classroom climate
and then assign grades?
Finally, women’s studies shares certain problems with academics generally, problems which
the rapid growth of women’s studies and its
commitment to interdisciplinary inquiry have
only exacerbated. Chief among these is the
enormous expansion of knowledge, how to cope
with the burgeoning scholarship and proliferation
of theories and methods. Although women’s
studies has produced fine tools and guides for
research, including Feminist Periodicals, Feminist Collections, and New Books on Women and
Feminism (all produced by the University of
Wisconsin Women’s Studies Librarian), Women’s
Studies Abstracts, and Susan Searing’s Introduction to Library Research in Women’s Studies
(1985) for undergraduates, it lacks the equivalent
of, say, Harner’s Literary Research Guide in English.
Such tools, of course, do not solve the greater problem of how to find the time and energy, not only
to read, but also to think – broadly and freely. It
is desirable that scholars in women’s studies,
along with scholars everywhere else in academia,
resist the temptation to manage this proliferation
of knowledge by becoming more and more
narrowly specialized, more and more indifferent
to the complex relationships between branches
of study, the possibilities of cross-fertilization
between them, and how they are located in,
shaped by, and in turn shape the world at large.

However, when in the 1960s and 1970s a number of events conjoined – the feminist revolution
in North America; publication of Quentin Bell’s
biography, the subsequent issue of the letters
and diaries – Woolf found the kind of acclaim that
a few critics and many women readers (among
them those, from all social classes, whose letters
to her may be read in the Monks House Papers
at Sussex University) had all along seen to be her
due. She was a radical voice, in a great tradition
that embraces Mary Wollstonecraft and, as
now might be added, Simone de Beauvoir and
Julia Kristeva, and a more obscure tradition
written by Margaret Paston, or Judith Shakespeare
and company: Margaret Cavendish, Dorothy
Osborne, Anne Finch, Laetitia Pilkington, Maria
Edgeworth, etc. By no manner of means was the
new critical climate without controversy, both
within and without the feminist debate. The
issues are numerous but seem most yieldingly to
focus where Aesthetics and social history are
embroiled.
That Virginia Woolf was a “lady” of Victorian
birth is something she wisely never sought to
evade. Lady into woman was an emancipatory
metamorphosis too far to be completely negotiable
for her. No more could the twentieth become discontinuous with the nineteenth century, dramatic
caesurae, such as the Great War of 1914–18,
notwithstanding. Woolf’s hero/heroine Orlando
might effect a truly startling transition from
man into woman, but there was no question that
Virginia Woolf could become, let us say, another
Katherine Mansfield (hence in some measure
her ambivalent fascination and rivalry with
Mansfield). Everything precluded it, not least
her entrenched prejudices about the underworld
of bohemia. (It is symptomatic that, for example,
Woolf wrote for Bruce Richmond’s Times Literary
Supplement (TLS), not A.R. Orage’s New Age;
her version of modernism is strictly English,
in spite of post-impressionism, and, in a sense,
deeply traditional.) Still less could she begin to
speak for the working class. (Her honesty and good
sense regarding her ignorance of working-class
Culture informs most notably her introduction
to Life As We Have Known It, 1931.) She was born
into a connection which Annan (1955), unwittingly
and inappropriately borrowing a phrase from
George Meredith’s The Ordeal of Richard Feverel
(1859), has identified as that most oxymoronic of

cultural phenomena (more moronic than oxy?) “the
intellectual aristocracy.” By this Annan meant a
network of upper middle-class, generally Oxbridge
(and predominantly Cambridge) related, interconnected families whose sires and scions held
sway at the universities, upon the bench, and, inter
alia, in the administration of the British Empire.
Woolf herself did not attend a university. It was
a matter at once of grievance and considerable
satisfaction to her, in her conception of herself
as an “outsider.” She found her schooling in
the library of her father, the muscularly agnostic
alpinist, editor, biographer, critic, literary historian, and philosopher, Leslie Stephen, and,
briefly enough, at the knee of such women as
Clara Pater, and the inspiration of others, like
Jane Harrison. Cambridge was the university to
which she did not go, and it was through Cambridge, where her more privileged brothers
studied, that she met the young men, including
her future husband, who were together to form
what became known as the Bloomsbury Group.
Bloomsbury’s Aesthetics derived from or
were cogently mediated by G.E. Moore, whose
emphasis upon the value of aesthetic enjoyment as an end in itself fitted comfortably with
Paterian ideas and, subsequently, postimpressionist theory, which Clive Bell and, more substantially, Roger Fry were to cultivate, and which
finds expression in Woolf’s own criticism and
theorizing about an impersonal, autonomous,
epiphanic, and transcendental (but relentlessly
secular) literary art.
A major critical maneuver, by feminists such
as Marcus (1982), was to wrench Woolf from this
background, to deny it, and the process, in some
measure since redressed and readdressed, proved
for the most part a vitally useful dislocation. It
also helped liberate Woolf from the chimerae
of sickbed, sofa, and ivory tower to which even
Forster, to say nothing of F.R. Leavis, had variously confined her. (Raymond Williams, for
his part, had no difficulty in accounting rather
positively for the phenomenon of Bloomsbury,
as a dissenting fraction of the upper class, or for
Woolf’s aesthetic of the momentary – but then
he skirted the question of her feminism.) With
or without Bloomsbury, however, the issue of
Woolf’s ideas about pure and impure Art
remains problematic, for those ideas were also
more fundamentally socially conditioned. Her

737
whose The Waste Land she typeset by hand for
the Hogarth Press’s first English edition of that
poem. As a novelist-critic she developed and
promoted her own blend of impressionism and
psychological realism (see Erich Auerbach),
opposing, notably, the “impure” “materialism” of
her Edwardian contemporaries. Many of her key
essays explore and develop ideas from which her
fictional experiments grew, though once again the
obliquity of her essay style has for some critics
obscured the view. Woolf’s feminist position
naturally led for her to a revisory Canon. Her
theories of reading, as expressed in The Common
Reader (1925, 1932) collections and numerous
other essays, anticipate much in current Readerresponse criticism, down to the ideas of Stanley
Fish concerning “reading communities.”
From misread aesthete, Virginia Woolf has been
reread, especially since 1970, to achieve a status
scarcely less elevated than that of Shakespeare, as
a cultural icon of the age.

`writerly and readerly texts 
(usual translations of French scriptible and lisible.) A pair
of terms introduced by Roland Barthes in his
book S/Z, a brilliant and meticulous (almost
sentence-by-sentence) close reading of Balzac’s
novella Sarrasine. The readerly, or “classic realist,” Text is one that observes all those cultural
Codes and conventions which the reader expects
of a well-made narrative. It can thus be consumed
(so to speak) without remainder as a piece of
straightforward mimetic Discourse whose fictive
or textual status is forgotten for the sake of just
enjoying the story or following the fortunes of its
various protagonists. The writerly text, on the other
hand, is one that permits of no such easy escape

will toward obliquity, as well as being grounded
in rhetorical and aesthetic theory, was, by her own
acknowledgement, governed by notions of good
manners and polite conversation, as cultivated, for
example, at the Victorian tea-table. In a work of
high symbolism like, for example, To the Lighthouse (1927), a considered obliquity is essential
and enriching. Carried far enough it will carry
the price of obscurity. Carried into ostensibly
polemical writing, such as A Room of One’s Own
(1929) and the visionary Three Guineas (1938)
(which in a revolutionary and profoundly controversial way binds feminism and pacificism
together), it may be, some have argued (notably
Elaine Showalter), that it has been carried too
far. This possibility has provided the crux in a
major debate concerning Woolf’s rhetorical strategies, their literary and sociopolitical effectiveness,
the nature of feminist Discourse, and the issue
of self-censorship (upon which contentious question consult, for example, Rosenbaum (1992).
Toril Moi and, subsequently, Silver (1991a and b)
have been prominent among critics engaged
upon these issues, while the theories of Sandra
Gilbert and Susan Gubar, concerning “feminine
‘swerves’ ” and conversational style have helped
nourish fruitfully charitable readings of Woolf’s
maneuvers, such as those by Cuddy-Keane (1996).
Feminist readings of Woolf’s novels and
criticism have anchored her work in “the real
world,” as Zwerdling (1986) has termed it, and
freed her for us from the constraints of her
Formalism. An important materialist position has
been forcefully argued by Barrett (1979), while
Abel (1989) has, with great acuity, written from
the viewpoint of Psychoanalysis. The major
subjects of Woolf’s fictions are now seen to be
the patriarchy and the family (see notably To the
Lighthouse, and The Years (1937)), identity and
the self (see Mrs Dalloway (1925), and, especially,
The Waves (1931)), war (see for an oblique
approach, Jacob’s Room (1922), Mrs Dalloway, the
“Time passes” section in To the Lighthouse, and
Between the Acts (1941)), empire (see Mrs Dalloway
and The Waves), the nature of time, consciousness, memory and history, and language itself
(she could talk of a linear verbal art in terms
of statuary, an art that was “eyeless” and monumental). Woolf owed considerable debts to the
writings of James Joyce, whose work she none
the less famously condemned, and to T.S. Eliot

illusion which Barthes identifies with the workings of bourgeois Ideology. It is the kind of
text that resists mere passive consumption – or
which holds out against those conformist habits
of response – by refusing the reader a stable, selfassured subject position from which he or she
can share in the author’s omniscient view of
characters and events. This it does by disrupting
those various narrative codes (the proairetic,
hermeneutic, semic, cultural, and symbolic) which
weave and intersect at every point in the text and
whose breakdown generates a “scandal” in the
naturalized order of meaning and representation.
At the limit such writing would aspire to the
condition of an infinitized “freeplay” of Signs,
a domain of intertextual traces and allusions
where the author function is dissolved into an open
polyphony of surrogate voices.
For Barthes – as for other French literary theorists in the late 1960s, Philippe Sollers among
them – this ideal is attained (or most nearly
attained) by a text like Joyce’s Finnegans Wake
(1939). What is here in prospect is a writing that
transgresses all the orthodox values – of coherence, linear plot structure, extratextual reference,
character interest, social and historical specificity, etc. – imposed by the generic conventions
of the novel as a high bourgeois artform. Those
conventions operate (so Barthes argues) in the
manner of all such mythic ideologies, that is, by
transforming “Culture” into “nature,” or passing off as timeless, transcendent truths what in fact
are mere items of class-based “commonsense”
belief or products of some localized cultural
doxa. S/Z may thus be seen as marking the point
of transition from those early works of Barthes
(like Mythologies, 1957) which adopted a broadly
structuralist approach in demystifying bourgeois
sign Systems to the later (post-1970) phase which
produced such influential essays as “The death
of the author” and “From work to text.”
The lisible/scriptible distinction enjoyed a high
profile among literary theorists during the decade
or so of intensive poststructuralist debate that
followed the book’s publication. However, it also
gave rise to some problems fairly typical of the
heady rhetoric which characterized that period
of endlessly deferred textual “revolutions that
as yet have no model.” These included the somewhat mandarin idea of “Signifying practice”
as a substitute for real-world engagement; the

dubious appeal to texts like Finnegans Wake
as somehow more “radical” than texts with an
overtly critical, progressive, or social-realist
content; and the fondness for typecast generic
oppositions – like writerly versus readerly –
which left no room for more subtle or nuanced
approaches. “Bliss was it in that dawn to be
alive,” sure enough, but a bliss rather oddly out
of touch with events off-page.

`writing
 A concept that figures prominently in
the thought of Derrida, Barthes, Foucault,
Cixous, and other theorists. Before the advent of
sound recordings, writing differed from speech in
that it was the form of language that did not rely
on the presence of the one who used it. Because
it makes possible the preservation and transmission of Discourse, writing has been highly
prized but also surprisingly condemned. For Plato
it is a threat to memory, and for Saussure it is
a monstrous imposition on speech. If spoken
language is one step removed from thought,
then writing may be thought a supplement to
a supplement. Cixous, however, observes that
because a piece of writing continues to produce
an apparently unlimited number of readings and
rewritings, it persists in deferring any definitive
sense of meaning. Women, she argues, have a
privileged position in relation to writing. Of
Grammatology is Derrida’s manifesto for launching a new science of writing in order to challenge
concealed assumptions about speech that have
important implications for Western metaphysics
and Culture.

`Yates, Frances Amelia (1899–1981)
Renaissance historian who, after an unconventional
early education, began to live on small family
resources as a private scholar. Her first academic
appointment, in 1941, was to the staff of the
Warburg Institute, which had escaped from
Germany in 1933 but was not yet part of the University of London.
Frances Yates’s London MA thesis on sixteenthcentury French social drama led her to the
religio-political refugee language teachers of
Elizabethan England, particularly John Florio
(1553?–1625), the subject of her first book (1934)
and his father, as well as to the Italian heretical
philosopher, Giordano Bruno (1548–1600). In A
Study of Love’s Labour’s Lost (1936) she attempted
to revise current views of Florio’s influence on
Shakespeare, seeing the opposition of poetic and
pedantic language as a chief theme of the play
and proposing for it a relevance to contemporary
religious thought.
In 1937 these interests brought her into contact with the Warburg and kept her associated
with it until her death. She learned to apply
the pragmatic, encyclopedic, historical approach
and European outlook of its members to her lifelong preoccupation with the religious, cultural, and
intellectual milieu of Elizabethan England. Her
influential essay on Queen Elizabeth I as Astraea
(1947), later issued (1975) with her other studies
of Renaissance imperial aspirations as expressed
in Symbolism, Writings, Art, and pageantry,

owed much to Aby Warburg (1866–1929) and
Fritz Saxl (1890–1948). So did her book The
Valois Tapestries (1959). She was also much
indebted to D.P. Walker (1914–85), particularly
in The French Academies of the Sixteenth Century
(1948), in which she explored French mystical
encyclopedism and its attempts to foster a harmony of all knowledge for the betterment of the
vita activa.
These studies, published by the Warburg,
had already given Frances Yates a high if narrow
reputation when she embarked on the phase
of her work that was to make her more widely
known, though not until she was in her midsixties. In 1949 she began to occupy herself again
with Bruno, with the aim of explaining the
nature, antecedents, and historical significance
of his thought. Having perceived the importance
of Bruno’s acknowledged debt to Ramon Lull
(c.1233–c.1315), she first studied Lull’s project
for a true and fundamental logic which could
be applied to all arts and sciences. She also
emphasized Bruno’s appraisal of Jewish Kabbalah,
in which he followed Pico della Mirandola
(1463–94). Bruno’s references to the mythical
Egyptian magus Hermes Trismegistus, an important Platonic witness in Renaissance eyes, especially
Marsilio Ficino’s (1433–99), led her to emphasize the significance of Hermes for Bruno’s belief
in a sun-centered universe. To her Bruno’s reading of the Copernican cosmology was Hermetic,
vitalistic, and visionary, the hieroglyph of a

magical religion which would restore world
harmony. The supposed argument of Giordano
Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (1964), that
Bruno was the precursor of the scientific revolution, the so-called Yates thesis, gave rise to
controversy and opposition from historians of
science. The Art of Memory (1966) was, however,
generally accepted and recognized as important
for the understanding of Renaissance rhetoric
and poetics. It traced the ancestry and influence
of Bruno’s system of artificial memory, designed
to strengthen the mind’s natural mnemonic
powers. Having their origin in classical oratory,
as she showed, such schemes took on a universal
character in the Renaissance.
The works of Frances Yates’s last decade, such
as Theatre of the World (1969), The Rosicrucian
Enlightenment (1972), Shakespeare’s Last Plays
(1975), and The Occult Philosophy in Elizabethan

England (1979), developed themes and preoccupations from these books. They were severely
criticized, especially for the boldness of the claims
advanced for the importance of particular individuals, notably John Dee (1527–1609) and Robert
Fludd (1574–1637), and intellectual currents.
Her place as a highly individual, powerful, and
lasting influence on the study of Renaissance
thinking, belief, and modes of expression, as
well as Renaissance literature (a concept she
repudiated), is nevertheless secure.

Žižek, Slavoj

Z

`Žižek, Slavoj (1949–) 
Slovenian philosopher
and cultural theorist. One of the most important influences on nioek’s prolific and diverse
writing has been the thought of Jacques Lacan.
Without becoming in the least a slavish disciple of Lacan, nioek has productively amplified
and developed Lacanian thought in ways that
were uniquely but briefly anticipated by Louis
Althusser. In his helpful Preface to nioek’s
The Sublime Object of Ideology, Ernesto Laclau
has distinguished the Slovenian reception of
Lacan from that in Anglo-Saxon, French, and
Latin cultures. In Slovenia the emphasis has
been on the political and philosophical implications of Lacanian Psychoanalysis. Along with
several colleagues at the Institute for Sociology
in Ljubljana, nioek has employed Lacanian
theory in dealing with the mechanisms of
political Ideology and in analyzing traditional
philosophical texts, especially those of Hegel

and Kant. A distinctive feature of nioek’s
writing is his determination to be provocative –
to open up discussion and to stimulate new
work – rather than to be reductively definitive.
His own influence has very quickly become
widespread in Cultural studies, film theory,
psychoanalysis, and philosophy. nioek’s boldest
intellectual efforts in numerous books – which
are at once learned, profound, playful, and politically committed – have been in crossing the
divide that has often been thought impassable
between psychoanalysis and Marxism, Art and
ideology, traditional philosophy and Popular
culture.
